then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .

that is 850 more than the european average .
and smoking kills 50,000 people a year in spain , 16 percent of all deaths among those aged more than 35 , according to the ministry of health .
drastic steps such drastic steps were needed in spain because unlike its european neighbors , the country had no previous laws curbing tobacco use , salgado was quoted as saying by the europa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new campaign aims to save thousands of lives thus , the move towards anti-smoking laws " has been faster -lrb- in spain -rrb- than seen in other countries " , salgado said , while predicting that conflicts over the new laws would be " minimal . " given polls showing an approval rate for the smoking laws of 77 percent , they would be " respected by everyone , " the health minister said , including the estimated 8-10 million smokers among spain 's 44 million population . smoking is now banned in bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters -lrb- 1,070 square feet -rrb- except in special sections , which may not occupy more than 30 percent of the total space . bars and restaurants smaller than 100 square meters can opt to be smoking or non-smoking but have to say clearly which they are . smoking areas can also be set aside in other establishments , including hotels , prisons , airports , stations and ports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and other eu countries have already instituted bans initial signs were that the ban was taking time to be respected - on sunday morning a handful of smokers could still be seen on madrid 's metro , which stayed open all night for the new year , despite the threat of fines ranging from 30 euros to a whopping 600,000 euros -lrb- 35 to 710,000 dollars -rrb- . but some are pleased with the measure . " i like it , " antonio rios , a 25-year-old computer services worker in madrid told bloomberg .

both join a growing list of european countries such as ireland , italy and sweden who are trying to curb smoking as european governments try to reduce the cost of treating tobacco-related diseases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 germany ’ s immigration law marks one year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't done so much for immigrants in germany for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .
and security officials welcome another provision in the bill which permits foreign political and religious extremists to be deported more swiftly than in the past . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .
it took a case brought before the european court of justice in 2000 by tanja kreil .
a trained electrician , kreil felt discriminated against when her application to the bundeswehr was rejected not because of her qualifications , but because of her gender .
on jan .
11 , 2000 , the judges agreed with kreil - a decision welcomed by those german women for whom the dream of joining the army had become a real possibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has been open to women since 2001 " it 's just the whole environment , the camaraderie , the physicality and the whole training , " said one of germany 's first female soldiers , who declined to be named .
" it always fascinated me , even as a small child , and it was always a dream of mine to join the army . " following the ruling , the german government had to change the country 's basic law , which , in article 12 , expressly forbad women from armed service . breaking up the boys ' club during the first two decades of its existence , the bundeswehr , which was established in 1955 , was exclusively a boys ' club .
starting in 1975 , women were permitted to serve only in medical units or musical bands . but after winning the right to serve in fighting units alongside men , 244 women joined the bundeswehr in january 2001 - on a voluntary basis .
compulsory military service for women is still prohibited by law . five years ago , a new era of change began for the bundeswehr , from logistical adjustments such as separate barracks and facilities for women , to behavioral adjustments in the way male training officers deal with their female charges . female soldiers generally agree that they do n't want any special treatment , but especially in the beginning , cases of sexual harassment by male training officers or male recruits did crop up .
bundeswehr officials made sure that offenders were strictly punished , and ran special seminars for officers on preventing sexual harassment . today , women make up 6 percent of bundeswehr soldiers .
it will probably take another five years before a woman can become a company commander , and another 15 years before an entire battalion will be commanded by a woman .
german army officials recognize that they 've not yet exhausted the kind of contributions women can make to the bundeswehr .
serving as an example of that are the 300 women currently taking part in foreign missions - something that was considered unthinkable only a few short years ago . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 50 years of the bundeswehr the german army , or bundeswehr , has gone through many changes and has faced many diverse challenges since its formation in 1955 .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .

though shot up during military exercises , the remains of a church , a school and an electrical sub-station are still visible . a visitors ' center will be the first thing built to mark the changes at burg vogelsang .
a nazi documentation center , a european youth center and exhibitions about the park and regional history are also planned . for now though , security guards patrol the grounds to prevent former nazis and neo-nazis from making " pilgrimages " to the third reich 's old school . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .
it took a case brought before the european court of justice in 2000 by tanja kreil .
a trained electrician , kreil felt discriminated against when her application to the bundeswehr was rejected not because of her qualifications , but because of her gender .
on jan .
11 , 2000 , the judges agreed with kreil - a decision welcomed by those german women for whom the dream of joining the army had become a real possibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has been open to women since 2001 " it 's just the whole environment , the camaraderie , the physicality and the whole training , " said one of germany 's first female soldiers , who declined to be named .
" it always fascinated me , even as a small child , and it was always a dream of mine to join the army . " following the ruling , the german government had to change the country 's basic law , which , in article 12 , expressly forbad women from armed service . breaking up the boys ' club during the first two decades of its existence , the bundeswehr , which was established in 1955 , was exclusively a boys ' club .
starting in 1975 , women were permitted to serve only in medical units or musical bands . but after winning the right to serve in fighting units alongside men , 244 women joined the bundeswehr in january 2001 - on a voluntary basis .
compulsory military service for women is still prohibited by law . five years ago , a new era of change began for the bundeswehr , from logistical adjustments such as separate barracks and facilities for women , to behavioral adjustments in the way male training officers deal with their female charges . female soldiers generally agree that they do n't want any special treatment , but especially in the beginning , cases of sexual harassment by male training officers or male recruits did crop up .
bundeswehr officials made sure that offenders were strictly punished , and ran special seminars for officers on preventing sexual harassment . today , women make up 6 percent of bundeswehr soldiers .
it will probably take another five years before a woman can become a company commander , and another 15 years before an entire battalion will be commanded by a woman .
german army officials recognize that they 've not yet exhausted the kind of contributions women can make to the bundeswehr .
serving as an example of that are the 300 women currently taking part in foreign missions - something that was considered unthinkable only a few short years ago . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 50 years of the bundeswehr the german army , or bundeswehr , has gone through many changes and has faced many diverse challenges since its formation in 1955 .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .

he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .

he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear power plants are set to be shut by 2020 economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute . germany should rethink what can be done to make the country less dependent on foreign energy sources , glos said in an interview with wdr radio .
he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .

"
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote .

" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .

in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law .

" a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .
it took a case brought before the european court of justice in 2000 by tanja kreil .
a trained electrician , kreil felt discriminated against when her application to the bundeswehr was rejected not because of her qualifications , but because of her gender .
on jan .
11 , 2000 , the judges agreed with kreil - a decision welcomed by those german women for whom the dream of joining the army had become a real possibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has been open to women since 2001 " it 's just the whole environment , the camaraderie , the physicality and the whole training , " said one of germany 's first female soldiers , who declined to be named .
" it always fascinated me , even as a small child , and it was always a dream of mine to join the army . " following the ruling , the german government had to change the country 's basic law , which , in article 12 , expressly forbad women from armed service . breaking up the boys ' club during the first two decades of its existence , the bundeswehr , which was established in 1955 , was exclusively a boys ' club .
starting in 1975 , women were permitted to serve only in medical units or musical bands . but after winning the right to serve in fighting units alongside men , 244 women joined the bundeswehr in january 2001 - on a voluntary basis .
compulsory military service for women is still prohibited by law . five years ago , a new era of change began for the bundeswehr , from logistical adjustments such as separate barracks and facilities for women , to behavioral adjustments in the way male training officers deal with their female charges . female soldiers generally agree that they do n't want any special treatment , but especially in the beginning , cases of sexual harassment by male training officers or male recruits did crop up .
bundeswehr officials made sure that offenders were strictly punished , and ran special seminars for officers on preventing sexual harassment . today , women make up 6 percent of bundeswehr soldiers .
it will probably take another five years before a woman can become a company commander , and another 15 years before an entire battalion will be commanded by a woman .
german army officials recognize that they 've not yet exhausted the kind of contributions women can make to the bundeswehr .
serving as an example of that are the 300 women currently taking part in foreign missions - something that was considered unthinkable only a few short years ago . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 50 years of the bundeswehr the german army , or bundeswehr , has gone through many changes and has faced many diverse challenges since its formation in 1955 .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .
however , the kremlin 's strategy to use its energy supplies to become integrated into the world community as a reliable partner has been badly damaged due to the escalation of the russian-ukrainian gas dispute . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 germany ’ s immigration law marks one year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't done so much for immigrants in germany for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures .

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .

according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .

some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas delivery dispute hits eu germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's nuclear power plants are set to be shut by 2020 economics minister michael glos suggested germany could backtrack on its decision to stop using nuclear power as natural gas companies reported disruptions in supplies from russia due to the moscow-kiev gas dispute . germany should rethink what can be done to make the country less dependent on foreign energy sources , glos said in an interview with wdr radio .
he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

the complex is the best maintained example of third reich architecture in germany , and since jan .
1 it 's open to the public . since the us army occupied burg vogelsang , one of the nazi 's four elite schools , in 1945 hardly a civilian has had a chance to see it .
british and later belgian soldiers used the building and its 33-square meter -lrb- 21-square mile -rrb- exercise grounds for training .
vogelsang 's future took a new turn when the eifel national park was established there in 2004 and the belgians evacuated and handed the lands to the public on jan .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guided tours are a safe way to go village as shooting range at the heart of the park is the village of wollseifen , whose 550 inhabitants were evicted by british soldiers after the war .
though shot up during military exercises , the remains of a church , a school and an electrical sub-station are still visible . a visitors ' center will be the first thing built to mark the changes at burg vogelsang .
a nazi documentation center , a european youth center and exhibitions about the park and regional history are also planned . for now though , security guards patrol the grounds to prevent former nazis and neo-nazis from making " pilgrimages " to the third reich 's old school . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

" given polls showing an approval rate for the smoking laws of 77 percent , they would be " respected by everyone , " the health minister said , including the estimated 8-10 million smokers among spain 's 44 million population . smoking is now banned in bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters -lrb- 1,070 square feet -rrb- except in special sections , which may not occupy more than 30 percent of the total space . bars and restaurants smaller than 100 square meters can opt to be smoking or non-smoking but have to say clearly which they are . smoking areas can also be set aside in other establishments , including hotels , prisons , airports , stations and ports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and other eu countries have already instituted bans initial signs were that the ban was taking time to be respected - on sunday morning a handful of smokers could still be seen on madrid 's metro , which stayed open all night for the new year , despite the threat of fines ranging from 30 euros to a whopping 600,000 euros -lrb- 35 to 710,000 dollars -rrb- . but some are pleased with the measure .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .

europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .

gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .

it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .

if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 germany ’ s immigration law marks one year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't done so much for immigrants in germany for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .
and security officials welcome another provision in the bill which permits foreign political and religious extremists to be deported more swiftly than in the past . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

others say it 's doing the best it can with limited resources .

the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .

some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .

russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .

that is 850 more than the european average .
and smoking kills 50,000 people a year in spain , 16 percent of all deaths among those aged more than 35 , according to the ministry of health .
drastic steps such drastic steps were needed in spain because unlike its european neighbors , the country had no previous laws curbing tobacco use , salgado was quoted as saying by the europa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new campaign aims to save thousands of lives thus , the move towards anti-smoking laws " has been faster -lrb- in spain -rrb- than seen in other countries " , salgado said , while predicting that conflicts over the new laws would be " minimal . " given polls showing an approval rate for the smoking laws of 77 percent , they would be " respected by everyone , " the health minister said , including the estimated 8-10 million smokers among spain 's 44 million population . smoking is now banned in bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters -lrb- 1,070 square feet -rrb- except in special sections , which may not occupy more than 30 percent of the total space . bars and restaurants smaller than 100 square meters can opt to be smoking or non-smoking but have to say clearly which they are . smoking areas can also be set aside in other establishments , including hotels , prisons , airports , stations and ports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and other eu countries have already instituted bans initial signs were that the ban was taking time to be respected - on sunday morning a handful of smokers could still be seen on madrid 's metro , which stayed open all night for the new year , despite the threat of fines ranging from 30 euros to a whopping 600,000 euros -lrb- 35 to 710,000 dollars -rrb- . but some are pleased with the measure . " i like it , " antonio rios , a 25-year-old computer services worker in madrid told bloomberg .
" having to stand in the cold will make me smoke less . " growing restrictions belgium also implemented new smoking restrictions .
both join a growing list of european countries such as ireland , italy and sweden who are trying to curb smoking as european governments try to reduce the cost of treating tobacco-related diseases .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .

according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .

some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .

europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's anti-smoking battle eu tv campaign makes fun of smoking britain to impose sweeping smoking ban smoking ban begins in italy sweden bans smoking europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 spanish face smoke-free new year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers are left in the cold in spain spain 's legions of smokers were facing a tough new year on sunday as strict new laws banning smoking in public places came into force , abruptly reversing the nation 's traditional tobacco-friendly attitude . spaniards , the heaviest smokers in europe apart from the greeks , will no longer be able to light up in a huge range of public spaces , including food shops , many bars and restaurants and all workplaces . even those working in their own separate offices would not be permitted a cigarette , health minister elena salgado explained on sunday , " so as to avoid any distinction between people in high-up jobs and those further down the hierarchy " . millions of signs reading " prohibido fumar , " or " no smoking , " have sprung up in work places , bars and restaurants and public buildings around the country , which first imported the tobacco habit into europe 500 years ago . at the same time , curbs on the advertising and sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products have been introduced . spain 's 40 million people on average consume 2,300 cigarettes a year .
that is 850 more than the european average .
and smoking kills 50,000 people a year in spain , 16 percent of all deaths among those aged more than 35 , according to the ministry of health .
drastic steps such drastic steps were needed in spain because unlike its european neighbors , the country had no previous laws curbing tobacco use , salgado was quoted as saying by the europa news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new campaign aims to save thousands of lives thus , the move towards anti-smoking laws " has been faster -lrb- in spain -rrb- than seen in other countries " , salgado said , while predicting that conflicts over the new laws would be " minimal . " given polls showing an approval rate for the smoking laws of 77 percent , they would be " respected by everyone , " the health minister said , including the estimated 8-10 million smokers among spain 's 44 million population . smoking is now banned in bars and restaurants larger than 100 square meters -lrb- 1,070 square feet -rrb- except in special sections , which may not occupy more than 30 percent of the total space . bars and restaurants smaller than 100 square meters can opt to be smoking or non-smoking but have to say clearly which they are . smoking areas can also be set aside in other establishments , including hotels , prisons , airports , stations and ports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden and other eu countries have already instituted bans initial signs were that the ban was taking time to be respected - on sunday morning a handful of smokers could still be seen on madrid 's metro , which stayed open all night for the new year , despite the threat of fines ranging from 30 euros to a whopping 600,000 euros -lrb- 35 to 710,000 dollars -rrb- . but some are pleased with the measure . " i like it , " antonio rios , a 25-year-old computer services worker in madrid told bloomberg .
" having to stand in the cold will make me smoke less . " growing restrictions belgium also implemented new smoking restrictions .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 germany ’ s immigration law marks one year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't done so much for immigrants in germany for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .
and security officials welcome another provision in the bill which permits foreign political and religious extremists to be deported more swiftly than in the past . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

" despite everything , i love yemen , " said chrobog . the five were released saturday after security forces backed by army solders laid siege to the kidnappers ' hideout in the small village of al-saeed and seized four hostage-takers . accusations of carelessness it was the fourth abduction of foreign tourists in yemen this year .
two austrians were freed in december after being held for three days . chrobog said " he would never put himself or his family at risk during a vacation . " he also rejected the accusations that he and his family were careless about where they wanted to spend their vacations . " that is absolutely grotesque .
i would never go to iraq or afghanistan , or look at the prehistoric cities in columbia , " he said . tribal dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red circle around the location where the chrobog family was taken hostage the family was seized by tribesmen who reportedly sought to use them as bargaining chips in a tribal vendetta .
they were abducted from a restaurant on the road between the port city of aden and shabwa , which lies 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa . " we were worried during the first few hours after we were kidnapped .
but the kidnappers told us they were not terrorists , " chrobog said , adding that he then felt " reassured . " however , he noted that " during our time in captivity , we saw some children of the tribe were carrying guns when they should have been at school . " " i think that this country 's problem is education .
such children should be in schools , " he said .
" but it seems unfortunately that there are no schools -lrb- in their region -rrb- and so they have to create tribal zones to resolve their problems . " presidential reception yemeni president ali abdullah saleh received the former hostages at the presidential palace prior to their departure , where he wished them a happy new year and assured them that their kidnappers would be " punished . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and his wife leave the republican palace in aden , yemen " kidnappings are unacceptable and against the law , " saleh said , adding that the germans ' kidnapping did not have " political motives " and therefore was not " an act of terrorism . " " it was the work of individuals disowned by their society and their tribe .
they will have to account for their actions and they will be punished , " saleh said . three yemeni drivers were also freed along with the family . their release followed mediation efforts by a team made up of tribal chiefs and government representatives who negotiated with the hostage-takers . tribal chief sheikh al-ahmar ali al-aswad was said by tribal sources to have been holding the germans as bargaining chips for the release of the five brothers he said were wrongly imprisoned by yemeni authorities . five italians kidnapped yet in the wake of the happy ending for the chrobog family , security officials are reporting that five italian tourists were kidnapped by tribesman on sunday in the northern province of ma 'rib . a local government official said that three women were released shortly after and handed over to the local government in marib , while the two men remained captive . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kidnapped german family in yemen set free former german diplomat jürgen chrobog and his family were released by their captors on saturday .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .

" we expected the world cup to create 60,000 jobs and bring a 0.3-percent growth rate to the country next year , " dihk president ludwig georg braun said .
every third job opening created by the world cup is expected to be a permanent one .
the world cup will be held from june 9 to july 9 , 2006 in 12 german cities and will officially be the biggest soccer tournament ever .
the competition , which in its early years was contested by 16 finalists , rising to 24 in spain in 1982 , and to 32 in france in 1998 , will now feature 36 teams from all five continents .
a mega event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people will have to look for a job in 2006 thanks to the world cup with the world cup being the most popular tv event in the world and a global brand name , the tournament could potentially open doors to even more international markets for the hosting country .
according to the dihk study , which was based on a survey of around 20,000 companies , most of the jobs will be created in the areas of hospitality management , advertising , professional security and short-term employment services .
small business is expecting an increase of 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- euros during the world cup .
good news for germany the prediction that the world cup could have a positive impact on the german economy is particularly welcome in view of the new unemployment data published by the federal statistics office on monday .
according to the preliminary statistics for 2005 , the number of employed germans fell by 0.3 percent last year to about 38.7 million .
" the number of employed in 2005 fell , therefore , to roughly the same level as in 2003 , " the office said in a statement released monday .
the overall slight decline in employment , however , does not reveal the extent to which individual economic sectors were hit by recession .
construction , agriculture and manufacturing jobs contracted by 5.0 percent , 2.2 percent and 1.7 percent respectively . manufacturing accounted for 7.885 million , or 20.3 percent of all jobs in germany in 2005 , down from 20.6 percent in 2004 .
the services sector accounted for 27.870 million , or 71.9 percent of employment , up from 71.3 percent in 2004 , the office said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians divided over army deployment for world cup as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row gas delivery dispute hits eu press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kremlin is undermining its political influence in the ukraine dispute regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged . there 's no question that gazprom , russia 's state-owned energy company , has the right to demand ukraine pay a higher market price for natural gas more in keeping with international rates .
but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .
however , the kremlin 's strategy to use its energy supplies to become integrated into the world community as a reliable partner has been badly damaged due to the escalation of the russian-ukrainian gas dispute . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

" despite everything , i love yemen , " said chrobog . the five were released saturday after security forces backed by army solders laid siege to the kidnappers ' hideout in the small village of al-saeed and seized four hostage-takers . accusations of carelessness it was the fourth abduction of foreign tourists in yemen this year .
two austrians were freed in december after being held for three days . chrobog said " he would never put himself or his family at risk during a vacation . " he also rejected the accusations that he and his family were careless about where they wanted to spend their vacations . " that is absolutely grotesque .
i would never go to iraq or afghanistan , or look at the prehistoric cities in columbia , " he said . tribal dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red circle around the location where the chrobog family was taken hostage the family was seized by tribesmen who reportedly sought to use them as bargaining chips in a tribal vendetta .
they were abducted from a restaurant on the road between the port city of aden and shabwa , which lies 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa . " we were worried during the first few hours after we were kidnapped .
but the kidnappers told us they were not terrorists , " chrobog said , adding that he then felt " reassured . " however , he noted that " during our time in captivity , we saw some children of the tribe were carrying guns when they should have been at school . " " i think that this country 's problem is education .
such children should be in schools , " he said .
" but it seems unfortunately that there are no schools -lrb- in their region -rrb- and so they have to create tribal zones to resolve their problems . " presidential reception yemeni president ali abdullah saleh received the former hostages at the presidential palace prior to their departure , where he wished them a happy new year and assured them that their kidnappers would be " punished . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and his wife leave the republican palace in aden , yemen " kidnappings are unacceptable and against the law , " saleh said , adding that the germans ' kidnapping did not have " political motives " and therefore was not " an act of terrorism . " " it was the work of individuals disowned by their society and their tribe .
they will have to account for their actions and they will be punished , " saleh said . three yemeni drivers were also freed along with the family . their release followed mediation efforts by a team made up of tribal chiefs and government representatives who negotiated with the hostage-takers . tribal chief sheikh al-ahmar ali al-aswad was said by tribal sources to have been holding the germans as bargaining chips for the release of the five brothers he said were wrongly imprisoned by yemeni authorities . five italians kidnapped yet in the wake of the happy ending for the chrobog family , security officials are reporting that five italian tourists were kidnapped by tribesman on sunday in the northern province of ma 'rib . a local government official said that three women were released shortly after and handed over to the local government in marib , while the two men remained captive . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kidnapped german family in yemen set free former german diplomat jürgen chrobog and his family were released by their captors on saturday .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .
however , the kremlin 's strategy to use its energy supplies to become integrated into the world community as a reliable partner has been badly damaged due to the escalation of the russian-ukrainian gas dispute . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

the complex is the best maintained example of third reich architecture in germany , and since jan .
1 it 's open to the public . since the us army occupied burg vogelsang , one of the nazi 's four elite schools , in 1945 hardly a civilian has had a chance to see it .
british and later belgian soldiers used the building and its 33-square meter -lrb- 21-square mile -rrb- exercise grounds for training .
vogelsang 's future took a new turn when the eifel national park was established there in 2004 and the belgians evacuated and handed the lands to the public on jan .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator . "
he added that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had spoken to eu foreign policy chief javier solana and was planning to talk to his austrian counterpart ursula plassnik in a bid to find a common european position on the gas dispute . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy regardless of what happens in the russian-ukrainien gas dispute , the kremlin 's global foreign policy strategy has already been badly damaged .

the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits .

1 it 's open to the public . since the us army occupied burg vogelsang , one of the nazi 's four elite schools , in 1945 hardly a civilian has had a chance to see it .
british and later belgian soldiers used the building and its 33-square meter -lrb- 21-square mile -rrb- exercise grounds for training .
vogelsang 's future took a new turn when the eifel national park was established there in 2004 and the belgians evacuated and handed the lands to the public on jan .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guided tours are a safe way to go village as shooting range at the heart of the park is the village of wollseifen , whose 550 inhabitants were evicted by british soldiers after the war .
though shot up during military exercises , the remains of a church , a school and an electrical sub-station are still visible . a visitors ' center will be the first thing built to mark the changes at burg vogelsang .
a nazi documentation center , a european youth center and exhibitions about the park and regional history are also planned . for now though , security guards patrol the grounds to prevent former nazis and neo-nazis from making " pilgrimages " to the third reich 's old school . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

" " i think that this country 's problem is education .
such children should be in schools , " he said .

they will have to account for their actions and they will be punished , " saleh said . three yemeni drivers were also freed along with the family . their release followed mediation efforts by a team made up of tribal chiefs and government representatives who negotiated with the hostage-takers . tribal chief sheikh al-ahmar ali al-aswad was said by tribal sources to have been holding the germans as bargaining chips for the release of the five brothers he said were wrongly imprisoned by yemeni authorities . five italians kidnapped yet in the wake of the happy ending for the chrobog family , security officials are reporting that five italian tourists were kidnapped by tribesman on sunday in the northern province of ma 'rib . a local government official said that three women were released shortly after and handed over to the local government in marib , while the two men remained captive . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kidnapped german family in yemen set free former german diplomat jürgen chrobog and his family were released by their captors on saturday .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .
it took a case brought before the european court of justice in 2000 by tanja kreil .
a trained electrician , kreil felt discriminated against when her application to the bundeswehr was rejected not because of her qualifications , but because of her gender .
on jan .
11 , 2000 , the judges agreed with kreil - a decision welcomed by those german women for whom the dream of joining the army had become a real possibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has been open to women since 2001 " it 's just the whole environment , the camaraderie , the physicality and the whole training , " said one of germany 's first female soldiers , who declined to be named .
" it always fascinated me , even as a small child , and it was always a dream of mine to join the army . " following the ruling , the german government had to change the country 's basic law , which , in article 12 , expressly forbad women from armed service . breaking up the boys ' club during the first two decades of its existence , the bundeswehr , which was established in 1955 , was exclusively a boys ' club .
starting in 1975 , women were permitted to serve only in medical units or musical bands . but after winning the right to serve in fighting units alongside men , 244 women joined the bundeswehr in january 2001 - on a voluntary basis .
compulsory military service for women is still prohibited by law . five years ago , a new era of change began for the bundeswehr , from logistical adjustments such as separate barracks and facilities for women , to behavioral adjustments in the way male training officers deal with their female charges . female soldiers generally agree that they do n't want any special treatment , but especially in the beginning , cases of sexual harassment by male training officers or male recruits did crop up .
bundeswehr officials made sure that offenders were strictly punished , and ran special seminars for officers on preventing sexual harassment . today , women make up 6 percent of bundeswehr soldiers .
it will probably take another five years before a woman can become a company commander , and another 15 years before an entire battalion will be commanded by a woman .
german army officials recognize that they 've not yet exhausted the kind of contributions women can make to the bundeswehr .
serving as an example of that are the 300 women currently taking part in foreign missions - something that was considered unthinkable only a few short years ago . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 50 years of the bundeswehr the german army , or bundeswehr , has gone through many changes and has faced many diverse challenges since its formation in 1955 .

" however , he noted that " during our time in captivity , we saw some children of the tribe were carrying guns when they should have been at school . " " i think that this country 's problem is education .
such children should be in schools , " he said .
" but it seems unfortunately that there are no schools -lrb- in their region -rrb- and so they have to create tribal zones to resolve their problems . " presidential reception yemeni president ali abdullah saleh received the former hostages at the presidential palace prior to their departure , where he wished them a happy new year and assured them that their kidnappers would be " punished . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrobog and his wife leave the republican palace in aden , yemen " kidnappings are unacceptable and against the law , " saleh said , adding that the germans ' kidnapping did not have " political motives " and therefore was not " an act of terrorism . " " it was the work of individuals disowned by their society and their tribe .
they will have to account for their actions and they will be punished , " saleh said . three yemeni drivers were also freed along with the family . their release followed mediation efforts by a team made up of tribal chiefs and government representatives who negotiated with the hostage-takers . tribal chief sheikh al-ahmar ali al-aswad was said by tribal sources to have been holding the germans as bargaining chips for the release of the five brothers he said were wrongly imprisoned by yemeni authorities . five italians kidnapped yet in the wake of the happy ending for the chrobog family , security officials are reporting that five italian tourists were kidnapped by tribesman on sunday in the northern province of ma 'rib . a local government official said that three women were released shortly after and handed over to the local government in marib , while the two men remained captive . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kidnapped german family in yemen set free former german diplomat jürgen chrobog and his family were released by their captors on saturday .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .

europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .

it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .

it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .

" we expected the world cup to create 60,000 jobs and bring a 0.3-percent growth rate to the country next year , " dihk president ludwig georg braun said .
every third job opening created by the world cup is expected to be a permanent one .
the world cup will be held from june 9 to july 9 , 2006 in 12 german cities and will officially be the biggest soccer tournament ever .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage . " the 17 million german households -lrb- which use gas heating -rrb- for the moment have no cause for concern , " he said .
" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits . "
no plan to mediate meanwhile , deputy government spokesman thomas steg said germany had urged russia and ukraine to resolve the dispute as soon as possible , and without disrupting europe 's gas supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european consumers need n't yet worry " both sides have commitments and ... we expect both russia and ukraine to fulfill their obligations in terms of delivering and transporting gas in full , " he told a press briefing . steg said while the german government had been in touch with both moscow and kiev , it did not foresee " playing the role of negotiator .

the complex is the best maintained example of third reich architecture in germany , and since jan .
1 it 's open to the public . since the us army occupied burg vogelsang , one of the nazi 's four elite schools , in 1945 hardly a civilian has had a chance to see it .
british and later belgian soldiers used the building and its 33-square meter -lrb- 21-square mile -rrb- exercise grounds for training .
vogelsang 's future took a new turn when the eifel national park was established there in 2004 and the belgians evacuated and handed the lands to the public on jan .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guided tours are a safe way to go village as shooting range at the heart of the park is the village of wollseifen , whose 550 inhabitants were evicted by british soldiers after the war .
though shot up during military exercises , the remains of a church , a school and an electrical sub-station are still visible . a visitors ' center will be the first thing built to mark the changes at burg vogelsang .
a nazi documentation center , a european youth center and exhibitions about the park and regional history are also planned . for now though , security guards patrol the grounds to prevent former nazis and neo-nazis from making " pilgrimages " to the third reich 's old school . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .
however , the kremlin 's strategy to use its energy supplies to become integrated into the world community as a reliable partner has been badly damaged due to the escalation of the russian-ukrainian gas dispute . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.01.2006 germany ’ s immigration law marks one year großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law has n't done so much for immigrants in germany for years , germany shied away from regulating immigration .
then , a year ago , it finally put a new immigration law on the books which seems to have achieved very little . when germany ’ s first immigration law went into effect on january 1 , 2005 , former social democrat interior minister otto schily hailed it as the most modern legislation on immigration in all of europe . the bill sought to integrate those immigrants who are already here , streamline asylum procedures and put provisions in place for the recruitment of highly skilled foreigner nationals who would help revive the german economy . but its achievements have so far turned out to be rather modest . the campaign to lure foreign nationals with cutting-edge knowledge to germany - one of the main planks of the bill - has only managed to lure a meager 900 top-notch experts from abroad in the past year .
that is a figure that countries such as the united states or britain would laugh at . inadequate provisions under a previous green-card-like scheme , some 2,200 foreign experts annually agreed to work in germany .
the reason why many highly skilled people shy away from moving to germany is that their spouses do not automatically receive a work permit and wages for top performers are lower than elsewhere . the bill also lacks a point system which would help select the most promising migrants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legislators need to reform the law , experts say but michael bommes , an immigration expert from osnabrück , is hopeful that the governing grand coalition will soon make a number of necessary amendments . " the floor is open to reform this law pretty soon i guess because you want to have certain skilled migrants , " he said .
" this simply means having a point system in order to attract those that are being excluded presently . " some say an immigration bill can not be assessed only on the success or failure to recruit the best brains .
there are provisions in the law that aim to promote integration of immigrants , too .
for those who are already in germany , the bill has changed little but new arrivals are now entitled to german language and acclimatization courses concerning the country 's culture and its democratic institutions . not welcome here still , many complain that the law fails to get the message across that foreigners are really welcome in germany . rita süssmuth , a former german lawmaker who ’ s been advising the government on immigration issues , says this is largely because it was a compromise drawn up by rival conservatives and social democrats amid growing fears of terrorist attacks and climbing unemployment figures . " you ca n't integrate people if they do n't feel welcome so we have to work on this , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert and other conservatives are irritated over a lack of willingness to integrate conservative germans like bundestag president norbert lammert are aggrieved by the unwillingness of many migrants to take any interest in german society or learn the german language . one turkish girl from berlin ’ s wedding district agrees that this is a huge problem . " there are turkish markets , turkish doctors , turkish media and even turkish banks , " she said .
" you don ’ t need any german to get along here . " still , the immigration law has given residence permits to a large number of asylum seekers whose status had previously been in limbo .
and security officials welcome another provision in the bill which permits foreign political and religious extremists to be deported more swiftly than in the past . hardy graupner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror trial puts immigration office shortcomings in spotlight the judge who presided over a recent terrorism case has slammed germany 's immigration authority .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .

but the same goes for ukraine .
it wants to be paid better for the russian gas pipeline to europe that 's so important to gazprom .
at heart , both sides are closely dependent on each other , which should actually facilitate agreement . in addition , gazprom has itself recently demonstrated in its dealings with other former soviet republics that there 's a great margin for the price of gas .
with georgia , armenia and lithuania - not to mention the special case of belarus - it agreed on far lower gas prices than the $ 220- $ 230 -lrb- 186-194 euros -rrb- per cubic meter that it 's demanding from ukraine .
if purely commercial interests played a role in setting the price , a result acceptable for both sides would surely have been reached already . apparently another factor is at issue in the dispute with ukraine : russia is using its energy supplies to politically influence its neighbor .
it 's difficult to avoid the impression that the russians ' obstinate behavior in negotiations is meant to punish ukraine , which fell out of favor with the kremlin due to the pro-western orange revolution late last year . the russian threats and ultimatums are all the more cutting as ukrainian parliamentary elections are only three months away .
the " orange " camp , centered on the one time figureheads viktor yushchenko and yulia tymoshenko , is already deeply split .
numerous polls say pro-russian candidate viktor yanukovich 's party has the best chances .
freezing , or at least disillusioned , ukrainians could relegate the orange revolution to a short episode in their history .
bad damage to russia foreign policy the blatant use of russian energy supplies for foreign policy aims , however , cancels out putin 's strategy to employ the energy supplies to increase russia 's international influence .
for , in the gas dispute , russia does n't come across as a responsible energy supplier and a reliable partner , but as an unpredictable actor who ca n't be counted on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe will start looking elsewhere to cover its natural gas needs even if european consumers are spared shortfalls , one thing is clear : dependency on russian energy supplies means direct political dependency on the kremlin . those who issued warnings about russia 's imperial reflexes now see themselves proven right .
europe 's governments and energy firms will start searching more intensively for alternative suppliers and supply routes as well as ways to save energy and promote alternative energy sources .
and they are right to do so , since relying solely on russian gas and fair business conduct appears too risky .
but energy is n't a suitable political weapon - something the arab states have also discovered . it 's particularly ironic that russia assumed the presidency of the group of eight on january 1 .
moscow had previously declared that global energy supplies and russia 's role concerning them were among the most important issues for its g8 presidency .
however , the kremlin 's strategy to use its energy supplies to become integrated into the world community as a reliable partner has been badly damaged due to the escalation of the russian-ukrainian gas dispute . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russian turn at g8 helm seen as leadership test russia will take over the presidency of the g8 states for the first time in 2006 , despite the country 's questionable status in the club of the eight wealthiest nations .

the world cup will be held from june 9 to july 9 , 2006 in 12 german cities and will officially be the biggest soccer tournament ever .
the competition , which in its early years was contested by 16 finalists , rising to 24 in spain in 1982 , and to 32 in france in 1998 , will now feature 36 teams from all five continents .
a mega event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people will have to look for a job in 2006 thanks to the world cup with the world cup being the most popular tv event in the world and a global brand name , the tournament could potentially open doors to even more international markets for the hosting country .
according to the dihk study , which was based on a survey of around 20,000 companies , most of the jobs will be created in the areas of hospitality management , advertising , professional security and short-term employment services .
small business is expecting an increase of 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- euros during the world cup .
good news for germany the prediction that the world cup could have a positive impact on the german economy is particularly welcome in view of the new unemployment data published by the federal statistics office on monday .
according to the preliminary statistics for 2005 , the number of employed germans fell by 0.3 percent last year to about 38.7 million .
" the number of employed in 2005 fell , therefore , to roughly the same level as in 2003 , " the office said in a statement released monday .
the overall slight decline in employment , however , does not reveal the extent to which individual economic sectors were hit by recession .
construction , agriculture and manufacturing jobs contracted by 5.0 percent , 2.2 percent and 1.7 percent respectively . manufacturing accounted for 7.885 million , or 20.3 percent of all jobs in germany in 2005 , down from 20.6 percent in 2004 .
the services sector accounted for 27.870 million , or 71.9 percent of employment , up from 71.3 percent in 2004 , the office said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de politicians divided over army deployment for world cup as germany prepares to host the soccer world cup next year , security concerns are looming large .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said . " russian gas has a very good reputation in germany , above all a reputation for being reliable , but one should never forget , from the russian side , what harm one does oneself if one shares responsibility for a dispute , " glos said . he assured german households that they need not fear a mid-winter gas shortage .

" they will not be affected by what has happened so far .
thank god , we have sufficient reserves and we have contracts with many other gas-supplying countries . " russian state-controlled gazprom announced that it was cutting off supplies to ukraine on sunday because kiev had failed to accept a steep increase in gas prices for 2006 .
on monday , the dispute deepened as gazprom accused ukraine of stealing russian gas from a pipeline transiting its territory that supplies the ukrainian network and western europe .
gazprom to restore supplies gazprom would restore full natural gas supplies to european customers on tuesday , russian news agencies quoted the company 's deputy chairman as saying on monday after several european countries reported shortages .
" we have taken all necessary measures to supply europe with gas according to contracts .
by tomorrow evening , full supply to europe in accordance with these contracts will be restored , " alexander medvedev , who is also gazprom 's export chief , said at a news conference .
german gas companies reported disruptions to their supplies . " we are clearly receiving less than foreseen in our contract but we can not yet specify how much , " an e.on ruhrgas spokeswoman said , as wingas also reported irregularity in its supply from russia .
fine for now the spokeswoman said e.on ruhrgas had been able to compensate for the reduction in supply " without a problem " but that if the disruption continued , the company would increase its imports from other countries .
the company is germany 's largest gas importer with a 60 percent share of the market and holds a 6.5 percent stake in russian energy giant gazprom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's gas supply has been disrupted a spokesman for wingas , a 50-50 joint venture between gazprom and german group wintershall , said the company was also unable to quantify the dip in its russian gas supply .
the company said in a statement that it saw no risk of a supply crunch for its customers . germany imports 84 percent of its gas and russia is its chief supplier .
but it also has flexible gas contracts with several other countries , including norway and the netherlands , and sufficient gas reserves to last 75 days . e.on ruhrgas had said on sunday that it foresaw no immediate danger of german households being affected , but warned that if " the restrictions were to go beyond a certain level , and the winter turns out to be particularly severe , our ability to compensate for the disruptions could reach its limits .

he said that nuclear power and coal could be alternatives .
germany 's nuclear power plants were " sentenced to be shut down for political reasons " by the previous social democratic-green party governing coalition , he added . but glos stressed he did n't want to incite an argument among the governing coalition .
the christian democrats and their bavarian sister party , to which glos belongs , were at odds with the social democrats over the issue during their talks to form a coalition in november .
glos ' side had recommended allowing nuclear power plants to run beyond the 2020 deadline by which they are all supposed to be shut down .
political repercussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has repeatedly spoken out in favor of nuclear power in the ongoing dispute over natural gas prices between russia and ukraine , glos said he foresaw no immediate fallout for german consumers , but warned moscow that the crisis could have political repercussions .
he said that since russia held the presidency of the g8 " it should behave in a responsible manner . "
russia , which supplies 36 percent of germany 's gas needs , should also bear in mind that the dispute will affect its reputation as a stable supplier , he said .

the complex is the best maintained example of third reich architecture in germany , and since jan .
1 it 's open to the public . since the us army occupied burg vogelsang , one of the nazi 's four elite schools , in 1945 hardly a civilian has had a chance to see it .
british and later belgian soldiers used the building and its 33-square meter -lrb- 21-square mile -rrb- exercise grounds for training .

hikers can take advantage of tours of the park or strike out on their own along the 50 kilometers of paths through grasslands , meadows and forests .
however , leaving the paths is strictly forbidden as live ammunition could still be lying around after decades of military use . burg vogelsang , an imposing complex of dozens of buildings perched above lake urft , was built between 1934 and 1936 by cologne architect clemens klotz as a training center for the nazi leaders of the future .
young men attended classes there between 1936 and 1939 , until they were sent home at the start of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 new law in norway gives businesswomen a boost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting jan .
1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

" despite everything , i love yemen , " said chrobog . the five were released saturday after security forces backed by army solders laid siege to the kidnappers ' hideout in the small village of al-saeed and seized four hostage-takers . accusations of carelessness it was the fourth abduction of foreign tourists in yemen this year .
two austrians were freed in december after being held for three days . chrobog said " he would never put himself or his family at risk during a vacation . " he also rejected the accusations that he and his family were careless about where they wanted to spend their vacations . " that is absolutely grotesque .
i would never go to iraq or afghanistan , or look at the prehistoric cities in columbia , " he said . tribal dispute bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a red circle around the location where the chrobog family was taken hostage the family was seized by tribesmen who reportedly sought to use them as bargaining chips in a tribal vendetta .
they were abducted from a restaurant on the road between the port city of aden and shabwa , which lies 480 kilometers -lrb- 300 miles -rrb- east of the capital sanaa . " we were worried during the first few hours after we were kidnapped .
but the kidnappers told us they were not terrorists , " chrobog said , adding that he then felt " reassured . " however , he noted that " during our time in captivity , we saw some children of the tribe were carrying guns when they should have been at school .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 new law in norway gives businesswomen a boost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting jan .
1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

" yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : fueling europe with russian gas moscow , kiev reach breakthrough in gas pricing row opinion : gas dispute undermines russian foreign policy press review : " the 21st century 's first declaration of war " gas dispute reignites atomic energy debate europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 gas delivery dispute hits eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas measuring station reported a decrease in flow because of a dispute between russian gas supplier gazprom and ukraine , gas deliveries to some eastern european union countries fell over the new year 's weekend . russian gas deliveries to hungary , poland and austria via ukraine fell sharply sunday even though the russians assured eu officials that their countries would not be affected by the ongoing dispute with ukraine over gas supplies .
the russian state monopoly , gazprom , said sunday that it had cut gas supplies to ukraine after it rejected a new contract quadrupling prices . the cut is exactly the level of ukraine 's own imports .
" as of now , all the gas supplies to ukraine will be reduced to 120 million cubic metres per day , " said sergei kuprianov , spokesperson for the gas giant .
" that means we are only delivering gas to ukraine which is for export to other countries .
we expect ukraine to stick to it ’ s obligation and fulfil it ’ s transit requirements . "
hungarian economic minister janos koka said that gazprom told hungary it is pumping the contracted amount into the pipeline , but reported that the gas did not reach the hungarian-ukrainian border .
" this is not just a hungarian problem , " he told reuters .
" this is a european union problem and the eu will have to be the vehicle for finding the solution . "
heavily dependent hungary is heavily dependent on russian gas - 80 percent of the country 's gas needs are supplied from imports and 70 percent comes from russia .
as a result , hungary 's large gas consumers have been ordered to switch to oil where possible , hungary 's natural gas wholesaler mol told reuters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yushchenko says ukraine entitled to the gas meanwhile , eu leaders are worried as ukraine serves also as a transit country for one-fifth of all gas exports to europe , particularly to germany , italy , france and austria .
so far only hungary , austria and poland have reported decreases in their gas supply : 25 , 18 and 14 percent respectively .
both poland and hungary joined the eu in 2004 .
the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , has called a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the russia-ukraine row . austria , which took over the eu presidency sunday , as well as france , germany and italy have asked russian and ukrainian energy officials that gas supplies " be maintained to their full extent . "
no deal russia and ukraine have been locked in a bitter gas price dispute for months , sparking concerns in european union states that depend heavily on russian energy supplies . kiev has so far been paying 50 dollars per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,316 cubic feet -rrb- of natural gas from russia .
gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's natural gas reserves , wants $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- , arguing that soviet-era tariffs no longer apply and the price needs to be aligned with market rates .
kiev has said it can pay more over a transitional period , but gazprom said it would shut down ukraine 's gas supply from january 1 unless kiev agreed to the higher price immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom says ukraine stealing gas ukrainian prime minister yury yekhanurov said last week that if moscow stopped supplying kiev , his country of 48 million people would have the right to take 15 percent of the gas transiting through its territory to western europe . last-minute diplomatic moves by russian president vladimir putin and ukrainian president viktor yushchenko failed to prevent the stoppage . putin offered to maintain gas supplies at the current price until april but only on condition that a deal be struck by a midnight deadline on new year and that ukraine agree to a more than four-fold price increase thereafter . gazprom said ukraine rejected the deal , though ukrainian officials said late saturday that they were " surprised " by the announcement and that russia had agreed ukraine could pay 50 dollars for the first quarter of 2006 . russia maintains the dispute is purely commercial but ukraine , which was once part of the soviet union but has been increasingly at odds with russian authorities over its firmly pro-west orientation , says that it is under political pressure from moscow . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia reduces gas to ukraine ; says europe not at risk russia began lowering the pressure of natural gas entering ukraine 's pipeline system , a spokesman for the gazprom energy company said sunday , assuring supplies to the rest of europe would remain stable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.01.2006 new law in norway gives businesswomen a boost großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting jan .
1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .

serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .

part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote .

" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .

in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law .

1 , norway 's female executives are getting a leg up thanks to a new quota law , norwegian businesswomen are in greater demand than ever on corporate boards .
but do they need the help ? in norway , a law came into effect on jan .
1 mandating that at least 40 percent of the seats on the boards of norway 's publicly listed companies must be held by women .
the new center-left government is threatening to dissolve any company that does n't comply . already in norway , all employers have a duty to actively promote gender equality and to report annually on how they do it .
however , the former center-right government decided to go further and proposed legislation to ensure more equality in positions at the very top . the confederation of norwegian enterprise , an umbrella organization for the country 's employers , say they have been working to increase female board representation ever since the law was proposed . among the group 's members , the percentage of women on corporate boards has risen from 6 to 21 percent in the past three years . bleak picture in eu elsewhere in europe , women have had little success reaching the upper echelons of business .
according to 1999 data from the international labor organization , only 5.1 percent of executive management positions in the top 500 us companies were held by women , whereas in france this number was 4.7 percent , compared to 3.6 percent in britain and just three percent in germany . the ranks get even thinner when it comes to board seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karin dorrepaal , member of schering 's board karin dorrepaal recently made waves when she was elected to the board of german pharmaceutical firm schering , the first woman on the board of one of germany 's 30 biggest companies . no flood of corporate female appointments has followed , however , and none is expected .
neither germany nor the european union is expected to pass a quota regulation like norway 's anytime soon , opting instead for government directives and a push for something called " gender mainstreaming . " yet in germany , the only place women have had success nearly equal to men is in politics - a change that many say can be directly traced to the implementation of a quota system that went into effect in the 1980s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : quotas did n't hurt merkel 's chances of making it to the top today , germany boasts a female chancellor .
and norway - which is not an eu member state - is undertaking a unique experiment . karita bekkemellem , norway 's minister responsible for gender equality , said she believes such a law is the only way forward .
serious consequences " women in norway have a good education , they can go in to do a very good job , and this will be very important for the decisions companies in norway make in the future , " bekkemellem said .
some business representatives have said they find it hard to believe the law will be strictly enforced , i.e. , that companies will actually be dissolved in the case of noncompliance . but bekkemellem said the government sees the issue as a " serious question . " a question of competence under the new laws , the listed companies would have up to four years to comply . meanwhile , the confederation of norwegian enterprise has come out against the law .
but sigrun vageng , responsible for labor politics at the confederation , admits the politicians have at least set the ball rolling when it comes to long-term change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the male-dominated oil industry is a large part of norway 's economy " i think the discussion started by the politicians was important , i have to give them that , " vageng said . " i think one of the reasons we have been successful up until now is that norwegian companies see that this is not a question of being man or woman , it 's a question of competence , " she said .
part of the problem is norway 's size , said elin orjaseter , a leading norwegian headhunter .
in her experience , top companies in a country of only 4.5 million people ca n't afford to take gender into account if they want to stay in competition . " i do n't think the government really knows how to put together a really good board , " orjaseter said . should other groups be included ? not only does she oppose the law , she is against the very idea of gender quotas , and questions the idea diversity quotas are meant to promote . " white norwegian , heterosexual women are one of the big majorities in norwegian work life , orjaseter said .
" so if diversity was a point , i think other groups are more important to have on the boards .
why not homosexuals , ethnic minorities , why not muslims ? why us big , wealthy , white norwegian women ? "
in norway , the male-dominated oil industry is a mainstay of the country 's robust economy , and its representatives are resistant to the new law . " i would not like to see women coming into my board where there is a clear suspicion they are there because of a legal framework and not because of their competence , " said eivind reiten , ceo of norway 's second largest oil-producing company , norsk hydro . lars bevanger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu takes slow road to gender equity an ongoing eu push for gender equality aims to help women improve their lot in european society .

today , it 's not unusual to see women in uniform serving in the bundeswehr 's missions abroad . though their numbers still are n't many , at least the 11,800 women in uniform today are no longer stared at like some rare species in a zoo .
for the pioneer women soldiers who joined the bundeswehr in 2001 , it was a different story . " the first thing i heard was men whispering and saying , ' what 's she doing here , she must have taken a wrong turn . '
and i just said , ' no , i belong here , and i 'm doing the training together with all of you ' , " one female recruit remembered of her introduction to military life . the bundeswehr did n't voluntarily open its doors to women .
it took a case brought before the european court of justice in 2000 by tanja kreil .
a trained electrician , kreil felt discriminated against when her application to the bundeswehr was rejected not because of her qualifications , but because of her gender .
on jan .
11 , 2000 , the judges agreed with kreil - a decision welcomed by those german women for whom the dream of joining the army had become a real possibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr has been open to women since 2001 " it 's just the whole environment , the camaraderie , the physicality and the whole training , " said one of germany 's first female soldiers , who declined to be named .
" it always fascinated me , even as a small child , and it was always a dream of mine to join the army . " following the ruling , the german government had to change the country 's basic law , which , in article 12 , expressly forbad women from armed service . breaking up the boys ' club during the first two decades of its existence , the bundeswehr , which was established in 1955 , was exclusively a boys ' club .
starting in 1975 , women were permitted to serve only in medical units or musical bands . but after winning the right to serve in fighting units alongside men , 244 women joined the bundeswehr in january 2001 - on a voluntary basis .
compulsory military service for women is still prohibited by law . five years ago , a new era of change began for the bundeswehr , from logistical adjustments such as separate barracks and facilities for women , to behavioral adjustments in the way male training officers deal with their female charges . female soldiers generally agree that they do n't want any special treatment , but especially in the beginning , cases of sexual harassment by male training officers or male recruits did crop up .
bundeswehr officials made sure that offenders were strictly punished , and ran special seminars for officers on preventing sexual harassment . today , women make up 6 percent of bundeswehr soldiers .
it will probably take another five years before a woman can become a company commander , and another 15 years before an entire battalion will be commanded by a woman .
german army officials recognize that they 've not yet exhausted the kind of contributions women can make to the bundeswehr .
serving as an example of that are the 300 women currently taking part in foreign missions - something that was considered unthinkable only a few short years ago . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : 50 years of the bundeswehr the german army , or bundeswehr , has gone through many changes and has faced many diverse challenges since its formation in 1955 .

salzburg , the city of his birth , is hoping to cash in with a mixture of kitsch and high culture and its mozart industry is going into overdrive this month .
an enterprising local dairy has developed a new mozart yogurt and a mozart dessert drink - flavoured with chocolate , hazelnut and marzipan .
the yogurt is one of hundreds of new products being developed for the composer 's 250th birthday on 27 january .
as well as yogurt , you can buy mozart sausage , mozart baby bottles and mozart perfume .
traders here are hoping for a bumper year .
some austrians think it all too much , including kurt palm , himself the author of a new book about mozart .
" the new slogan for 2006 is not sex sells , but mozart sells .
if mozart could see what happens now only in austria , in vienna or salzburg this year , he would either only laugh about it or he would be disgusted , " he says .
but for salzburg , mozart-marketing and tourism brings in the money .
the city 's mayor heinz schaden says the composer is one of the city 's most important sources of income .
" it 's probably difficult to calculate it in euros but if you make an opinion poll with all the tourists who come to salzburg , many would say i want to see the city where wolfgang amadeus mozart was born .
salzburg is hard to imagine without mozart .
he put this city on the map . "
' exciting ' but amidst the kitsch , salzburg has not forgotten what really matters about mozart : his music .
this summer there will be a chance to see every opera that mozart wrote .
for the first time , the famous salzburg festival is staging all 22 operas in five weeks .
suzanne staehr from the salzburg festival says it is a huge logistical and artistic challenge .
" normally we show five or six operas in a festival season .
next season we will show 22 operas .
but when should this experiment be done except in the anniversary year - and where else but salzburg ?
the city of his birth takes on this challenge , " she says .
world-famous musicians and conductors will be performing mozart including simon rattle , nikolaus harnoncourt and riccardo muti .
it is a prospect that even excites jaded salzburgers .
" for real mozartians there can never be too much mozart and in any case there is going to be a lot of mozart , we perhaps have n't heard so much before and that 's going to be exciting , discovering the undiscovered mozart , " a shopper in central salzburg says .
" mozart is a very famous citizen of salzburg and we are proud to have him and we enjoy celebrating his 250th birthday , " says a local civil servant .
" we hope many people come to salzburg - the more often they come the better it is for us . "
in the ice rink in salzburg 's mozart square , there is even the chance to go skating to the strains of the queen of the night aria from the magic flute .
all this mozart may be too much for some people , but salzburgers know when they are on to a good thing .

the city 's mayor heinz schaden says the composer is one of the city 's most important sources of income .

' exciting ' but amidst the kitsch , salzburg has not forgotten what really matters about mozart : his music .
this summer there will be a chance to see every opera that mozart wrote .
for the first time , the famous salzburg festival is staging all 22 operas in five weeks .
all mozart 's operas will be performed for the anniversary suzanne staehr from the salzburg festival says it is a huge logistical and artistic challenge .
" normally we show five or six operas in a festival season .
next season we will show 22 operas .
but when should this experiment be done except in the anniversary year - and where else but salzburg ?
the city of his birth takes on this challenge , " she says .
world-famous musicians and conductors will be performing mozart including simon rattle , nikolaus harnoncourt and riccardo muti .
it is a prospect that even excites jaded salzburgers .
" for real mozartians there can never be too much mozart and in any case there is going to be a lot of mozart , we perhaps have n't heard so much before and that 's going to be exciting , discovering the undiscovered mozart , " a shopper in central salzburg says .
" mozart is a very famous citizen of salzburg and we are proud to have him and we enjoy celebrating his 250th birthday , " says a local civil servant .
" we hope many people come to salzburg - the more often they come the better it is for us . "
in the ice rink in salzburg 's mozart square , there is even the chance to go skating to the strains of the queen of the night aria from the magic flute .
