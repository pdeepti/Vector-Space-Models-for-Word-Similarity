11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .

we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .
the british government maintains that legislation and extended powers have contributed to making britain safer .
human rights and civil liberty groups continue to ask if the restriction of freedom in the uk is still too high a price to pay for security while a recent icm / guardian-backed survey found that 73 percent of brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the level of risk is not a fiction , it 's a reality " the british government has put its faith in anti-terrorism legislation since 9/11 .
lord carlile of berriew , the independent reviewer of terror legislation , talked to dw-world.de about fighting terror with the law .

2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .

the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .

he has said that he can imagine a coalition between his left-wing party and topolanek 's civic democratic party - but without topolanek as prime minister . the social democrats , which had headed the czech government for eight years , privatized the banking sector and oversaw the country 's accession to both nato and the european union . corruption allegations tarnished the party 's reputation and allowed the civic democrats to prevail in june . with only 14 members , the new cabinet is the smallest in the country 's history . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs search for burial site for 4,300 german war dead the czech army has removed cardboard coffins with the remains of 4,300 german soldiers and civilians killed in world war ii from a disused factory where they had been kept while awaiting a final resting place .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .
art has the freedom to interpret this . " he announced the film version at the venice film festival friday just before the premiere of stephen frears ' " the queen , " a full-length feature about queen elizabeth 's reaction to diana 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief is used to controversy already , the planned movie is creating a buzz because of schlingensief 's choice of jenny elvers-elbertzhagen to portray the princess .
she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .

beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .

11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

" the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .
" that is the bottom line of this policy .

11 : security versus civil liberties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since sept .
11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .
new extraditio n laws will be i n troduced ; n ew rules to e n sure asylum is n ot a fro n t for terrorist e n try .
this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .
the british government maintains that legislation and extended powers have contributed to making britain safer .
human rights and civil liberty groups continue to ask if the restriction of freedom in the uk is still too high a price to pay for security while a recent icm / guardian-backed survey found that 73 percent of brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the level of risk is not a fiction , it 's a reality " the british government has put its faith in anti-terrorism legislation since 9/11 .
lord carlile of berriew , the independent reviewer of terror legislation , talked to dw-world.de about fighting terror with the law .
" terror events should n't undermine our democratic values " the british government 's response to the increased terror threat with more stringent legislation has been criticized by civil liberty groups .

it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .

the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .

11 : security versus civil liberties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since sept .
11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .
new extraditio n laws will be i n troduced ; n ew rules to e n sure asylum is n ot a fro n t for terrorist e n try .
this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .

" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation . " home ownership rates wo n't skyrocket , but they 'll go up , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .

five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .
" that is the bottom line of this policy . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : deficit-sinner germany mending its ways germany may manage this year to keep its deficit down to the level required by the eu stability pact , which underpins the euro .

but with an impending vote of confidence for the minority party and possible early elections , uncertainty remains . the political scene in the czech republic has been deadlocked since june elections split the left-right parliamentary divide straight down the middle , with 100 seats each . a new conservative cabinet was finally appointed monday by president vaclav klaus , who said the new government guaranteed that the czech republic 's direction would stay the same . indeed , recent instability is expected to remain as the hallmark of czech politics in the foreseeable future . vote of co n fide n ce by oct .

allegations that paroubek had connections to organized crime , which came days before the parliamentary elections , have left him seething . paroubek , the social democratic party leader , has since been unwilling to negotiate with the right-wing parties on creating a new coalition government .
he has said that he can imagine a coalition between his left-wing party and topolanek 's civic democratic party - but without topolanek as prime minister . the social democrats , which had headed the czech government for eight years , privatized the banking sector and oversaw the country 's accession to both nato and the european union . corruption allegations tarnished the party 's reputation and allowed the civic democrats to prevail in june . with only 14 members , the new cabinet is the smallest in the country 's history . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs search for burial site for 4,300 german war dead the czech army has removed cardboard coffins with the remains of 4,300 german soldiers and civilians killed in world war ii from a disused factory where they had been kept while awaiting a final resting place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 lebanon signals delay in requesting german troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy may face a limited mandate for patrolling lebanon 's coast the lebanese government has set preconditions for the deployment of a german naval peacekeeping force , saying israel must first lift its air and sea blockade . confusion gave way to frustration in berlin on tuesday as government officials tried to make sense of the latest news from beirut . the office of prime minister fuad siniora said earlier in the day that the lebanese government had decided to approve the deployment of a german naval force to secure the lebanese coast as part of a un-led peacekeeping force .
the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 lebanon signals delay in requesting german troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german navy may face a limited mandate for patrolling lebanon 's coast the lebanese government has set preconditions for the deployment of a german naval peacekeeping force , saying israel must first lift its air and sea blockade . confusion gave way to frustration in berlin on tuesday as government officials tried to make sense of the latest news from beirut . the office of prime minister fuad siniora said earlier in the day that the lebanese government had decided to approve the deployment of a german naval force to secure the lebanese coast as part of a un-led peacekeeping force .
the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .
art has the freedom to interpret this . " he announced the film version at the venice film festival friday just before the premiere of stephen frears ' " the queen , " a full-length feature about queen elizabeth 's reaction to diana 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief is used to controversy already , the planned movie is creating a buzz because of schlingensief 's choice of jenny elvers-elbertzhagen to portray the princess .
she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface . " as the son of a pharmacist , i knew my father poisoned his customers with small doses , " he told bloomberg .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

the 10-year contract will create 1,000 jobs , the paper said . britain 's department of health had opened bidding for the contract and several big european logistics firms had applied for it .
deutsche post 's clinching of the contract is largely seen to be a result of its close links with british logistics company exel , which is a leader in britain in the field of supplying products and services . the previously state-owned deutsche post bought exel last years for a sum of 5.5 billion euros . " a co n vi n ci n g offer " klaus zumwinkel , ceo of deutsche post said the nhs contract marked a significant success for the group 's strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl is spreading its wings " after the take-over of exel and given dhl 's extensive expertise in the health sector , we were able to make our customer a truly convincing offer , " zumwinkel said .
" we now reap the benefits of both our internationalization strategy and our broad product range . " zumwinkel added that deutsche post 's logistics subsidiary , dhl will in future operate a segment in britain under the name of nhs supply chain , which will take over procurement and logistics services for half a million products in the public health sector . the products include food , bed linen , office equipment , stationery , cleaning products , patient clothing , medical and surgical equipment . in 2008 , dhl will also open a new britain-based distribution center to act as a stockholding hub for food and other products .
an extra 1,000 employees are expected to be recruited to manage it .
the nhs supply chain is meant to help britain 's department of health to save up to 1.4 billion euros . a wi n -wi n situatio n john allan , ceo of dhl 's logistics division and a member of the deutsche post management board , said the contract was a win-win situation . " this contract is both good for staff and good for the nhs , " allan said .

the 10-year contract will create 1,000 jobs , the paper said . britain 's department of health had opened bidding for the contract and several big european logistics firms had applied for it .
deutsche post 's clinching of the contract is largely seen to be a result of its close links with british logistics company exel , which is a leader in britain in the field of supplying products and services . the previously state-owned deutsche post bought exel last years for a sum of 5.5 billion euros . " a co n vi n ci n g offer " klaus zumwinkel , ceo of deutsche post said the nhs contract marked a significant success for the group 's strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl is spreading its wings " after the take-over of exel and given dhl 's extensive expertise in the health sector , we were able to make our customer a truly convincing offer , " zumwinkel said .
" we now reap the benefits of both our internationalization strategy and our broad product range . " zumwinkel added that deutsche post 's logistics subsidiary , dhl will in future operate a segment in britain under the name of nhs supply chain , which will take over procurement and logistics services for half a million products in the public health sector . the products include food , bed linen , office equipment , stationery , cleaning products , patient clothing , medical and surgical equipment . in 2008 , dhl will also open a new britain-based distribution center to act as a stockholding hub for food and other products .
an extra 1,000 employees are expected to be recruited to manage it .
the nhs supply chain is meant to help britain 's department of health to save up to 1.4 billion euros . a wi n -wi n situatio n john allan , ceo of dhl 's logistics division and a member of the deutsche post management board , said the contract was a win-win situation . " this contract is both good for staff and good for the nhs , " allan said .
" we are thrilled to play such a major part in this change to manage and deliver a world-class supply chain for the nhs .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .

this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .
the british government maintains that legislation and extended powers have contributed to making britain safer .
human rights and civil liberty groups continue to ask if the restriction of freedom in the uk is still too high a price to pay for security while a recent icm / guardian-backed survey found that 73 percent of brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the level of risk is not a fiction , it 's a reality " the british government has put its faith in anti-terrorism legislation since 9/11 .
lord carlile of berriew , the independent reviewer of terror legislation , talked to dw-world.de about fighting terror with the law .

washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .

as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .

11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .

it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .

11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .

this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation . " home ownership rates wo n't skyrocket , but they 'll go up , " he said . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deconstructing germany due to a weak economy , falling birthrates and higher numbers of people relocating to find jobs , some german regions are losing population ; their cities are shrinking .

but with an impending vote of confidence for the minority party and possible early elections , uncertainty remains . the political scene in the czech republic has been deadlocked since june elections split the left-right parliamentary divide straight down the middle , with 100 seats each . a new conservative cabinet was finally appointed monday by president vaclav klaus , who said the new government guaranteed that the czech republic 's direction would stay the same . indeed , recent instability is expected to remain as the hallmark of czech politics in the foreseeable future . vote of co n fide n ce by oct .

his party is widely expected to lose the vote , which could lead to early elections . rival prime mi n isters topolanek 's biggest rival is former prime minister jiri paroubek , who was voted out in june .
allegations that paroubek had connections to organized crime , which came days before the parliamentary elections , have left him seething . paroubek , the social democratic party leader , has since been unwilling to negotiate with the right-wing parties on creating a new coalition government .
he has said that he can imagine a coalition between his left-wing party and topolanek 's civic democratic party - but without topolanek as prime minister . the social democrats , which had headed the czech government for eight years , privatized the banking sector and oversaw the country 's accession to both nato and the european union . corruption allegations tarnished the party 's reputation and allowed the civic democrats to prevail in june . with only 14 members , the new cabinet is the smallest in the country 's history . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs search for burial site for 4,300 german war dead the czech army has removed cardboard coffins with the remains of 4,300 german soldiers and civilians killed in world war ii from a disused factory where they had been kept while awaiting a final resting place .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .
art has the freedom to interpret this . " he announced the film version at the venice film festival friday just before the premiere of stephen frears ' " the queen , " a full-length feature about queen elizabeth 's reaction to diana 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief is used to controversy already , the planned movie is creating a buzz because of schlingensief 's choice of jenny elvers-elbertzhagen to portray the princess .
she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

but with an impending vote of confidence for the minority party and possible early elections , uncertainty remains . the political scene in the czech republic has been deadlocked since june elections split the left-right parliamentary divide straight down the middle , with 100 seats each . a new conservative cabinet was finally appointed monday by president vaclav klaus , who said the new government guaranteed that the czech republic 's direction would stay the same . indeed , recent instability is expected to remain as the hallmark of czech politics in the foreseeable future . vote of co n fide n ce by oct .

his party is widely expected to lose the vote , which could lead to early elections . rival prime mi n isters topolanek 's biggest rival is former prime minister jiri paroubek , who was voted out in june .
allegations that paroubek had connections to organized crime , which came days before the parliamentary elections , have left him seething . paroubek , the social democratic party leader , has since been unwilling to negotiate with the right-wing parties on creating a new coalition government .
he has said that he can imagine a coalition between his left-wing party and topolanek 's civic democratic party - but without topolanek as prime minister . the social democrats , which had headed the czech government for eight years , privatized the banking sector and oversaw the country 's accession to both nato and the european union . corruption allegations tarnished the party 's reputation and allowed the civic democrats to prevail in june . with only 14 members , the new cabinet is the smallest in the country 's history . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs search for burial site for 4,300 german war dead the czech army has removed cardboard coffins with the remains of 4,300 german soldiers and civilians killed in world war ii from a disused factory where they had been kept while awaiting a final resting place .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the 10-year contract will create 1,000 jobs , the paper said . britain 's department of health had opened bidding for the contract and several big european logistics firms had applied for it .
deutsche post 's clinching of the contract is largely seen to be a result of its close links with british logistics company exel , which is a leader in britain in the field of supplying products and services . the previously state-owned deutsche post bought exel last years for a sum of 5.5 billion euros . " a co n vi n ci n g offer " klaus zumwinkel , ceo of deutsche post said the nhs contract marked a significant success for the group 's strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl is spreading its wings " after the take-over of exel and given dhl 's extensive expertise in the health sector , we were able to make our customer a truly convincing offer , " zumwinkel said .
" we now reap the benefits of both our internationalization strategy and our broad product range . " zumwinkel added that deutsche post 's logistics subsidiary , dhl will in future operate a segment in britain under the name of nhs supply chain , which will take over procurement and logistics services for half a million products in the public health sector . the products include food , bed linen , office equipment , stationery , cleaning products , patient clothing , medical and surgical equipment . in 2008 , dhl will also open a new britain-based distribution center to act as a stockholding hub for food and other products .
an extra 1,000 employees are expected to be recruited to manage it .
the nhs supply chain is meant to help britain 's department of health to save up to 1.4 billion euros . a wi n -wi n situatio n john allan , ceo of dhl 's logistics division and a member of the deutsche post management board , said the contract was a win-win situation . " this contract is both good for staff and good for the nhs , " allan said .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .

five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .

11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .

the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .

she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .

she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax .

11 : security versus civil liberties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since sept .
11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .
new extraditio n laws will be i n troduced ; n ew rules to e n sure asylum is n ot a fro n t for terrorist e n try .
this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .
the british government maintains that legislation and extended powers have contributed to making britain safer .
human rights and civil liberty groups continue to ask if the restriction of freedom in the uk is still too high a price to pay for security while a recent icm / guardian-backed survey found that 73 percent of brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the level of risk is not a fiction , it 's a reality " the british government has put its faith in anti-terrorism legislation since 9/11 .
lord carlile of berriew , the independent reviewer of terror legislation , talked to dw-world.de about fighting terror with the law .
" terror events should n't undermine our democratic values " the british government 's response to the increased terror threat with more stringent legislation has been criticized by civil liberty groups .

2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .
the new prevention of terrorism act was presented to parliament in february 2005 . building on the restrictions of the atcsa and constructed in such a way as to avoid a second defeat by the law lords , the act was brought in to give the home secretary , then charles clarke , even stronger powers in regard to detention of suspects . i n creased powers provoke criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : charles clarke -lrb- r . -rrb- and police commissioner ian blair the act allowed clarke to issue " control orders " for people he suspected of involvement in terrorism , including placing them under house arrest , restricting their access to mobile telephones and the internet and requiring that visitors be named in advance so that they may be vetted by the secret services . the act faced substantial opposition and was amended a number of times before being adopted with a " sunset " clause that it would be reviewed in a year .
-lrb- in february 2006 , the home secretary announced that a review was unnecessary at the time and postponed it until 2007 . -rrb- blair defended the prevention of terrorism act by arguing that protecting the country from terrorism was the single most important role of government , and that everything else , including preserving the tradition of individual liberty , was secondary . despite the increased security and regulations , terrorists attacked london on july 7 , 2005 , killing 52 people and injuring over 700 in four suicide bombings on the capital 's transport system . lo n do n attacks lead to n ew laws the threat was now very real to britain .
it had devastating evidence that it was not immune to terrorist attack and as a consequence , heightened security and legislation were once more advocated .
as a result , the highly controversial terrorism act 2006 came into being . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair wants terror suspects to be detained for 90 days the act created new offenses related to terrorism , including the condoning or glorifying of terrorism , and amended existing ones .
the most controversial part was the increase in detention without trial to 90 days from 14 as stipulated in the terrorism act 2000 .
this brought about tony blair 's first defeat on the floor of the house of commons and the detention limit was set at 28 days , a ruling which came into force on july 25 , 2006 . british counterterrorism officials claim to have foiled a dozen or so attacks since sept .
11 - four of them just in the past year .
the british government maintains that legislation and extended powers have contributed to making britain safer .
human rights and civil liberty groups continue to ask if the restriction of freedom in the uk is still too high a price to pay for security while a recent icm / guardian-backed survey found that 73 percent of brits would happily hand over their civil liberties in exchange for better security against terrorist attacks . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the level of risk is not a fiction , it 's a reality " the british government has put its faith in anti-terrorism legislation since 9/11 .

11 , britain has seen a sharp increase in terror alerts and tougher laws in the five years since the sept.11 , 2001 terror attacks on the us , britain has itself become both a victim of terror and the legislation brought in to secure it from further attacks . " here i n this cou n try a n d i n other n atio n s rou n d the world , laws will be cha n ged , n ot to de n y basic liberties but to preve n t their abuse a n d protect the most basic liberty of all : freedom from terror .

this cou n try is proud of its traditio n i n givi n g asylum to those fleei n g tyra n n y .
we will always do so .
but we have a duty to protect the system from abuse .
it must be overhauled radically so that from n ow o n , those who abide by the rules get help a n d those that do n ' t , ca n n o lo n ger play the system to gai n u n fair adva n tage over others . " - british prime mi n ister to n y blair at the labour party co n fere n ce , oct .
2 , 2001 . in the wake of the sept.11 terrorist attacks on the united states , tony blair pledged on the behalf of britain to fight " shoulder to shoulder " with its trans-atlantic ally in its newly proclaimed " war on terror . "
while committing troops to the us-led campaign against al qaeda and its taliban supporters in afghanistan , blair began another battle on the domestic front : securing britain and soothing the fears of a rattled nation . both the us and britain saw a flurry of legislation aimed at improving security after sept.11.
washington brought in the draconian patriot act and in the uk , the labour party introduced the anti-terrorism , crime and security act -lrb- atcsa -rrb- in 2001 . the atcsa gave the then home secretary david blunkett power to " certify " individuals as " suspected international terrorists " and to deport or detain indefinitely any non-citizen he " reasonably believed " to be an international terrorist . in the atmosphere of anxiety that engulfed britain immediately after sept .
11 , this was seen as a strengthening of the government 's hand and , as this power had been a long-standing feature of britain 's immigration law and was specifically exempted in article 5 of the 1950 european convention on human rights -lrb- echr -rrb- , it was accepted as being a relatively uncontroversial necessity . the passing of the atcsa meant that for the first time since the end of world war ii , the british government had the power to detain a suspect indefinitely without charge , and , crucially , without the detainee having the opportunity of answering the evidence by which the detention was justified .
the government argued that to present the evidence in open court would be a threat to national security and the on-going work of the intelligence services . madrid attacks i n creased fear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tremors from madrid were felt strongly in britain europe 's worst terror attack to date , the devastating attacks on madrid on march 11 , 2004 which claimed 192 lives and injured 2,050 , rocked the continent .
the shockwaves were especially strong in britain .
the attacks in spain were held up as evidence of a flawed policy in iraq and the wider fight against terrorism by those in opposition to the war .
in britain , along with spain a main supporter in both , fear of retribution on home soil heightened . the attacks in madrid called for more action in the uk .
after being defeated by the law lords , the judicial section of the house of lords who , in december 2004 , ruled that the detention of nine terrorism suspects held without charge under the atcsa was unlawful and against the echr , blair reacted with the introduction of more anti-terror measures .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

" almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .
" that is the bottom line of this policy .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

the 10-year contract will create 1,000 jobs , the paper said . britain 's department of health had opened bidding for the contract and several big european logistics firms had applied for it .
deutsche post 's clinching of the contract is largely seen to be a result of its close links with british logistics company exel , which is a leader in britain in the field of supplying products and services . the previously state-owned deutsche post bought exel last years for a sum of 5.5 billion euros . " a co n vi n ci n g offer " klaus zumwinkel , ceo of deutsche post said the nhs contract marked a significant success for the group 's strategy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dhl is spreading its wings " after the take-over of exel and given dhl 's extensive expertise in the health sector , we were able to make our customer a truly convincing offer , " zumwinkel said .
" we now reap the benefits of both our internationalization strategy and our broad product range . " zumwinkel added that deutsche post 's logistics subsidiary , dhl will in future operate a segment in britain under the name of nhs supply chain , which will take over procurement and logistics services for half a million products in the public health sector . the products include food , bed linen , office equipment , stationery , cleaning products , patient clothing , medical and surgical equipment . in 2008 , dhl will also open a new britain-based distribution center to act as a stockholding hub for food and other products .
an extra 1,000 employees are expected to be recruited to manage it .
the nhs supply chain is meant to help britain 's department of health to save up to 1.4 billion euros . a wi n -wi n situatio n john allan , ceo of dhl 's logistics division and a member of the deutsche post management board , said the contract was a win-win situation . " this contract is both good for staff and good for the nhs , " allan said .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

the 10-year contract will create 1,000 jobs , the paper said . britain 's department of health had opened bidding for the contract and several big european logistics firms had applied for it .
deutsche post 's clinching of the contract is largely seen to be a result of its close links with british logistics company exel , which is a leader in britain in the field of supplying products and services . the previously state-owned deutsche post bought exel last years for a sum of 5.5 billion euros .

" zumwinkel added that deutsche post 's logistics subsidiary , dhl will in future operate a segment in britain under the name of nhs supply chain , which will take over procurement and logistics services for half a million products in the public health sector . the products include food , bed linen , office equipment , stationery , cleaning products , patient clothing , medical and surgical equipment . in 2008 , dhl will also open a new britain-based distribution center to act as a stockholding hub for food and other products .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .

there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.09.2006 berlin breaks ground on new international airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor and brandenburg 's premier -lrb- second and third from left -rrb- dug in the spades after years of delay , a ground-breaking ceremony for berlin brandenburg international -lrb- bbi -rrb- airport took place on tuesday .
while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .
art has the freedom to interpret this . " he announced the film version at the venice film festival friday just before the premiere of stephen frears ' " the queen , " a full-length feature about queen elizabeth 's reaction to diana 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief is used to controversy already , the planned movie is creating a buzz because of schlingensief 's choice of jenny elvers-elbertzhagen to portray the princess .
she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface . " as the son of a pharmacist , i knew my father poisoned his customers with small doses , " he told bloomberg .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

while many see bbi as a prestigious project , it still remains highly controversial . people who want to visit berlin have so far had three airports to choose from : the two city airports tegel and tempelhof as well as schönefeld , in the southeastern corner of the capital . by oct .
2011 , there will only be one left : the main airport berlin brandenburg international , bbi , which will be constructed on a 1,470-hectar -lrb- 3,632-acre -rrb- site next to schönefeld , once the airport of east berlin . the government is proud of its new baby , but it will cost german tax payers about 2.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- after all attempts failed to find private investors . according to berlin mayor klaus wowereit , however , this will be the money well spent . " berlin is an international metropolis , the capital of one of the biggest countries in europe and of course it has to have something that stands out from the rest , and that is always an airport , " wowereit said .
" it 's not going to be a marble palace and it 's not going to be a wooden shack .
what we will build is a solid , functional airport which will also be very appealing architecturally . " improveme n ts o n the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans who live near the future construction site were opposed to the new aiport a lot of things are supposed to improve : much more space for passengers at check-ins , state-of-the-art security technology and fast transport connections to the city center .
the airport is also expected to provide an economic stimulus and offer additional 40,000 jobs for the financially struggling region . the supporters of the airport have come a long way : bbi should have been finished by the end of this year , but breakdowns and massive protests delayed the start of construction for years . some 4,000 residents instigated legal actions , complaining about the expected increased in noise levels .
after a lengthy legal battle , however , the federal administrative court decided in march to give the airport the go-ahead .
the only consolation for residents is that there will be stricter noise regulations . no more low-cost ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current plans call for the closing of berlin 's tempelhof airport the airport will have two runaways and a single terminal building .
but european low-cost airlines , who are nowadays flying to and from berlin 's schönefeld airport , have criticized bbi as a project whose design and infrastructure were biased towards traditional carriers like lufthansa . " the idea to dispatch low-cost and traditional carriers under one roof is simply absurd , " said john hanlon , secretary general of the european low fares airline association -lrb- eflaa -rrb- .
" berlin would ignore the fundamental trend in european air traffic . " eflaa is worried that low-cost airlines will not be able to compete if their profits are eroded by high costs of operating from bbi . but berlin 's mayor , who is facing re-election on sept .
17 , defended the plans . " we ca n't build the airport to cater to the needs of individual carriers , " wowereit said . many experts have cautioned that bbi fans ' dream of it becoming a big international hub wo n't come true .
berlin has arrived on the scene simply too late to pose a serious competitive threat to london 's heathrow or paris ' charles de gaulle . another fact is that initially only 22 to 25 million passengers will be able to pass through the new airport per year , only half the number already processed by germany 's biggest airport in frankfurt . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade . " renters should seriously look at the chance to own the four walls , especially in terms of old-age security , because if they do n't , they face the risk of a new landlord , who would have the right to move in himself , " beyerle said . demographic shifts i n flue n ce re n tal market real estate experts also predict that home ownership rates will rise simply because of a shift in demographics , as the war generation , who were mostly renters , dies out .
among middle-aged baby boomers , almost 60 percent are home owners and favor a suburban rowhouse with a garden and white picket fence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many baby boomers want to build , or buy .
among younger adults in their twenties and thirties , stringent lending policies have discouraged home ownership , but that is changing too , said deutsche bank 's just . " in germany , many young people simply can not afford a 30 percent down payment on the purchase price of a home .
in the uk and the netherlands especially , banks are aggressive in targeting a low age group with low equity , offering up to 100 percent financing even , " he said .
" german banks have n't gone that far , but they now are competing to offer more flexible mortgage packages . " differe n t homes for differe n t stages of life though property prices have remained stable in germany , it does n't mean they are cheap , according to bernd katzenstein , spokesman of the german pension institute -lrb- dia -rrb- in cologne . " in the us for example , an average house or flat would cost double or triple the net annual income , but land is so expensive in germany , that the average house costs six times as much , " he said . in addition germans have a different attitude towards home buying than americans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : americans buy and sell their homes ; germans buy and stay put " in the us , a house is a commodity , " he said .
" you buy your first apartment as a single , then sell and buy a bigger one when you are a couple , then upgrade to a house when you have kids , then move to a condo when the kids have left home .
for germans , a house is for life , so they invest their soul and a lot of capital into this one house .
germans have n't learned that houses have re-sale value . " but real estate expert beyerle said the idea of so-called lebe n sabsch n ittsimmobilie n - different homes for a different stage of life - is growing among a younger , more mobile generation .

germans looking to buy those four walls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most germans would like to own their home , but few do more german households rent than own their homes , but that 's changing now with demographic shifts , low mortgage rates , more flexible lending policies and a different attitude towards home ownership . the average purchase price of a renovated , pre-war , two-bedroom condominium in the trendy , former east berlin neighborhood of prenzlauer berg goes for 224,000 euros -lrb- $ 287,000 -rrb- . though steep by berlin standards , the typical 80-square-meter -lrb- 861-square-foot -rrb- apartment is still a bargain compared to other european capitals and well below residential prices in city districts with a similar cachet , such as london 's gentrified islington or new york 's artsy greenwich village , according to thomas beyerle , a real estate expert at dresdner bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's prenzlauer berg has become a desired location yet only 11 percent of berliners are homeowners , in spite of low mortgage rates - only 4.5 percent over a 10-year period compared to a peak of 8 percent in 1995 .
except for expensive pockets in prime locations , such as prenzlauer berg or frankfurt 's sachsenhausen and munich 's schwabing districts , germany is also the only european country where the overall residential market has stagnated in the past decade . lowest rate of home ow n ership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : families like to buy a rowhouse with garden in other urban clusters - frankfurt , munich , hamburg , stuttgart , cologne and leipzig - five times as many households rent rather than own their bricks and mortar , bringing down germany 's rate of home ownership to 43 percent , rock bottom in the european union , excluding the new members in the east .
owner-occupancy rates are highest in spain at 82 percent , followed by ireland , italy , britain , according to the eu 's statistics agency eurostat . yet germans are legendary for their ability to save , and even deutsche bank 's affordability index - average monthly mortgage payments relative to disposable household income - has risen since 1975 .
in addition , according to a survey by infratest , nearly 80 percent of germans would prefer to be homeowners rather than renters .
so why do n't they buy ? why do n ' t germa n s buy ? the old adage " once a tenant , always a tenant " is more firmly entrenched in germany than elsewhere .
the legacy of world war ii , when allied bombing reduced all large cities to rubble , is partly to blame , according to tobias just , a senior economist specializing in real estate at deutsche bank . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cheap , cheap , cheap to rent in berlin " the acute housing shortage lasted well into the 1970s , so apartment blocks and multi-family dwellings went up very quickly , " said just , who added that renting has been historically far more attractive than buying .
" though high demand forced prices up , rents remained very stable and affordable .
that the landlord was often the city or some public entity implicitly meant that rents were subsidized , and below market value . " unlike other europeans , most germans live in apartments rather than single family houses , where home ownership rates are much higher . " the greater the number of housing units in a building , the lower the home ownership rate , " just said . re n ts are cheap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is looking more attractive to people though rents are relatively higher in growth regions around major urban centers in the west , and brandenburg and leipzig in the east , the average rental price for a modern , new flat is only seven euros per square meter -lrb- 11 square feet -rrb- - which would be considered dirt cheap by most . but rental subsidies and protections have started to fade in the last four years under hartz iv , the government 's welfare and labor market reform program .
according to a dresdner bank estimate , 10,000 rental households will be offered the chance to buy the home they live in over the next decade .

" now german bad boy christoph schlingensief is taking on an even more controversial topic - the last hour of princess diana 's life before she died in a paris car crash nine years ago . schlingensief is planning to open a play in berlin this month , which will run in london beginning in october under the name " the last hour of lady diana . "
a film version will be released in august 2007 to coincide with the 10th anniversary of diana 's death . he says these productions are part of a larger project . " this diana piece completes my series which started with hitler , " he said in an interview with bloomberg .
" these are all people that have inspired myths around themselves . " new theories the play is already causing outrage , particularly because of a scene in which queen elizabeth is shown giving a nazi salute .
it also features a new take on the death of diana spencer . " i have very interesting information that she really died in london , not in paris , and reconstruct this new truth , " schlingensief told bloomberg .
" it can probably never be exactly clarified what happened in that hour of her death .
art has the freedom to interpret this . " he announced the film version at the venice film festival friday just before the premiere of stephen frears ' " the queen , " a full-length feature about queen elizabeth 's reaction to diana 's death . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief is used to controversy already , the planned movie is creating a buzz because of schlingensief 's choice of jenny elvers-elbertzhagen to portray the princess .
she is probably better known by her presence on the german party circuit than her thespian abilities . " jenny is my princess diana because she , like diana , inspires longing in people , " he told the german mass-market newspaper bild .
" she resembles diana in that both of them seem to be in reach but never are . " secret shooting even though it is elvers-elbertzhagen 's personal life that grabs the spotlight , she did win critical acclaim for her portrayal of a single mother this year in detlev buck 's " knallhart -lrb- tough enough -rrb- . " still in production , the film version has partially been shot in paris , including at the ritz hotel from which diana departed shortly before her death .
london is a different matter altogether , he said . " in london , we will have to work secretly because diana is holy there , " he told bild .
" everybody goes jittery the minute you mention her name . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diana is still mourned in the uk and around the world already , the royals are upset , saying that such works exploit the memory of diana . no stranger to controversy schlingensief is best-known for his germany trilogy , consisting of : " die letzte stunde in führerbunker " -lrb- " 100 years of adolf hitler " -rrb- , a spoof of the third reich and hitler 's final hours ; " das deutsche kettensägen massaker " -lrb- " the german chainsaw massacre " -rrb- , which depicts relations between east and west germans as a slaughter of easterners by westerners ; and " terror 2000 - intensivestation deutschland , " featuring neo-nazis in post-reunification germany . he has also caused a stir with theatre productions about rapists , plays featuring real neo-nazis , a production of " parsifal " at bayreuth 's famous opera festival that featured a dead rabbit with worms crawling out of it and a movie called " freakstars 3000 , " which lampoons the american idol tv show with handicapped people . he says that he is deliberately challenging people to lose their sense political correctness and look under the surface . " as the son of a pharmacist , i knew my father poisoned his customers with small doses , " he told bloomberg .

the german government has offered to lead the naval component of the un interim force in lebanon -lrb- unifil -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lebanese prime minister fuad siniora even as berlin awaited a formal written request to the same effect , it emerged that beirut would only send a written request for troops to both berlin and the un only after israel lifted its air and sea blockade of the region . the move is largely interpreted as a tactic to step up pressure on israel to end its blockade .
beirut considers the blockade as illegal under united nations resolution 1701 governing a fragile ceasefire with israel .
according to observers , the siniora government has been under pressure from hezbollah ministers in his cabinet not to make too many concessions to the united nations and israel . germany wants clear and robust mandate another cause for concern in berlin is the news from beirut that the german naval force can only be deployed seven miles off the lebanese coast .
that would make an efficient search for arms smugglers difficult , according to experts . defense minister franz josef jung attempted to put a brave face on the lebanese government ’ s decision . " we haven ’ t received an official request so far which after all has to come through united nations channels , " jung said .
" it ‘ s crucial that we get a mandate from the world body and maybe we ’ ll hear more from its new york headquarters in the course of the next few days . " in the meanwhile , the french government on tuesday said lebanon has asked that its navy patrol the coast while other nations prepare their participation in the mission .
paris was considering the request , made via the united nations , " very favourably , " the french foreign ministry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel visits a submarine at the marine base in rostock-warnemünde germany insists on a clear request from beirut coupled with a robust mandate from the united nations .
pending approval by the german parliament , up to 3,000 troops and some 13 vessels are then planned to be sent to the troubled region .
they are to prevent sea-based arms smuggling mainly from syria to hezbollah militants . the german defense ministry has said it would take about two weeks to deploy in the middle east once the mission is formally approved by the german parliament . the country has ruled out sending ground troops , wanting to avoid any confrontation with israeli soldiers because of germany 's role in the holocaust . germany , once loathe to send troops abroad because of its world war ii history , is currently taking part in 10 international military missions .
there has been public resistance to some of the interventions , notably germany 's decision to the lead the european union peacekeeping force in the democratic republic of congo . hope for lifting of israeli blockade german foreign minster frank walter steinmeier said on tuesday he was confident that beirut would change its mind . " i believe the lebanese government will eventually come to realize that their ultimate goal of lifting the blockade can only be achieved in the wake of the deployment of a strong international force , " steinmeier said on tuesday . in the meantime , german government members have said they can only sit on their hands and keep prepared for a speedy decision once an official request has been made . chancellor angela merkel was already forced to cancel a special cabinet meeting on monday scheduled to pave the way for a parliamentary decision later this week . but there may also be fresh hope according to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
in the egyptian port city of alexandria on tuesday , he said that beirut would be receiving good news from israel within the next 48 hours - the strongest indication yet that israel could indeed lift its blockade . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lebanon to request german participation in un force lebanese prime minister fuad seniora said monday that lebanon was drafting a letter to the un formally requesting that germany participate in the un force in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.09.2006 opinion : new anti-terror tool comes way too late großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german security officials have ended a long deadlock by agreeing on a centralized database for terrorism suspects .
the measure comes at the wrong time and does little to make people feel safe , says dw 's marcel fürstenau . no matter what one might think of the anti-terror database , in one respect it should give its happy proponents some serious food for thought - namely , the fact that the measure only came about in the wake of the recent failed bomb attacks on passenger trains . the security debate that followed the discovery of the planned attacks ran along familiar lines - politicians howled for tighter laws though they knew well that no law in this world can stop terrorists resolved to do anything to carry out attacks with fatal consequences . fra n tic , populist politicia n s german interior minister wolfgang schäuble did admit that the attacks , which luckily failed , could not have been prevented even if a centralized database for terrorism suspects had existed then .
the failed attacks however were still reason enough to call a special conference of federal and state interior ministers . the fact that there was no plausible link between the narrowly failed diabolic plan hatched by young fanatics and the understandable desire for more security and improved counter-terrorism measures thus played no role . but what did play a role was a constructed link , devised by frantic , partly populist politicians who used the urgent mood to push through a controversial anti-terror database that they have wrangled over in the five years since the monstrous attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 .
five years , during which there have been countless further terrorist attacks in the world ; five years , during which politicians and security experts have constantly spoken of a " german threat " without managing to localize or even identify a concrete danger . database could have bee n decided earlier just to avoid any misunderstandings : of course one has to take international terrorism seriously - even in germany , which may be pretty low down on the enemy list of islamist terrorists , but which has been particularly attractive in the past as a terrorist harbor and possibly still is .
it 's well known that the sept .
11 suicide bombers hatched their plans here . that may be a good , understandable and even convincing argument for an anti-terror database .
but in the moment where the danger was not just theoretical , but very real in a tragic way , when over 3,000 people were brutally killed in geographically far-away yet politically close america - in that situation , german politicians were incapable of introducing an anti-terror database . the conservatives wanted to ride roughshod over every legal concern and do away with the constitutionally-anchored separation between the police and intelligence agencies .
and the other camp - leftists , greens , liberals - saw the end of the rule of law in any attempt to gather and access data for counter-terrorism purposes .
both positions were overly exaggerated . a compromise could have been possible even shortly after the sept .
11 attacks - particularly within an international framework . co n veyi n g a feeli n g of safety the current compromise on the anti-terror database instead stems from a mixture of a real threat exemplified by the suspected suitcase bombers and a partly hysterical reaction by some politicians .
the latter can be thankful that no one in germany fell victim to a terrorist attack in the time they wasted since 2001 .
if that had indeed been the case , we would now be witnessing an embarrassing row over how such an attack could have been prevented .
should we really have victims of terror attacks some day , there will once again be strong words and accusations flying about - even though everyone knows that there can never be complete security . what counts is conveying a feeling of safety and the impression that the danger can be dealt with resolve and moderation . a frantically thrashed out anti-terror database however raises suspicion and mistrust . if the creators of the law have real bad luck , the new weapon in the fight against terrorism may yet be defused by germany 's highest court because it violates the constitution . marcel fürste n au is a political correspo n de n t for dw-radio -lrb- sp -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reaches agreement on anti-terrorism measure germany 's federal interior ministers have reached a compromise on a long-planned anti-terrorism database as security concerns take on added urgency in the wake of failed bomb attacks on german trains .

" we are experiencing a classic economic upswing , " he said , predicting that the 2006 gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- would expand by two percent or more . due to higher than expected tax revenue and declining unemployment , germany is expected to post a budget deficit of 2.8 percent this year , steinbrück said . germany still spending more than it takes in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany dropped the amount it borrows by 16 billion euros compared to 2006 though he called the upswing in the euro zone 's largest economy " broad and robust " during the parliamentary debate on the 2007 budget , he also added that germans may not want to get too excited since he could not say " how sustainable this growth is . " the 2007 federal budget , totaling 267.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 343.5 billion -rrb- , will still spend more than it takes in , forcing the government to borrow 22 billion euros to help pay its bills but will meet the euro bloc 's three percent deficit limit . germany fell back within the eu growth and stability pact rules in the first half of 2006 by reducing its national deficit to 2.5 percent , the federal statistics office announced in august .
but the 2007 budget is the first time since 2002 berlin is forecasting it will stay within the rules . much of the additional revenue helping shore up germany 's financial plans comes from its biggest post-war tax increase , which was approved earlier this year and takes effect in january .
the hike will raise the value-added tax rate three percentage points to 19 percent , increase income taxes for high earners and slash tax write-offs . eu pleased with german progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almunia said germany 's budgetary work is positive but not finished yet a spokeswoman for european union economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said steinbrück 's prediction that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent this year was " good news . " almunia has been pressing steinbrück to put germany 's economy back on track for several months , arguing that faster german growth is vital to spur the euro zone 's overall recovery . the eu added that while it was important that germany fell in line with bloc rules , it should aim to bring the national debt down from its current 69 percent to under 60 percent of the gdp and have a " balanced budget by the end of the decade . " opposition questions tax increase green party budget expert anja hajduk said the government had done too little as the tax burden for the german public increases next year . members of the free-market liberal fdp , the largest opposition party , called on the government to call off its plans to increase the value-added tax . " the people are being called on to pay , " the fdp 's hermann otto solms said .

but her crippling multiple sclerosis -lrb- ms -rrb- meant she borrowed £ 12,000 to go abroad for highly-controversial stem cell treatment - despite living on benefits .
over 14 years , patricia 's ms has disabled her body and even her voice .
the 66-year-old , of hythe , near southampton , has been left unable to feed , wash , or dress herself .
stem cell therapy - which is unlicensed in the uk - was " her only hope " , she told the bbc news website before her treatment in the netherlands in april .
the firm she paid is called advanced cell therapeutics -lrb- act -rrb- , based in switzerland .
it supplies the stem cells and organises the treatment at several clinics around the world .
initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' patricia frost mrs frost 's took place at the preventative medicine clinic -lrb- pmc -rrb- in rotterdam - and she was told it would take three to six months for the full benefits to take effect .
pmc said the procedure did not involve embryonic stem cells - the subject of much ethical debate - but umbilical cord blood stem cells , which they said were taken from full-term babies with their parents ' consent .
but bbc newsnight has uncovered evidence to suggest the stem cells act supplies are not intended for use in humans .
mrs frost took out a bank loan to fund the £ 12,000 treatment the cells may contain animal protein and are allegedly for research purposes only .
the programme also revealed evidence to suggest a couple wanted by the fbi in the us on suspicion of selling false and misleading stem cell treatments , stephen van rooyen and laura brown , are behind act .
controversy has surrounded the firm for months .
at the time of mrs frost 's treatment in april , british stem cell scientist professor neil scolding , of bristol 's frenchay hospital , said act refused " to give any scientific details of how they prepare the cells " .
at the time , bbc news also approached act directly - seeking information about their procedures - but it failed to respond , despite saying it would .
pmc was also - and remains - the subject of an investigation by the dutch ministry of health , welfare and sport after top neurologists in the netherlands complained about their work .
the clinic is accused of not having submitted proposals to any research ethics committee in the netherlands to carry out clinical trials .
' instant improvements ' yet within one hour of being injected with the stem cells , mrs frost said she felt instant improvements .
in the taxi from the clinic to the airport she began to turn her head from side to side and lifted her arms - something she said she " could n't do before " .
whatever did or did not cause the change , it left mrs frost a very happy woman .
and four months later , she said despite the allegations , she " has no regrets " .
" initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' .
" but then thinking back there has been some improvement , even if it 's very slight .
they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies stephen van rooyen 's lawyers " what movement i got still has n't gone .
and i can still turn my head round , " she said .
" i did straighten my fingers a lot but i ca n't just lately - but of course the hot weather messes everything up . "
as she slowly fed herself a biscuit she added : " so i do n't regret going , i just feel sorry for the people that hoped a lot more than i did .
" but if you had n't been you 'd always be wondering whether it worked or not . "
" it 's a risk you take with anything . "
in conventional medical circles , it is agreed stem cells have the potential to evolve into other cells and they could be used in the future as a potential repair kit for the human body .
the department of health acknowledges this and is investing £ 100m in stem cell research over the next two years .
but it has urged caution against seeking treatment or procedures that have not been subjected to rigorous clinical trials .
' no negative effects ' since the newsnight programme was broadcast , pmc has cancelled its act treatments .
lawyers for steven van rooyen denied the allegations .
" the cells supplied to act are exclusively human umbilical cord stem cells donated free by consenting parents in the first world ... they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies , " they said .
" the cells supplied by act have certificates of analysis from accredited laboratories to prove their type , viability and purity .
" these certificates are provided in advance of any treatment to the doctors who administer the therapy .
" no recipient of act 's therapies has ever reported adverse or negative side effects despite administering 736 treatments for over 80 conditions -lrb- primarily neurological -rrb- over a four-year period . "

but her crippling multiple sclerosis -lrb- ms -rrb- meant she borrowed £ 12,000 to go abroad for highly-controversial stem cell treatment - despite living on benefits .
over 14 years , patricia 's ms has disabled her body and even her voice .
the 66-year-old , of hythe , near southampton , has been left unable to feed , wash , or dress herself .
stem cell therapy - which is unlicensed in the uk - was " her only hope " , she told the bbc news website before her treatment in the netherlands in april .
the firm she paid is called advanced cell therapeutics -lrb- act -rrb- , based in switzerland .
it supplies the stem cells and organises the treatment at several clinics around the world .
initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' patricia frost mrs frost 's took place at the preventative medicine clinic -lrb- pmc -rrb- in rotterdam - and she was told it would take three to six months for the full benefits to take effect .
pmc said the procedure did not involve embryonic stem cells - the subject of much ethical debate - but umbilical cord blood stem cells , which they said were taken from full-term babies with their parents ' consent .
but bbc newsnight has uncovered evidence to suggest the stem cells act supplies are not intended for use in humans .
mrs frost took out a bank loan to fund the £ 12,000 treatment the cells may contain animal protein and are allegedly for research purposes only .
the programme also revealed evidence to suggest a couple wanted by the fbi in the us on suspicion of selling false and misleading stem cell treatments , stephen van rooyen and laura brown , are behind act .
controversy has surrounded the firm for months .
at the time of mrs frost 's treatment in april , british stem cell scientist professor neil scolding , of bristol 's frenchay hospital , said act refused " to give any scientific details of how they prepare the cells " .
at the time , bbc news also approached act directly - seeking information about their procedures - but it failed to respond , despite saying it would .
pmc was also - and remains - the subject of an investigation by the dutch ministry of health , welfare and sport after top neurologists in the netherlands complained about their work .
the clinic is accused of not having submitted proposals to any research ethics committee in the netherlands to carry out clinical trials .
' instant improvements ' yet within one hour of being injected with the stem cells , mrs frost said she felt instant improvements .
in the taxi from the clinic to the airport she began to turn her head from side to side and lifted her arms - something she said she " could n't do before " .
whatever did or did not cause the change , it left mrs frost a very happy woman .
and four months later , she said despite the allegations , she " has no regrets " .
" initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' .
" but then thinking back there has been some improvement , even if it 's very slight .
they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies stephen van rooyen 's lawyers " what movement i got still has n't gone .
and i can still turn my head round , " she said .
" i did straighten my fingers a lot but i ca n't just lately - but of course the hot weather messes everything up . "
as she slowly fed herself a biscuit she added : " so i do n't regret going , i just feel sorry for the people that hoped a lot more than i did .
" but if you had n't been you 'd always be wondering whether it worked or not . "
" it 's a risk you take with anything . "
in conventional medical circles , it is agreed stem cells have the potential to evolve into other cells and they could be used in the future as a potential repair kit for the human body .
the department of health acknowledges this and is investing £ 100m in stem cell research over the next two years .
but it has urged caution against seeking treatment or procedures that have not been subjected to rigorous clinical trials .
' no negative effects ' since the newsnight programme was broadcast , pmc has cancelled its act treatments .
lawyers for steven van rooyen denied the allegations .
" the cells supplied to act are exclusively human umbilical cord stem cells donated free by consenting parents in the first world ... they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies , " they said .
" the cells supplied by act have certificates of analysis from accredited laboratories to prove their type , viability and purity .
" these certificates are provided in advance of any treatment to the doctors who administer the therapy .
" no recipient of act 's therapies has ever reported adverse or negative side effects despite administering 736 treatments for over 80 conditions -lrb- primarily neurological -rrb- over a four-year period . "

but her crippling multiple sclerosis -lrb- ms -rrb- meant she borrowed £ 12,000 to go abroad for highly-controversial stem cell treatment - despite living on benefits .
over 14 years , patricia 's ms has disabled her body and even her voice .
the 66-year-old , of hythe , near southampton , has been left unable to feed , wash , or dress herself .
stem cell therapy - which is unlicensed in the uk - was " her only hope " , she told the bbc news website before her treatment in the netherlands in april .
the firm she paid is called advanced cell therapeutics -lrb- act -rrb- , based in switzerland .
it supplies the stem cells and organises the treatment at several clinics around the world .
initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' patricia frost mrs frost 's took place at the preventative medicine clinic -lrb- pmc -rrb- in rotterdam - and she was told it would take three to six months for the full benefits to take effect .
pmc said the procedure did not involve embryonic stem cells - the subject of much ethical debate - but umbilical cord blood stem cells , which they said were taken from full-term babies with their parents ' consent .
but bbc newsnight has uncovered evidence to suggest the stem cells act supplies are not intended for use in humans .
mrs frost took out a bank loan to fund the £ 12,000 treatment the cells may contain animal protein and are allegedly for research purposes only .
the programme also revealed evidence to suggest a couple wanted by the fbi in the us on suspicion of selling false and misleading stem cell treatments , stephen van rooyen and laura brown , are behind act .
controversy has surrounded the firm for months .
at the time of mrs frost 's treatment in april , british stem cell scientist professor neil scolding , of bristol 's frenchay hospital , said act refused " to give any scientific details of how they prepare the cells " .
at the time , bbc news also approached act directly - seeking information about their procedures - but it failed to respond , despite saying it would .
pmc was also - and remains - the subject of an investigation by the dutch ministry of health , welfare and sport after top neurologists in the netherlands complained about their work .
the clinic is accused of not having submitted proposals to any research ethics committee in the netherlands to carry out clinical trials .
' instant improvements ' yet within one hour of being injected with the stem cells , mrs frost said she felt instant improvements .
in the taxi from the clinic to the airport she began to turn her head from side to side and lifted her arms - something she said she " could n't do before " .
whatever did or did not cause the change , it left mrs frost a very happy woman .
and four months later , she said despite the allegations , she " has no regrets " .
" initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' .
" but then thinking back there has been some improvement , even if it 's very slight .
they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies stephen van rooyen 's lawyers " what movement i got still has n't gone .
and i can still turn my head round , " she said .
" i did straighten my fingers a lot but i ca n't just lately - but of course the hot weather messes everything up . "
as she slowly fed herself a biscuit she added : " so i do n't regret going , i just feel sorry for the people that hoped a lot more than i did .
" but if you had n't been you 'd always be wondering whether it worked or not . "
" it 's a risk you take with anything . "
in conventional medical circles , it is agreed stem cells have the potential to evolve into other cells and they could be used in the future as a potential repair kit for the human body .
the department of health acknowledges this and is investing £ 100m in stem cell research over the next two years .
but it has urged caution against seeking treatment or procedures that have not been subjected to rigorous clinical trials .

pmc was also - and remains - the subject of an investigation by the dutch ministry of health , welfare and sport after top neurologists in the netherlands complained about their work .
the clinic is accused of not having submitted proposals to any research ethics committee in the netherlands to carry out clinical trials .
' instant improvements ' yet within one hour of being injected with the stem cells , mrs frost said she felt instant improvements .
in the taxi from the clinic to the airport she began to turn her head from side to side and lifted her arms - something she said she " could n't do before " .
whatever did or did not cause the change , it left mrs frost a very happy woman .
and four months later , she said despite the allegations , she " has no regrets " .
" initially i got results , and then when it stopped i was saying to my husband ' oh it 's a con , it 's a real con ' .
" but then thinking back there has been some improvement , even if it 's very slight . "
they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies " stephen van rooyen 's lawyers " what movement i got still has n't gone .
and i can still turn my head round , " she said .
" i did straighten my fingers a lot but i ca n't just lately - but of course the hot weather messes everything up . "
as she slowly fed herself a biscuit she added : " so i do n't regret going , i just feel sorry for the people that hoped a lot more than i did .
" but if you had n't been you 'd always be wondering whether it worked or not . "
" it 's a risk you take with anything . "
in conventional medical circles , it is agreed stem cells have the potential to evolve into other cells and they could be used in the future as a potential repair kit for the human body .
the department of health acknowledges this and is investing £ 100m in stem cell research over the next two years .
but it has urged caution against seeking treatment or procedures that have not been subjected to rigorous clinical trials .
' no negative effects ' since the newsnight programme was broadcast , pmc has cancelled its act treatments .
lawyers for steven van rooyen denied the allegations .
" the cells supplied to act are exclusively human umbilical cord stem cells donated free by consenting parents in the first world ... they are certainly not animal cells , nor are they designated solely for animal studies , " they said .
" the cells supplied by act have certificates of analysis from accredited laboratories to prove their type , viability and purity .
" these certificates are provided in advance of any treatment to the doctors who administer the therapy .
" no recipient of act 's therapies has ever reported adverse or negative side effects despite administering 736 treatments for over 80 conditions -lrb- primarily neurological -rrb- over a four-year period . "

six police forces are now using the technology , which relies on new compression techniques to transmit digital prints over mobile phones .
professor nigel allinson from sheffield university said matches could now be made within hours as opposed to days .
the time saved has allowed police to arrest known burglars earlier , reducing the incidence of crime .
" where this system was first trialled in lincolnshire , burglaries dropped by 40 % , " the researcher told the british association 's science festival .
" this is because if you catch someone after a day rather than two weeks , it makes all the difference ; it 's usually only a small number of people who commit house burglaries . "
ridge and furrow the system equips scenes of crime officers with a digital scanner and a laptop with a wireless card .
the investigators will make physical copies of prints in the traditional way , but instead of waiting until perhaps the end of the day to return them to the lab , the officers can also now return electronic copies immediately for cross-checking with criminal records .
this has been made possible by a process of 15-to-one compression which allows the file to be transmitted in under a minute but still retain sufficient detail to make a match possible .
" limited bandwidth means that a normal fingerprint image would take between four and 20 minutes to transmit , which is far too long .
so you have to compress the image , and in doing that you can lose information , " explained professor allinson .
" fingerprint identification is all about looking for minutiae - for discontinuities in the ridge and furrow pattern .
experimentation has determined the optimum level of compression which allows officers to transmit prints with no loss of information in 30-60 seconds . "
once an image is back at the lab , it can be checked against computer records in the normal way .
the fastest time from dusting a print to making a match is just two hours .
shoe search the rapid print checking system is now being rolled out to all 43 police forces in england and wales after being approved by the national fingerprint board earlier this year .
professor allinson 's team is also developing a system to electronically cross-match shoeprints left at crime scenes .
new powers under the serious and organised crime act oblige suspects to give impressions of their footwear , and permit police to store this evidence on a searchable database .
the computer system being developed by the sheffield team would allow for rapid comparison of those sole impressions with 12,000 known models of shoe .
the technology will have to be robust enough to cope with different sized shoes and partial prints .
such evidence does not have the unique qualities of dna or fingerprint evidence , which can tie evidence to a particular individual ; but police are convinced shoes can give them valuable leads , especially when footmarks may be the only trace a criminal leaves at the scene .
" the west yorkshire force , for example , examines 10,000 crime scenes annually , " said professor allinison .
" forensic scientific support is important both for volume as well as serious crime .
there is a recognition that we need to make scientific support more effective and efficient , and to take a more proactive role . "

about 30 others were injured in the accident late on monday near the town of shibin al-qanater .
two weeks ago another collision involving commuter trains in the same area killed 58 people .
it was egypt 's worst rail accident in four years .
public outrage was sparked by the poor condition of egypt 's transport network .
the cause of monday 's crash is still unknown .
security sources told reuters that rescue workers had recovered two bodies from the wreckage , including the driver of one of the trains .
they were working to free three more bodies believed to be trapped under two overturned carriages , the sources said .

mrs hutchings and her husband william took over the pub five-and-a-half years ago - in the same week as foot-and-mouth was discovered in the uk .
i think we 'll have a very big drink for the staff janet hutchings it was an " inauspicious start " according to mrs hutchings , followed by a " hefty learning curve " in the months and years to follow .
she said of the michelin award : " it 's just fantastic .
we 're absolutely thrilled , all of us are , that they have chosen us out of everybody in the uk .
" i do n't quite know how we have done it - we do what we 'd like to receive .
" the staff are quite excited because it makes them feel as if they 're doing something right .
" i think we 'll have a very big drink for the staff ! "
the pub has previously won two michelin " red tankard " awards which acknowledge pubs which serve good food .
catering mrs hutchings works full-time at the pub , while her husband organises the wine list in the evenings after coming home from his job at kraft foods in cheltenham .
she had previous experience in the food business but running a pub was a new experience for both of them .
" i had my own catering company , doing weddings , christenings and corporate entertainment - there 's no comparison at all to this , " she said .
" it 's very much 24/7 .
we live on site and our two children have grown up with it .
" they enjoy it here and are desperate to come and work downstairs . "
the couple had no idea they were in the running for the award , nor even that the michelin judges had visited the pub .
mrs hutchings said : " they 're probably the least likely that you 'd spot .
they pay as a normal customer .
inspectors are easy and aa people , generally because you recognise the name .
" when they phoned up we had no idea who they were - just three people from london as far as we knew . "

from 1 october , dhl - best known for delivering parcels - will supply everything from stationery to bed linen and mri scanners to english hospitals .
the deal is opposed by trade unions and will see 1,700 nhs employees transferred to the private sector .
more than £ 22bn of orders over 10 years will be affected .
the company says it will save the nhs £ 1bn in that period .
the contract will be officially announced on tuesday .
dhl is best known for delivering documents and freight , but has evolved into a company that is also involved in logistics and supply chain work on behalf of organisations across the world .
its deal with the nhs is one of many contracts it has as part of its dhl exel logistics division , which was formed in 2005 .
market power dhl logistics chief executive john allan told bbc news quality would not be sacrificed to save money .
staff across the nhs will be watching this privatisation deal , which will be viewed by many as symbolic of what is to come unison " we are hoping to achieve efficiency benefits in buying for the nhs , which they will be able to feed back into patient care .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- altered city : new york five years on bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 5 september 2006 , 07:09 gmt 08:09 uk altered city : new york five years on in the first of a series , the bbc 's stephen evans - who was in the world trade center at the time of the 11 september attacks - returns to new york to see how it has changed five years on .
there are obvious ways in which new york is different from the way it was on 10 september , 2001 .
downtown is transformed - the gaping gash of the world trade center remains largely unfilled .
the pit is acquiring the machinery which will be the working engine of the freedom tower , and there is a new underground station , but ground zero is still a wound .
and that gives a different look to the whole city .
the twin towers were a landmark that could be seen all over manhattan so if you emerged from the subway , you only had to look up and know which direction you were facing .
the gap when you look down 7th avenue , for example , now feels like something is missing - which , of course , there is .
the open sky seems like the absence of a limb or a pair of teeth knocked out .
ghosts new york has changed in quieter ways too .
downtown was the great financial centre - wall street - arguably the financial capital of the world .
it still is , though many of the people who worked there now work elsewhere . "
i think anybody who is in new york , or who lost somebody or who paid witness that day , has a bunch of little gremlins under their bed " david handschuh send us your comments the attacks on 11 september pushed the big finance houses out from what had been often old , inconvenient offices , and many have not moved back .
there has been some regeneration , but often by people in homes rather than companies in offices .
the mix of the region has changed , with more residential accommodation , partly encouraged by the lower rents on offer after the attacks .
some people were uneasy about living downtown - there was a feeling that the place had the smell of death to it , literally .
the ghosts were too obvious .
and the people have also changed .
talk to anybody and they have got a story to tell of what they were doing on the day .
how can you witness two planes being flown into towers of innocent people without thinking a lot about it ?
take david handschuh .
he is still a photographer on the daily news but now he confines his pictures to food - something he says makes people happy - rather than to the car crashes and crime which were his daily diet before .
david was probably the first photographer on the scene on 11 september , arriving before the second plane went in .
he witnessed at close view through a lens the people jumping and heard them landing - and all before getting trapped under the falling south tower to be pulled out , badly injured , by fire-fighters .
he has changed .
to drive with him round the city now is to experience a great external calm .
painful process a lorry cuts him up and he smiles saying : " go ahead .

it is important , too , to treat those remains with respect .
" when i see staten island , when i see the garbage dump - i realise that none of us can have the solace of a resting place , unless it 's a dignified resting place , " she says .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- jill dando 's murder : the new evidence bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home 07:09 gmt , tuesday , 5 september 2006 08:09 uk jill dando 's murder : the new evidence barry george has always denied he murdered miss dando the bbc 's panorama team has forensic analysis which questions the only piece of scientific evidence against the man jailed for murdering jill dando .
firearms residue expert professor marco morin says the single particle taken from barry george 's coat may not have even come from a gun .
he says it should not have been introduced as evidence .
george was convicted two years after ex-bbc presenter jill dando was shot once in the head in 1999 .
read reporter raphael rowe 's story about his investigation a juror has spoken publicly for the first time of her feelings about the guilty verdict reached in july 2001 .
juror janet herbert says : " i just felt shocked that on that little evidence anybody could be locked away for the rest of their life . "
the jury was put up in a hotel during a weekend because the members were unable to reach a verdict .
a second juror who wished to remain anonymous says that some of the deadlocked jury talked about the case at the hotel .
' excluded from discussions ' this was specifically against the judges instructions .
these instructions are meant to stop subcommittees forming cliques that could influence the final decision .
janet herbert felt excluded from these discussions .
reporter raphael rowe investigates whether there is new relevant evidence the jury should have heard .
he had exclusive access to case documents and exhibits .
barry george 's coat was found a year after the bbc presenter 's death and was taken from its evidence bag and photographed at a police station before it was examined by forensic scientists .
a witness , a retired reverend , claims that he saw police entering george 's flat with guns when they took the coat away but this has been denied by the police .
this may have contaminated the scene .
professor morin suggests that the particle may have come from an incinerator burning paint or from somebody arc welding .
panorama finds out that the jury members were never given information explaining why barry george was desperate to establish an alibi for the time jill dando was shot dead in the head on the doorstep of her home in london in 1999 .
george had been questioned about the rachel nickell murder on wimbledon common in 1992 .
he had nothing to do with that murder but he was afraid that he would be questioned again .
trying to establish the alibi made him look highly suspicious .
one witness , susan bicknell , tells the programme that she could provide george with an alibi but she suffered a nervous breakdown after the trial and fears her illness made her a poor witness when she took the stand .
contrary to the media coverage and prosecution case that george was obsessed with jill dando , there were only eight newspaper articles about her found in the stack of 800 newspapers in george 's house .
case reviewed none of the stories about her had been highlighted or clipped out or stuck on a wall .
a friend says that george never spoke about jill dando until after her death .
for the past two years , the criminal cases review commission has carried out a review of the case .
it says this has involved commissioning forensic tests and interviewing a number of witnesses and expects to make a decision about whether to refer it to the court of appeal " in the near future . "
george lost an appeal in 2002 and remains in jail .
panorama will submit its evidence to the commission .
on tuesday , a metropolitan police spokesman told bbc news : " this case was thoroughly investigated and the evidence put before a jury , who convicted barry george .
" a number of other matters were also raised before the court of appeal , which upheld the jury 's decision .
" this case is now under review by the criminal cases review commission , to whom the metropolitan police service continues to lend its fullest support .
" our thoughts remain with the family and friends of jill dando . "
some of your comments michael smith , sheffield if barry george is innocent , the justice system 's eagerness to convict means that the real perpetrator is now long gone , and that the tax payer will have to compensate barry george for the bungled investigation .
nancy stanley , london i thought the programme was excellent , also only someone with raphael rowe 's background could provide the insight and knowledge of the issues highlighted with the case .
i thought the coverage was impartial and first class .
well done to everyone involved in the making of this programme !
ewa piotrowska , london last night 's panorama showed clearly and impartially new evidence in the case of jill dando 's murder .
i feel fully convinced by the programme that the case should be reviewed again .
also , it has been a long time since i have seen such an impartial and faithul presentation of a very sensitive subject .
tony , oxford i can not believe that the bbc wasted licenece payers money on this " so called " investigation .
it produced no new evidence , just went over old claims and evidence that had already been heard by a jury -lrb- 10 of whose members found the evidence sufficient to decide that guilt was proven " beyond reasonable doubt " -rrb- .
as the case is also currently being reviewed , this programme was ill conceived and should never have even been considered let alone broadcast .
chris hogg , ashton , helston , cornwall whilst the italian firearms expert suggested that such a particle could have come from a number of sources other than a firearm -lrb- he mentioned paint -rrb- , i felt that an obvious source was not mentioned .
that source is a firework or other pyrotechnic device .
aluminium powder is used in fireworks to give brilliant light , and barium is used to provide green colouration .
the spherical shape of the particle would suggest it had been exposed to a high temperature , causing it to melt and become spherical , also consistent with a firework being the source .
a heavy overcoat is just the sort of thing one would wear to a firework display on a chilly winter 's evening .
alex mcewan , sandhurst something occurred to me watching the show that seemed an obvious question to ask , but no one mentioned it so presumably it had been checked .
it concerned the firearm discharge residue evidence , and how residue could easily be transferred from one person or place to another .
a number of possible explanations for the residue in barry george ¿ s coat pocket were suggested .
it also mentioned that george had made a number of visits to a gun club seeking membership .
did anyone ever check if he wore the coat in question on any of those visits , where presumably he would have shaken hands with people who had discharged firearms ?
philip burton , bristol if barry george is found to be innocent , then it will be a waste of another life in addition to that of jill dando and the killer may still be at large ?
are we any the wiser ?
paul dayton , london the press were right to lambast this film - particularly in that it expensively revealed almost nothing new .
eugen slichter , manchester programs like this usually explore other suspects but there was none of this .
i do n't recall much discussion of motive either .
i guess that was n't the point of the doc tho .
eric wyn roberts , pwllheli , north wales the public have a right to take a impartial view on this documentary but we are no nearer the truth of who actually pulled the trigger are we ?
will , uk an excellent documentary .
its terrifying how little evidence barry george was convicted by .
surely the case needs to be looked at again .
nick burdett , melton mowbray jill dando story , ' particle ' one source for this particle , high in lead , barium & aluminium could be burning pvc , which contains all of these .
dan fredenburgh , uk i felt i had to send an e-mail re this evening 's panorama on the murder of jill dando .
raphael rowes report was outstanding .
it was compelling , disturbing , and incredibly thorough .
jacqueline blake , aberdare an interesting programme raising issues i was not aware of .
the reporter raphael rowe was very good and impartial .
panorama at its best .
jill dando 's murder : the new evidence was on bbc one on september 5 2006 .

" i think anybody who is in new york , or who lost somebody or who paid witness that day , has a bunch of little gremlins under their bed , and every once in a while those gremlins leap out and they taunt you and they bite you and they want to play with you .
" so you play with them and then you put them back under your bed and maybe it 's five minutes , maybe it 's five days , maybe it 's five months till they come back out and play , but you 've got to confront your gremlins and then say ' you know what , folks , it 's time to move on , i 'll see you in six months ' .

robin goodman is a psychologist who worked with children .
many of them drew pictures of horror - two planes crashing into two towers , fire , osama bin laden snatching the towers and stuffing them into his mouth .
" you had kids building towers with lego and crashing them .
that 's not uncommon when you 've been through something traumatic , re-enacting it and re-experiencing it .
it 's a way to get mastery over it .
" if kids keep doing that and doing that , and do n't get relief , it can be a problem " .
diane horning wants a final resting place for her son it is a matter of coping with memory and loss .
for diane horning , the problem is different .
she lost her 26-year-old son , matthew .
unlike the relatives of some 1,150 people who were never identified , diane has a small amount of matthew 's remains .
but she believes the rest of his body to be in the fine siftings of material from ground zero that are on the fresh kills landfill site on staten island .
five years on she is still tirelessly campaigning to have these " fines " moved and buried " somewhere decent " .
" we 're not even asking them to dna test them .
we 've said ' give us a cemetery that is a common grave where we can put a marker for everyone , even if we do n't have individualized spots for each person ' . "
remains are still being found at the world trade center site , and diane says it 's important to relatives .
it is important , too , to treat those remains with respect .
" when i see staten island , when i see the garbage dump - i realise that none of us can have the solace of a resting place , unless it 's a dignified resting place , " she says .

page last updated at 07:09 gmt , tuesday , 5 september 2006 08:09 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version jill dando 's murder : the new evidence barry george has always denied he murdered miss dando barry george the bbc 's panorama team has forensic analysis which questions the only piece of scientific evidence against the man jailed for murdering jill dando .
firearms residue expert professor marco morin says the single particle taken from barry george 's coat may not have even come from a gun .
he says it should not have been introduced as evidence .
george was convicted two years after ex-bbc presenter jill dando was shot once in the head in 1999 .
read reporter raphael rowe 's story about his investigation a juror has spoken publicly for the first time of her feelings about the guilty verdict reached in july 2001 .
juror janet herbert says : " i just felt shocked that on that little evidence anybody could be locked away for the rest of their life . "
the jury was put up in a hotel during a weekend because the members were unable to reach a verdict .
a second juror who wished to remain anonymous says that some of the deadlocked jury talked about the case at the hotel .
' excluded from discussions ' this was specifically against the judges instructions .
these instructions are meant to stop subcommittees forming cliques that could influence the final decision .
janet herbert felt excluded from these discussions .
reporter raphael rowe investigates whether there is new relevant evidence the jury should have heard .
he had exclusive access to case documents and exhibits .
barry george 's coat was found a year after the bbc presenter 's death and was taken from its evidence bag and photographed at a police station before it was examined by forensic scientists .
a witness , a retired reverend , claims that he saw police entering george 's flat with guns when they took the coat away but this has been denied by the police .
this may have contaminated the scene .
professor morin suggests that the particle may have come from an incinerator burning paint or from somebody arc welding .
panorama finds out that the jury members were never given information explaining why barry george was desperate to establish an alibi for the time jill dando was shot dead in the head on the doorstep of her home in london in 1999 .
george had been questioned about the rachel nickell murder on wimbledon common in 1992 .
he had nothing to do with that murder but he was afraid that he would be questioned again .
trying to establish the alibi made him look highly suspicious .
one witness , susan bicknell , tells the programme that she could provide george with an alibi but she suffered a nervous breakdown after the trial and fears her illness made her a poor witness when she took the stand .
contrary to the media coverage and prosecution case that george was obsessed with jill dando , there were only eight newspaper articles about her found in the stack of 800 newspapers in george 's house .
case reviewed none of the stories about her had been highlighted or clipped out or stuck on a wall .
a friend says that george never spoke about jill dando until after her death .
for the past two years , the criminal cases review commission has carried out a review of the case .
it says this has involved commissioning forensic tests and interviewing a number of witnesses and expects to make a decision about whether to refer it to the court of appeal " in the near future . "
george lost an appeal in 2002 and remains in jail .
panorama will submit its evidence to the commission .
on tuesday , a metropolitan police spokesman told bbc news : " this case was thoroughly investigated and the evidence put before a jury , who convicted barry george .
" a number of other matters were also raised before the court of appeal , which upheld the jury 's decision .
" this case is now under review by the criminal cases review commission , to whom the metropolitan police service continues to lend its fullest support .
" our thoughts remain with the family and friends of jill dando . "
some of your comments michael smith , sheffield if barry george is innocent , the justice system 's eagerness to convict means that the real perpetrator is now long gone , and that the tax payer will have to compensate barry george for the bungled investigation .

that source is a firework or other pyrotechnic device .

the spherical shape of the particle would suggest it had been exposed to a high temperature , causing it to melt and become spherical , also consistent with a firework being the source .
a heavy overcoat is just the sort of thing one would wear to a firework display on a chilly winter 's evening .
alex mcewan , sandhurst something occurred to me watching the show that seemed an obvious question to ask , but no one mentioned it so presumably it had been checked .
it concerned the firearm discharge residue evidence , and how residue could easily be transferred from one person or place to another .
a number of possible explanations for the residue in barry george ¿ s coat pocket were suggested .

gazprom will pay $ 100 -lrb- £ 52 -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas until the end of 2008 , up from the $ 65 it now pays .
turkmenistan threatened to cut supplies to gazprom unless the state-run firm agreed to its price proposals .
gazprom exports most of the turkmen gas it buys onto other countries in the region , principally ukraine .
ukraine factor russia and ukraine recently reached a separate agreement about gas co-operation over the next 18 months although details about how much ukraine will pay for russian gas remain sketchy .
gazprom cut off supplies to ukraine at the start of the year during a price dispute which temporarily threatened exports to western europe .
but ukraine 's new prime minister viktor yanukovych - who is close to russian president vladimir putin - said last month that the two countries had agreed prices until the start of 2008 .
experts believe the turkmen-gazprom deal could affect ukraine , since gazprom has historically passed on much of its relatively inexpensive turkmen gas onto ukraine , therefore keeping prices down .
it exports most of its own , more expensive gas to western europe .
turkmenistan 's president , saparmurat niyazov , announced the deal following a meeting with gazprom executives in the capital ashkabad .
turkmenistan produces about 60 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year , with two thirds of exports going to gazprom .

gazprom will pay $ 100 -lrb- £ 52 -rrb- per 1,000 cubic metres of gas until the end of 2008 , up from the $ 65 it now pays .
turkmenistan threatened to cut supplies to gazprom unless the state-run firm agreed to its price proposals .
gazprom exports most of the turkmen gas it buys onto other countries in the region , principally ukraine .
ukraine factor russia and ukraine recently reached a separate agreement about gas co-operation over the next 18 months although details about how much ukraine will pay for russian gas remain sketchy .
gazprom cut off supplies to ukraine at the start of the year during a price dispute which temporarily threatened exports to western europe .
but ukraine 's new prime minister viktor yanukovych - who is close to russian president vladimir putin - said last month that the two countries had agreed prices until the start of 2008 .
experts believe the turkmen-gazprom deal could affect ukraine , since gazprom has historically passed on much of its relatively inexpensive turkmen gas onto ukraine , therefore keeping prices down .
it exports most of its own , more expensive gas to western europe .

queen 's performance at live aid in 1985 in front of over 70,000 people was voted the world 's greatest rock gig in a music industry poll .
mercury 's duet with opera singer monserrat caballe was the theme to the 1992 olympics in barcelona .
sadly , he died before they could perform together at the olympics .
although an iconic live performer , queen worldwide album sales are estimated to have exceeded 150m .
during over 20 years of performing , freddie was known almost as much for his flamboyant personal style as his music .
freddie mercury : lover of life , singer of songs runs from 8 september to 17 november at proud central , london .

most trade secrets are stolen by people working on the inside , who then sell them on to a rival company or exploit the know-how themselves for personal gain .
a bbc radio 4 investigation reveals that a new frontier is opening up in the corporate intelligence war , and the spy no longer needs to be on the inside - in fact , they can be thousands of miles away .
computer infiltration is becoming increasingly common target eye limited styled itself as a software development company .
it was registered in london , based in fashionable kensington .
but all was not what it seemed at target eye .
the registered address was simply a mailbox , and in reality the company was run from a house in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood of south london .
the company had developed a piece of sophisticated software - a so called trojan - which could infiltrate computers .
once installed , the program would provide a discreet window through which it could remotely spy on the computer and steal its contents .
an israeli couple , husband and wife michael and ruth haephrati , were behind target eye .
michael developed the software , which they then hoped to sell to global security services .
but there were no takers .
so the haephratis used their london base to spy on finance and communications companies around the world , from latin america to russia and europe .
sensitive information the spies saw information they are not allowed to see rani rahav communications one of their victims was rani rahav communications , a public relations agency in israel that deals with many of the country 's top companies .
the communications agency dealt with a lot of commercially sensitive information passed to it from clients , including details of new products or plans to acquire new businesses .
mr rahav told the bbc : " the spies saw information they are not allowed to see .
" for example , if i have some information in my system that one company is going to buy another company and you saw it before everyone else , you take that information and buy shares on the stock market and you can make a lot of money . "
the bbc has learnt of one mobile phone company in israel that had its new product details passed onto a rival , undermining the planned launch .
the authorities in israel eventually uncovered the espionage ring and the haephratis were extradited from london to stand trial .
the investigation revealed they were involved in upwards of 100 projects of espionage or attempted espionage .
telephone pitch a senior prosecution source in tel aviv told the bbc that ruth haephrati was the expert at implanting the trojan into the unknowing victims office computer system .
he said she would contact a senior executive proposing a bogus business deal .
ruth haephrati would offer companies a trojan-ridden cd she would start with a telephone pitch , before offering to send more detailed information on a cd .
she stressed that the offer was so commercially sensitive that only the executive should open it .
once the cd was installed , the trojan was let loose , but the company and the executive were none the wiser .
the haephratis were jailed earlier this year .
but the techniques the haephratis used are being adapted by others .
increasing risks trojan agents are now being sent to companies embedded in e-mail traffic .
messagelabs , an international it security firm , provides a global filtering service for companies and governments , scanning emails for spam and viruses .
according to mark sunner , the company 's chief technology officer , the emails are highly targeted and aimed at people in research and development or the company patent office .
the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available mark sunner not only that , they are engineered to appeal to those they want to open the trojans , or buried in commonplace business material , such as word documents or financial spreadsheets .
mr sunner says : " for the last 14 months , we 've been intercepting these kinds of threats at about two per week .
yet more recently , that number has ramped up to about one per day .
" the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available , and the mechanism to prevent these threats getting in , if you are using traditional mechanisms , has not kept pace with the way the threat has evolved . "

ruth haephrati would offer companies a trojan-ridden cd she would start with a telephone pitch , before offering to send more detailed information on a cd .
she stressed that the offer was so commercially sensitive that only the executive should open it .
once the cd was installed , the trojan was let loose , but the company and the executive were none the wiser .
the haephratis were jailed earlier this year .
but the techniques the haephratis used are being adapted by others .
increasing risks trojan agents are now being sent to companies embedded in e-mail traffic .
messagelabs , an international it security firm , provides a global filtering service for companies and governments , scanning emails for spam and viruses .
according to mark sunner , the company 's chief technology officer , the emails are highly targeted and aimed at people in research and development or the company patent office .
the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available mark sunner not only that , they are engineered to appeal to those they want to open the trojans , or buried in commonplace business material , such as word documents or financial spreadsheets .
mr sunner says : " for the last 14 months , we 've been intercepting these kinds of threats at about two per week .
yet more recently , that number has ramped up to about one per day .
" the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available , and the mechanism to prevent these threats getting in , if you are using traditional mechanisms , has not kept pace with the way the threat has evolved . "

most trade secrets are stolen by people working on the inside , who then sell them on to a rival company or exploit the know-how themselves for personal gain .
a bbc radio 4 investigation reveals that a new frontier is opening up in the corporate intelligence war , and the spy no longer needs to be on the inside - in fact , they can be thousands of miles away .
computer infiltration is becoming increasingly common target eye limited styled itself as a software development company .
it was registered in london , based in fashionable kensington .
but all was not what it seemed at target eye .
the registered address was simply a mailbox , and in reality the company was run from a house in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood of south london .
the company had developed a piece of sophisticated software - a so called trojan - which could infiltrate computers .
once installed , the program would provide a discreet window through which it could remotely spy on the computer and steal its contents .
an israeli couple , husband and wife michael and ruth haephrati , were behind target eye .
michael developed the software , which they then hoped to sell to global security services .
but there were no takers .
so the haephratis used their london base to spy on finance and communications companies around the world , from latin america to russia and europe .
sensitive information the spies saw information they are not allowed to see rani rahav communications one of their victims was rani rahav communications , a public relations agency in israel that deals with many of the country 's top companies .
the communications agency dealt with a lot of commercially sensitive information passed to it from clients , including details of new products or plans to acquire new businesses .
mr rahav told the bbc : " the spies saw information they are not allowed to see .
" for example , if i have some information in my system that one company is going to buy another company and you saw it before everyone else , you take that information and buy shares on the stock market and you can make a lot of money . "
the bbc has learnt of one mobile phone company in israel that had its new product details passed onto a rival , undermining the planned launch .
the authorities in israel eventually uncovered the espionage ring and the haephratis were extradited from london to stand trial .
the investigation revealed they were involved in upwards of 100 projects of espionage or attempted espionage .

most trade secrets are stolen by people working on the inside , who then sell them on to a rival company or exploit the know-how themselves for personal gain .
a bbc radio 4 investigation reveals that a new frontier is opening up in the corporate intelligence war , and the spy no longer needs to be on the inside - in fact , they can be thousands of miles away .
target eye limited styled itself as a software development company .
it was registered in london , based in fashionable kensington .
but all was not what it seemed at target eye .
the registered address was simply a mailbox , and in reality the company was run from a house in a more down-at-heel neighbourhood of south london .
the company had developed a piece of sophisticated software - a so called trojan - which could infiltrate computers .
once installed , the program would provide a discreet window through which it could remotely spy on the computer and steal its contents .
an israeli couple , husband and wife michael and ruth haephrati , were behind target eye .
michael developed the software , which they then hoped to sell to global security services .
but there were no takers .
so the haephratis used their london base to spy on finance and communications companies around the world , from latin america to russia and europe .
sensitive information " the spies saw information they are not allowed to see " rani rahav communications one of their victims was rani rahav communications , a public relations agency in israel that deals with many of the country 's top companies .
the communications agency dealt with a lot of commercially sensitive information passed to it from clients , including details of new products or plans to acquire new businesses .
mr rahav told the bbc : " the spies saw information they are not allowed to see .
" for example , if i have some information in my system that one company is going to buy another company and you saw it before everyone else , you take that information and buy shares on the stock market and you can make a lot of money . "
the bbc has learnt of one mobile phone company in israel that had its new product details passed onto a rival , undermining the planned launch .
the authorities in israel eventually uncovered the espionage ring and the haephratis were extradited from london to stand trial .
the investigation revealed they were involved in upwards of 100 projects of espionage or attempted espionage .
telephone pitch a senior prosecution source in tel aviv told the bbc that ruth haephrati was the expert at implanting the trojan into the unknowing victims office computer system .
he said she would contact a senior executive proposing a bogus business deal .
she would start with a telephone pitch , before offering to send more detailed information on a cd .
she stressed that the offer was so commercially sensitive that only the executive should open it .
once the cd was installed , the trojan was let loose , but the company and the executive were none the wiser .
the haephratis were jailed earlier this year .
but the techniques the haephratis used are being adapted by others .
increasing risks trojan agents are now being sent to companies embedded in e-mail traffic .
messagelabs , an international it security firm , provides a global filtering service for companies and governments , scanning emails for spam and viruses .
according to mark sunner , the company 's chief technology officer , the emails are highly targeted and aimed at people in research and development or the company patent office . "
the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available " mark sunner not only that , they are engineered to appeal to those they want to open the trojans , or buried in commonplace business material , such as word documents or financial spreadsheets .
mr sunner says : " for the last 14 months , we 've been intercepting these kinds of threats at about two per week .
yet more recently , that number has ramped up to about one per day .
" the capability to construct these trojans to infiltrate your organisation is all too readily available , and the mechanism to prevent these threats getting in , if you are using traditional mechanisms , has not kept pace with the way the threat has evolved . "
bugging the boardroom , a two-part investigation into industrial espionage , starts on tuesday 5 september at 2000 bst on bbc radio 4 .

pre-tax profits jumped 24 % to £ 68.7m -lrb- $ 130m -rrb- in the six months to 30 june , compared with £ 55.6m a year ago .
admiral , which owns several insurance brands including elephant , said total premiums were up 10 % to £ 294m .
admiral also said it was on target to launch operations in spain , and had already begun to investigate expansion opportunities in the market .
" as part of our longer-term strategy we will launch our spanish operation later this year or early next year and have already begun looking beyond spain at other opportunities , " said chief executive henry engelhardt .
premiums unchanged but the cardiff-based firm said it had no plans to increase its premiums this year , despite last week 's announcement from rival norwich union that it would raise its rates by an average of 16 % .
admiral had been the exception to 2005 's general freeze on premiums , raising its rates by 2.9 % .
" we can understand why norwich union has raised its premiums , " mr engelhardt told bbc news .
" but we have no immediate plans to increase our premiums .
this gives us an opportunity to grow our market share as competitors increase their rates . "
the company is also behind the online insurance comparison website confused.com , which , it said , experienced " significant growth " during the first half of the year as it ventured into the home and travel insurance markets .
profits from the website surged to £ 8.7m from £ 2.3m at the same time last year .

downing street has not commented on the document .
here are key quotes from it : the prime minister 's legacy " time is not an unlimited commodity .
his genuine legacy is not the delivery , important though that is , but the dominance of new labour ideas ... the triumph of blairism .
" as tb enters his final phase he needs to be focusing way beyond the finishing line , not looking at it .
" he needs to go with the crowds wanting more .
he should be the star who wo n't even play that last encore .
in moving towards the end he must focus on the future . "
blair vs brown " there are specific issues which can provide opportunities and threats .
they are : gb 's reaction ... the more successful we are the more it will agitate and possibly destabilise him , we need to consider how to deal . "
iraq " we need to incorporate this into our media plan .
it 's the elephant in the room , let 's face up to it ...
most importantly , are we up for it ?
is tb up for it ? "
blair 's last month " needs a daily grid , planned to the last detail .
" as much as possible a farewell tour , looking to the future , making sure the party is in the right place and the public remember him as he should be . "
connecting with the people " he needs to embrace open spaces , the arts and businesses , he needs to be seen to be travelling on different forms of transport .
he needs to be seen with people who will raise eyebrows .
" he needs to travel around the uk to be carefully positioned as someone who while not above politics , is certainly distancing himself from the political village .
" he should be dropping references in all that he does which reflect his energy and enthusiasm .
" this needs to move on from ' i 'm getting on with the job ' to ' this is a great job , i 'm very lucky , i wo n't have it one day and before that day comes i still have lots to do and say ' . "
in charge until the last " one where we make it clear that the pm will be spending his final period in office preparing britain for its future challenges , setting out what they are and connecting with the public who gave him the chance to serve . "
working with the pm and being seen in " iconic locations " " in seeking to achieve this the whole operation should reflect the change in the political atmosphere .
" tb focusing on his priorities : tb laying the foundations for the future based on his experience in office . " this positive approach needs to be reflected not only by tb but by all those who work and support him .
we should show how much we enjoy working for tb , what pride we take in our work and how we want his premiership to end on a high . "
above the political fray " while we need to do what is required to defend the government and ensure a clarity of message , we should not be drawn into hand-to-hand combat .
" but if some of our own side are not prepared to accept this , and the tories step up their attacks , then we will have to revisit ... but this whole approach has been adopted to avoid that , so we should work on the basis that we will have achieved this .
" as ever , this is not rocket science , we know what works well : strong , policy-focused events which have substance , striking pictures , words from tb and real people involved .
" but it is essential that we do all we can in our message and planning to ensure that we do not get knocked off by events . "
scotland and wales " wales and scotland - devolution despite the bumpy ride has been a success , tb should embrace this .

other plans the memo claims the exit strategy includes mr blair making appearances on blue peter , songs of praise and chris evans ' radio show .
he will reportedly spend a day , then an overnight in six cities across the country ; visit the 20 most striking buildings opened or redeveloped since 1997 ; increase the number of high-profile tours of schools and hospitals and avoid discussing job offers .

downing street has not commented on the document .
here are key quotes from it : the prime minister 's legacy " time is not an unlimited commodity .
his genuine legacy is not the delivery , important though that is , but the dominance of new labour ideas ... the triumph of blairism .
" as tb enters his final phase he needs to be focusing way beyond the finishing line , not looking at it .
" he needs to go with the crowds wanting more .
he should be the star who wo n't even play that last encore .
in moving towards the end he must focus on the future . "
blair vs brown " there are specific issues which can provide opportunities and threats .
they are : gb 's reaction ... the more successful we are the more it will agitate and possibly destabilise him , we need to consider how to deal . "
iraq " we need to incorporate this into our media plan .
it 's the elephant in the room , let 's face up to it ...
most importantly , are we up for it ?
is tb up for it ? "
blair 's last month " needs a daily grid , planned to the last detail .
" as much as possible a farewell tour , looking to the future , making sure the party is in the right place and the public remember him as he should be . "
connecting with the people " he needs to embrace open spaces , the arts and businesses , he needs to be seen to be travelling on different forms of transport .
he needs to be seen with people who will raise eyebrows .
" he needs to travel around the uk to be carefully positioned as someone who while not above politics , is certainly distancing himself from the political village .
" he should be dropping references in all that he does which reflect his energy and enthusiasm .
" this needs to move on from ' i 'm getting on with the job ' to ' this is a great job , i 'm very lucky , i wo n't have it one day and before that day comes i still have lots to do and say ' . "
in charge until the last " one where we make it clear that the pm will be spending his final period in office preparing britain for its future challenges , setting out what they are and connecting with the public who gave him the chance to serve . "
working with the pm and being seen in " iconic locations " " in seeking to achieve this the whole operation should reflect the change in the political atmosphere .
" tb focusing on his priorities : tb laying the foundations for the future based on his experience in office . " this positive approach needs to be reflected not only by tb but by all those who work and support him .
we should show how much we enjoy working for tb , what pride we take in our work and how we want his premiership to end on a high . "
above the political fray " while we need to do what is required to defend the government and ensure a clarity of message , we should not be drawn into hand-to-hand combat .
" but if some of our own side are not prepared to accept this , and the tories step up their attacks , then we will have to revisit ... but this whole approach has been adopted to avoid that , so we should work on the basis that we will have achieved this .
" as ever , this is not rocket science , we know what works well : strong , policy-focused events which have substance , striking pictures , words from tb and real people involved .
" but it is essential that we do all we can in our message and planning to ensure that we do not get knocked off by events . "
scotland and wales " wales and scotland - devolution despite the bumpy ride has been a success , tb should embrace this .
his profile should be raised in the major urban areas in advance of the elections . "
other plans the memo claims the exit strategy includes mr blair making appearances on blue peter , songs of praise and chris evans ' radio show .
he will reportedly spend a day , then an overnight in six cities across the country ; visit the 20 most striking buildings opened or redeveloped since 1997 ; increase the number of high-profile tours of schools and hospitals and avoid discussing job offers .
