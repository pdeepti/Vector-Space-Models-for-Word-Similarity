they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.10.2006 opinion : pressing issues for russian-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must make sure press freedom and human rights abuses remain a central theme in relations with russia , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . a shadow hung over this year 's petersburg dialogue : the very day on which the murdered journalist anna politovskaya was carried to her grave in moscow , the discussions at the annual german-russian expert forum were dominated by russia 's domestic situation . the critical , independent journalist 's murder as well as the ruthless actions against georgian citizens in moscow bring to mind pressing issues .
they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries .

russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .

" the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine .

" there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

an exhibit at the german hygiene museum traces the history of the nazi regime 's sinister health policies . the high-ceilinged rooms of the dresden museum display swastika-stamped posters praising nazi racial theories that lead to the holocaust . during the nazi era , the german hygiene museum was used to promote mass sterilizations and bans on what were considered interracial marriages .
many of the posters on display in the museum were designed there . so it 's appropriate that the museum would host the exhibit " deadly medicine : creating the master race , " which opens thursday . " the hygiene museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here , " museum director klaus vogel said .
but , he added , " it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless . " exhibit on loan from u.s. museum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curator susan bachrach explains the museum exhibit " deadly medicine " was created by the u.s. holocaust memorial museum and marks the first time one of the museum 's exhibits has traveled abroad . " this close relationship to the topic made it almost a requirement to bring the exhibit here , " vogel said . the exhibit 's opening comes just a week after mass graves were discovered in the western german city of menden .
the grave holds the remains of more than 20 people , many of them children , believed to have been killed by the nazis because they were disabled . thousands of frail children were murdered as part of the third reich 's " euthanasia " program .
children were killed after being deemed unfit to live . explaining murderous racial policies " deadly medicine " traces the history of this systematic effort by nazis to eliminate the " unfit " and create a " master race . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi-era glass man sculpture on display the first section of the exhibit shows how eugenics , a pseudoscience which purported to improve the human species by controlling heredity , became a global movement .
the second part picks up in 1933 , when the nazis began using eugenic theories to justify forced sterilizations and establish a " master race . " the third section explores how the nazis used science as a weapon not only to murder some six million jews in the holocaust , but hundreds of thousands of others who died under euthanasia programs or were otherwise deemed unfit . on sept .
1 , 1939 hitler signed an order for doctors to kill the fatally ill and handicapped .
historians believe that doctors and nurses stood by as nazis shot or gassed some 70,000 people from 1940 to 1941 .
while the program was officially abandoned after protests , the exhibit makes clear the mass killings continued in secret . tens of thousands of people were killed with medication in 1941 after the program had been ended or were simply starved to death . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war ii euthanasia victims found in german mass grave the skeletons of 20 children and five adults believed to be victims of the nazi euthanasia program have been found in a mass grave in western germany .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .

the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations germany -pipe- 11.10.2006 german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing grapes is a labor of love germany has only a small share of the global wine market , but it is mighty .
but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

the eu executive proposed adjusting alcohol taxes to reflect inflation .
eu-wide minimum tax rates on alcohol had not been changed in 14 years , it reasoned , and the increase would make a bottle of beer no more than one euro cent -lrb- less than one us cent -rrb- more expensive in germany . but that was obviously one cent too many for germany 's finance minister , who was possibly concerned the move would be a blow to his fellow citizens ' wallets and their local bartenders ' profits . " we do n't want to surprise the german public with beer getting more expensive , " he told journalists at an eu meeting in luxembourg . besides , the issue of an extra cent here or there is hardly a small matter in a country with more than 1,000 of the eu 's 3,000 breweries .
beer is king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending a german institution steinbrück did n't go so far as to threaten to use germany 's veto to block the plans , a step that his beer-loving neighbors in the czech republic had already taken .
but he made it plain that germany would only approve the tax hikes if beer was excluded from them . " that 's the good news for all those who like to drink a good pilsner , " he said of his protest . steinbrück did , however , make clear that tax rates could gladly be increased on wine and liquor .
after all , they 're already higher in germany than the eu plans foresee .
the minister 's insistence ought to ensure that all those who like to drink pilsner - or ale , porter , stout or wheat beer - pick up his tab the next time he fancies a drink . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .

the eu executive proposed adjusting alcohol taxes to reflect inflation .
eu-wide minimum tax rates on alcohol had not been changed in 14 years , it reasoned , and the increase would make a bottle of beer no more than one euro cent -lrb- less than one us cent -rrb- more expensive in germany . but that was obviously one cent too many for germany 's finance minister , who was possibly concerned the move would be a blow to his fellow citizens ' wallets and their local bartenders ' profits . " we do n't want to surprise the german public with beer getting more expensive , " he told journalists at an eu meeting in luxembourg . besides , the issue of an extra cent here or there is hardly a small matter in a country with more than 1,000 of the eu 's 3,000 breweries .
beer is king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending a german institution steinbrück did n't go so far as to threaten to use germany 's veto to block the plans , a step that his beer-loving neighbors in the czech republic had already taken .
but he made it plain that germany would only approve the tax hikes if beer was excluded from them . " that 's the good news for all those who like to drink a good pilsner , " he said of his protest . steinbrück did , however , make clear that tax rates could gladly be increased on wine and liquor .
after all , they 're already higher in germany than the eu plans foresee .
the minister 's insistence ought to ensure that all those who like to drink pilsner - or ale , porter , stout or wheat beer - pick up his tab the next time he fancies a drink . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .

the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated . " there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated . " there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

"
russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .
there are many projects planned in the energy and automobile sectors . " coming to germany while volkswagen , commerzbank and deutsche post have made splashy announcements about the billions they are investing in russia , russian investors have quietly begun buying their way into the german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have invested heavily in the german energy sector the biggest deals have come in the energy sector .
the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .
russian multi-millionaire rustam aksenenko , who owns a stake in the fashion house escada , said he thinks many russian investors are waiting for a chance to become more visibly involved with german corporations . " from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .
russian entrepreneurs frequently do n't inform german partners about their business activities .
the differences in mentality can create misunderstandings for russians investing in germany and vice versa . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and putin stress economic ties during talks economic issues and the murder of a prominent russian journalist dominated the talks between german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .

russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

the eu executive proposed adjusting alcohol taxes to reflect inflation .
eu-wide minimum tax rates on alcohol had not been changed in 14 years , it reasoned , and the increase would make a bottle of beer no more than one euro cent -lrb- less than one us cent -rrb- more expensive in germany . but that was obviously one cent too many for germany 's finance minister , who was possibly concerned the move would be a blow to his fellow citizens ' wallets and their local bartenders ' profits . " we do n't want to surprise the german public with beer getting more expensive , " he told journalists at an eu meeting in luxembourg . besides , the issue of an extra cent here or there is hardly a small matter in a country with more than 1,000 of the eu 's 3,000 breweries .
beer is king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending a german institution steinbrück did n't go so far as to threaten to use germany 's veto to block the plans , a step that his beer-loving neighbors in the czech republic had already taken .
but he made it plain that germany would only approve the tax hikes if beer was excluded from them . " that 's the good news for all those who like to drink a good pilsner , " he said of his protest . steinbrück did , however , make clear that tax rates could gladly be increased on wine and liquor .
after all , they 're already higher in germany than the eu plans foresee .

but nine politicians are currently challenging the law in court . the german parliament is in session , but the chamber remains almost empty . where have all the politicians gone ? their calendars are overbooked .
staying for an entire parliamentary debate takes too much time . lucrative side jobs are what fill up many parliamentarians ' calendars . a particularly spectacular example is christian democrat reinhard göhner , who makes at least double his salary as a parliamentarian from his work as the head of the federal employers association -lrb- bda . -rrb- paying for influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rarity at the bundestag : a full house side jobs also become an issue when looking at the influence of powerful lobbying organizations in germany .
left party parliamentarian gesine lötzsch feels there needs to be more transparency . " the interesting question is , when a parliamentarian has extra income , who ends up influencing the decision making here in the german parliament ?
the mandate of the bundestag is a full-time one , " lötzsch said . a clean image last year , the german parliament decided to polish its reputation by passing a law requiring more transparency .
parliamentarians were prohibited from collecting money for work they do n't do , in an attempt to prevent undo outside influence .
the new law also requires that parliamentarians detail their part-time work and the extra income they receive . but nine members of the bundestag brought a complaint before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , which will be heard on wednesday .
heinrich kolb of the free market liberal fdp is one of the plantiffs .
kolb owns a metal business with his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this a full-time job ? he worries that were he required to report his income , he would also have to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . the policy could have an unintended side effect : self-employed people and entrepreneurs might decide it 's not worth leaving their civilian jobs to enter politics . but gesine lötzsch insists the law 's objective is to keep lobbyists from unduly influencing the political process . " from my point of view , it 's a problem when an attorney works for a large international office and then writes tax legislation .
that has a dramatic effect on the federal budget .
these alliances should be should be known and disclosed beforehand , " lötzsch said . bernd gräßler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine .

more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .

but nine politicians are currently challenging the law in court . the german parliament is in session , but the chamber remains almost empty . where have all the politicians gone ? their calendars are overbooked .
staying for an entire parliamentary debate takes too much time . lucrative side jobs are what fill up many parliamentarians ' calendars . a particularly spectacular example is christian democrat reinhard göhner , who makes at least double his salary as a parliamentarian from his work as the head of the federal employers association -lrb- bda . -rrb- paying for influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rarity at the bundestag : a full house side jobs also become an issue when looking at the influence of powerful lobbying organizations in germany .
left party parliamentarian gesine lötzsch feels there needs to be more transparency . " the interesting question is , when a parliamentarian has extra income , who ends up influencing the decision making here in the german parliament ?
the mandate of the bundestag is a full-time one , " lötzsch said . a clean image last year , the german parliament decided to polish its reputation by passing a law requiring more transparency .
parliamentarians were prohibited from collecting money for work they do n't do , in an attempt to prevent undo outside influence .
the new law also requires that parliamentarians detail their part-time work and the extra income they receive . but nine members of the bundestag brought a complaint before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , which will be heard on wednesday .
heinrich kolb of the free market liberal fdp is one of the plantiffs .
kolb owns a metal business with his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this a full-time job ? he worries that were he required to report his income , he would also have to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . the policy could have an unintended side effect : self-employed people and entrepreneurs might decide it 's not worth leaving their civilian jobs to enter politics . but gesine lötzsch insists the law 's objective is to keep lobbyists from unduly influencing the political process . " from my point of view , it 's a problem when an attorney works for a large international office and then writes tax legislation .
that has a dramatic effect on the federal budget .

"
russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .
there are many projects planned in the energy and automobile sectors . " coming to germany while volkswagen , commerzbank and deutsche post have made splashy announcements about the billions they are investing in russia , russian investors have quietly begun buying their way into the german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have invested heavily in the german energy sector the biggest deals have come in the energy sector .
the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .
russian multi-millionaire rustam aksenenko , who owns a stake in the fashion house escada , said he thinks many russian investors are waiting for a chance to become more visibly involved with german corporations . " from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .
russian entrepreneurs frequently do n't inform german partners about their business activities .
the differences in mentality can create misunderstandings for russians investing in germany and vice versa . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and putin stress economic ties during talks economic issues and the murder of a prominent russian journalist dominated the talks between german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 11.10.2006 germany wants a clear roadmap for eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president barroso attended a german cabinet meeting with chancellor merkel chancellor angela merkel called wednesday for reviving the failed european union constitution but admitted that next year 's german eu presidency would not achieve any breakthrough on the issue . " i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated . " there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated .

"
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : education in europe : a right not a privilege school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on sex education patchy in europe call for european history book as education ministers meet berlin school wants to profit from education education -pipe- 11.10.2006 study reveals education gap in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they getting the education they will need ?
europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 11.10.2006 brutality of nazi health policies on display großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi propaganda promoted aryan ideals while doctors were ordered to carry out plans nazis murdered more than 200,000 physically and mentally disabled people starting in 1933 .
an exhibit at the german hygiene museum traces the history of the nazi regime 's sinister health policies . the high-ceilinged rooms of the dresden museum display swastika-stamped posters praising nazi racial theories that lead to the holocaust . during the nazi era , the german hygiene museum was used to promote mass sterilizations and bans on what were considered interracial marriages .
many of the posters on display in the museum were designed there . so it 's appropriate that the museum would host the exhibit " deadly medicine : creating the master race , " which opens thursday . " the hygiene museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here , " museum director klaus vogel said .
but , he added , " it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless . " exhibit on loan from u.s. museum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curator susan bachrach explains the museum exhibit " deadly medicine " was created by the u.s. holocaust memorial museum and marks the first time one of the museum 's exhibits has traveled abroad . " this close relationship to the topic made it almost a requirement to bring the exhibit here , " vogel said . the exhibit 's opening comes just a week after mass graves were discovered in the western german city of menden .
the grave holds the remains of more than 20 people , many of them children , believed to have been killed by the nazis because they were disabled . thousands of frail children were murdered as part of the third reich 's " euthanasia " program .
children were killed after being deemed unfit to live . explaining murderous racial policies " deadly medicine " traces the history of this systematic effort by nazis to eliminate the " unfit " and create a " master race . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi-era glass man sculpture on display the first section of the exhibit shows how eugenics , a pseudoscience which purported to improve the human species by controlling heredity , became a global movement .
the second part picks up in 1933 , when the nazis began using eugenic theories to justify forced sterilizations and establish a " master race . " the third section explores how the nazis used science as a weapon not only to murder some six million jews in the holocaust , but hundreds of thousands of others who died under euthanasia programs or were otherwise deemed unfit . on sept .
1 , 1939 hitler signed an order for doctors to kill the fatally ill and handicapped .
historians believe that doctors and nurses stood by as nazis shot or gassed some 70,000 people from 1940 to 1941 .
while the program was officially abandoned after protests , the exhibit makes clear the mass killings continued in secret . tens of thousands of people were killed with medication in 1941 after the program had been ended or were simply starved to death . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war ii euthanasia victims found in german mass grave the skeletons of 20 children and five adults believed to be victims of the nazi euthanasia program have been found in a mass grave in western germany .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated . " there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations germany -pipe- 11.10.2006 german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing grapes is a labor of love germany has only a small share of the global wine market , but it is mighty .
but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .

the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .

"
russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .
there are many projects planned in the energy and automobile sectors . " coming to germany while volkswagen , commerzbank and deutsche post have made splashy announcements about the billions they are investing in russia , russian investors have quietly begun buying their way into the german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have invested heavily in the german energy sector the biggest deals have come in the energy sector .
the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .
russian multi-millionaire rustam aksenenko , who owns a stake in the fashion house escada , said he thinks many russian investors are waiting for a chance to become more visibly involved with german corporations . " from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .

" thirty years of the white ring mean 30 years of civic engagement for the victims of crime and violence , " said german chancellor angela merkel on tuesday at a celebration in the german parliament . " that is 30 years of very concrete help by the people for the people that have unexpectedly become victims of violence , " merkel said . merkel praised the organization for the " practical , concrete , quick and unbureaucratic help " which they offered to victims and their families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 11.10.2006 opinion : pressing issues for russian-german relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany must make sure press freedom and human rights abuses remain a central theme in relations with russia , according to dw 's cornelia rabitz . a shadow hung over this year 's petersburg dialogue : the very day on which the murdered journalist anna politovskaya was carried to her grave in moscow , the discussions at the annual german-russian expert forum were dominated by russia 's domestic situation . the critical , independent journalist 's murder as well as the ruthless actions against georgian citizens in moscow bring to mind pressing issues .
they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

"
russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .
there are many projects planned in the energy and automobile sectors . " coming to germany while volkswagen , commerzbank and deutsche post have made splashy announcements about the billions they are investing in russia , russian investors have quietly begun buying their way into the german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have invested heavily in the german energy sector the biggest deals have come in the energy sector .
the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .
russian multi-millionaire rustam aksenenko , who owns a stake in the fashion house escada , said he thinks many russian investors are waiting for a chance to become more visibly involved with german corporations . " from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .
russian entrepreneurs frequently do n't inform german partners about their business activities .
the differences in mentality can create misunderstandings for russians investing in germany and vice versa . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and putin stress economic ties during talks economic issues and the murder of a prominent russian journalist dominated the talks between german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

eu-wide minimum tax rates on alcohol had not been changed in 14 years , it reasoned , and the increase would make a bottle of beer no more than one euro cent -lrb- less than one us cent -rrb- more expensive in germany . but that was obviously one cent too many for germany 's finance minister , who was possibly concerned the move would be a blow to his fellow citizens ' wallets and their local bartenders ' profits . " we do n't want to surprise the german public with beer getting more expensive , " he told journalists at an eu meeting in luxembourg . besides , the issue of an extra cent here or there is hardly a small matter in a country with more than 1,000 of the eu 's 3,000 breweries .
beer is king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending a german institution steinbrück did n't go so far as to threaten to use germany 's veto to block the plans , a step that his beer-loving neighbors in the czech republic had already taken .
but he made it plain that germany would only approve the tax hikes if beer was excluded from them . " that 's the good news for all those who like to drink a good pilsner , " he said of his protest . steinbrück did , however , make clear that tax rates could gladly be increased on wine and liquor .
after all , they 're already higher in germany than the eu plans foresee .
the minister 's insistence ought to ensure that all those who like to drink pilsner - or ale , porter , stout or wheat beer - pick up his tab the next time he fancies a drink . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations germany -pipe- 11.10.2006 german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing grapes is a labor of love germany has only a small share of the global wine market , but it is mighty .
but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .
-lrb- 04.06.2006 -rrb- vintners toast german wine 's popularity as the trade fair prowein continues in düsseldorf , germany 's wine industry has plenty to celebrate : exports are booming .

but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

they are issues regardless of the big business deals that a powerful , energy-rich state under the leadership of a thoroughly self-confident president hopes to make with germany and europe .
issues of basic values , of the way to deal with criticism and an independent press .
the fact that these issues were at least raised at the petersburg dialogue in dresden , that the participants discussed them openly and addressed controversial issues , marked the event . nor could the german chancellor avoid the delicate topics in her meeting with russian president vladimir putin : angela merkel demanded forcefully that the journalist 's murder be investigated and solved .
she could n't have done - or wanted to do - more in public .
vladimir putin promised to do so .
the fact that , at the same time , he tried to minimize the importance of anna politovskaya by describing her as an insignificant person with little influence in russian society showed a particular sort of cynical contempt . certainly calling putin a murderer - as some demonstrators in dresden did - is exaggerated and unjustified .
still , with his policies he created the atmosphere of intimidation and fear that german and russian journalists report about again and again .
it is an atmosphere of disdain for values like freedom , independence of the press , plurality of opinions - an atmosphere in which those who think differently become victims .
even as economic cooperation between germans and russians is excellent , press freedom is and will remain a measure of democratization in russia .
the media is , sure enough , also the topic which consistently sparks arguments between the russian and german sides .
the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

the critical western press is consistently declared one-sided by the authoritative representatives of the kremlin .
the russian delegation at the petersburg dialogue also settled old scores with the german media , spoke of campaign journalism and rejected all criticism . for the record : there is a russia beyond putin 's power apparatus - even though the kremlin does all it can to exclude , bully and discriminate against those who champion human rights and basic rights .
this russia also needs a voice in a country like germany ; it deserves at least as much backing as the big german companies that want to do business in russia . the lack of sensitivity the germans often show is exemplified by the shameful transaction in which russian state monopoly gazprom , in an apparent attempt to polish its tarnished image in the west , will become the main sponsor of german first league soccer club schalke 04 .
in the future , the logo of the company that is to a large extent responsible for the limits to press freedom in russia will bedeck the tops of german athletes .
the russians are right to again and again demand respect and to stress they do n't want to be told what to do by western smart-alecks on high .
but reality shows that when it comes to dealing with civil and basic rights , russia could still learn a lot from the west .
the willingness to do so , however , is non-existent - five years of the petersburg dialogue have n't been able to change that . criticism of russia 's democratic deficit , however , should not be left to a few brave contemporaries or individual groups .
representatives from the business community and society must let no occasion pass to make clear that a free press , a plurality of opinions and working conditions in which journalists need not fear for their lives are all part of modern democratic state .
and not just in moscow but also in the russian countryside .
to consistently bring up these issues remains a challenge for the entire spectrum of german-russian relations .

" i am firmly convinced we need a constitution , " said merkel after talks with european commission president jose manuel barroso about germany 's program for the eu presidency , which berlin will hold during the first half of 2007 . " within our presidency , we 'll certainly not be able to resolve the constitutional issue in all its aspects .
but we 'll aim to bring about fresh awareness among the member countries that we need a european constitution , " merkel said . the eu 's draft constitution was last year rejected by voters in both france and the netherlands .
this torpedoed the project given that all 25 eu members must approve the treaty for it to enter into force . while supporting germany 's ambitious plans to create fresh enthusiasm about a european constitution , barroso told reporters in berlin later on wednesday that it would be an uphill battle to convince citizens of the need for such a treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany faces a tough time as eu president he cautioned that hopes for the presidency under germany - the eu 's biggest economy - should not be exaggerated . " there are great expectations about the german presidency but it is not fair to put all the weight and burden on germany , " barroso said . a constitution worthy of its name dutch leaders have called for the proposed document to be radically reduced in scope and for removal of the name " constitution . "
france , on the other hand , is not expected to make any new moves on the constitution until after french presidential elections in may 2007 . merkel admitted that germany would therefore not be able to clinch any final constitutional deal during its eu presidency which ends on june 30 , 2007 .
instead , merkel said berlin would seek to hammer out a " roadmap " for further moves on the treaty . " we 'll need the treaty before the next european elections -lrb- 2009 -rrb- , " merkel said .
" and we 'll get down to it ambitiously . " the german leader , however , rejected dutch calls for a stripped-down text . " it must be something which deserves the name " constitution " and not merely an institutional set of rules , " merkel said . social issues in a globalized world merkel said she wanted to make sure that future eu guidelines and regulations are better checked with a view to their social impact on ordinary citizens .
while technological progress and competitiveness were of pivotal importance , the german chancellor said it was equally essential to reduce unemployment and safeguard the social achievements of citizens under the conditions of a globalized world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french rejected the proposed eu constitution in 2005 outlining the priorities of the german presidency , merkel also mentioned foreign policy issues that germany would like to see addressed with fresh vigor . " on the foreign policy front , we europeans will certainly have to make a fresh contribution towards the middle east peace process , " merkel said . " i 'm thinking in particular about the eu 's commitment to the roadmap for peace supported by the bloc together with the united nations , the united states and russia , " she said . the eu will hold summits with the united states , russia , japan and canada during the first half of 2007 .
merkel also said she would work on planning an eu-africa summit to be held after the german presidency . the german eu presidency will also hold a special summit in berlin on march 25 , 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the treaty of rome which created the bloc . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu 's door closing for near future the european union does not intend to admit new members " in the foreseeable future " other than those who have already begun adhesion discussions , german chancellor angela merkel said saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold vintners toast german wine 's popularity eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations germany -pipe- 11.10.2006 german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : growing grapes is a labor of love germany has only a small share of the global wine market , but it is mighty .
but up-and-coming wine-makers from surprising places , like china , are giving " old world " winegrowers a run for their money . " life is too short to drink bad wine , " germany 's most famous poet , johann wolfgang von goethe , supposedly once said .
goethe , it should be noted , loved drinking his " grape juice " each evening . like goethe at the turn of the 19th century , more and more germans are drinking wine these days - and replacing the image of germany as a beer-drinking nation .
even in the biggest markets in the world - the united states and japan , more people are sipping away at the nectar of the gods . german vintners have therefore been placing their bets on one wine they do very well : riesling . " riesling continues to be our ' hot ' wine , " said steffen schindler , director of foreign marketing at the german wine institute -lrb- dwi -rrb- in mainz .
" we 've seen that since the beginning of the 1990s , the selection of wines around the world has grown dramatically , so we 've really had to carve a niche for ourselves . " that niche coincides with changes in eating habits . " people are eating lighter , healthier meals , " schindler said .
a light , fruity white wine suits such cuisine - and that 's where the popularity of german riesling comes in .
it fits the bill , according to schindler . tough competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's all in the riesling , say german wine exporters dwi is the national marketing organization for german wines .
wine shops and producers all contribute to dwi 's budget - much like a tax . the dwi decides how german wines are to be marketed on both domestic and foreign markets .
the marketing methods are supplemented by winegrowers ' own private advertising strategies . obviously , part of developing marketing strategies is to know your competitor . while europe still remains the world 's biggest wine producer - with germany producing 3 percent of the world 's wine , vino from so-called " new world " countries such as the united states , argentina , australia and chile has become stiff competition for " old world " - or european - winemakers .
more and more wine is being cultivated in these countries . according to the international organization of vine and wine -lrb- oiv -rrb- , wines from such new world countries now have a 25.5 percent slice of the 80 billion-euro -lrb- $ 100 billion -rrb- global wine market .
that market share was 1.6 percent 20 years ago . the european union 's five largest wine producers - italy , spain , france , germany and portugal - have seen their portion decline from 75 to just over 62 percent in those two decades , according to afp news agency .
at the same time , wine consumption in the strong wine-producing countries like france , italy and spain , has dropped in the past few years - meaning that eu nations are producing more wine than they can sell . the european commission has therefore called for a reform of wine cultivation and trade in eu-member states . " the plan aims to increase the competitiveness of eu wine producers , strengthen the reputation of eu wines and win back market share … , " the commission said in a june statement .
the idea is to reduce quantity and improve quality . to your health ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the grapes are cut from a vine is important german vintners say they can offer those quality wines .
luckily , a tasty riesling can only be made in germany , schindler said . " we have a very particular climate here , " he said .
" chardonnay vines - which are probably the most popular sort right now - can be cultivated virtually anywhere .
that 's not the case with german riesling , or silvaner , which only grow in the unique climate we have in the south and southwest part of the country . " so , while german wine-makers are worried about tough competition from winemakers abroad , even from countries such as china - which is now the world 's seventh-largest producer of wine - they are relying on the popularity and quality of riesling - not just for sales , but also to help them market other german wines abroad . long wine-making history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vineyards along the moselle river still , one should n't underestimate " surprise " wine-growing countries like china , says alexander margaritoff , ceo of hawesko holding ag , one of the world 's largest sellers of wine . " the chinese have been making wine for over 9,000 years , " he said in an interview this month with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung paper , adding that the winegrowing regions of china lie along the same degree of latitude as bordeaux , tuscany and the napa valley . even areas which have normally not been suited for wine cultivation in the past may be so in the future .
global warming is helping along countries such as britain and even the netherlands to make their mark in wine-making .
new types of vines , too , are able to thrive in moderate , rainy climates , not just in sunny , warm ones . that means that other areas could potentially develop climates as " unique " as germany 's - giving rise to more wine cultivators and therefore competitors . a " refined " riesling bildunterschrift : even nuns have their own riesling vineyards along the rhine for now , however , german wine producers are riding the wave of dramatic exports , which rose about 13 percent in the past 12 months . " the most dynamic market for us right now is the united states - there , growth has been around 30 percent in the past year for german wine exports , " schindler said , " and that 's mainly because of riesling . " it is also an affordable wine : a good bottle starts at around $ 10 in the us ; in germany , the same costs around four and a half euros -lrb- $ 5.60 -rrb- , schindler said . perhaps one of biggest reasons for the growth of german wine exports , however , is a change in image . " in the 1990s , we used to try to ' educate ' people abroad about german wine , " schindler said .
" we explained everything from the 13 wine-growing regions here to the different types of grapes and their harvest times . " at some point , we realized that 's all just too complicated for our foreign customers , " schindler said .
" most consumers just want to have fun - they do n't want lectures before they start drinking a glass of wine . " that 's probably what good old goethe thought , too - even six feet under , his mouth may be watering for his favorite elixir . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines vintners in europe are facing major reforms from 2008 that aim to cut production and enable wineries to hold their own against tough competition from competitors in chile and argentina .

an exhibit at the german hygiene museum traces the history of the nazi regime 's sinister health policies . the high-ceilinged rooms of the dresden museum display swastika-stamped posters praising nazi racial theories that lead to the holocaust . during the nazi era , the german hygiene museum was used to promote mass sterilizations and bans on what were considered interracial marriages .
many of the posters on display in the museum were designed there . so it 's appropriate that the museum would host the exhibit " deadly medicine : creating the master race , " which opens thursday . " the hygiene museum was not a criminal institute in the sense that people were killed here , " museum director klaus vogel said .
but , he added , " it helped to shape the idea of which lives were worthy and which were worthless . " exhibit on loan from u.s. museum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : curator susan bachrach explains the museum exhibit " deadly medicine " was created by the u.s. holocaust memorial museum and marks the first time one of the museum 's exhibits has traveled abroad . " this close relationship to the topic made it almost a requirement to bring the exhibit here , " vogel said . the exhibit 's opening comes just a week after mass graves were discovered in the western german city of menden .
the grave holds the remains of more than 20 people , many of them children , believed to have been killed by the nazis because they were disabled . thousands of frail children were murdered as part of the third reich 's " euthanasia " program .
children were killed after being deemed unfit to live . explaining murderous racial policies " deadly medicine " traces the history of this systematic effort by nazis to eliminate the " unfit " and create a " master race . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi-era glass man sculpture on display the first section of the exhibit shows how eugenics , a pseudoscience which purported to improve the human species by controlling heredity , became a global movement .
the second part picks up in 1933 , when the nazis began using eugenic theories to justify forced sterilizations and establish a " master race . " the third section explores how the nazis used science as a weapon not only to murder some six million jews in the holocaust , but hundreds of thousands of others who died under euthanasia programs or were otherwise deemed unfit . on sept .
1 , 1939 hitler signed an order for doctors to kill the fatally ill and handicapped .
historians believe that doctors and nurses stood by as nazis shot or gassed some 70,000 people from 1940 to 1941 .
while the program was officially abandoned after protests , the exhibit makes clear the mass killings continued in secret . tens of thousands of people were killed with medication in 1941 after the program had been ended or were simply starved to death . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war ii euthanasia victims found in german mass grave the skeletons of 20 children and five adults believed to be victims of the nazi euthanasia program have been found in a mass grave in western germany .

russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .

the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .

" from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .

the eu executive proposed adjusting alcohol taxes to reflect inflation .
eu-wide minimum tax rates on alcohol had not been changed in 14 years , it reasoned , and the increase would make a bottle of beer no more than one euro cent -lrb- less than one us cent -rrb- more expensive in germany . but that was obviously one cent too many for germany 's finance minister , who was possibly concerned the move would be a blow to his fellow citizens ' wallets and their local bartenders ' profits . " we do n't want to surprise the german public with beer getting more expensive , " he told journalists at an eu meeting in luxembourg . besides , the issue of an extra cent here or there is hardly a small matter in a country with more than 1,000 of the eu 's 3,000 breweries .
beer is king bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defending a german institution steinbrück did n't go so far as to threaten to use germany 's veto to block the plans , a step that his beer-loving neighbors in the czech republic had already taken .
but he made it plain that germany would only approve the tax hikes if beer was excluded from them . " that 's the good news for all those who like to drink a good pilsner , " he said of his protest . steinbrück did , however , make clear that tax rates could gladly be increased on wine and liquor .
after all , they 're already higher in germany than the eu plans foresee .
the minister 's insistence ought to ensure that all those who like to drink pilsner - or ale , porter , stout or wheat beer - pick up his tab the next time he fancies a drink . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen considers the wisdom of voting in bars it is illegal to drive a vehicle under the influence of alcohol but determining the fate of a city or even a country is another thing .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

europe risks falling behind china and india because governments are doing " painfully little " to improve educational standards on which economic growth depends , said a new study released wednesday . " we are still doing painfully little to take the most necessary step : developing and maintaining the human capital that will determine our future economic prosperity , " said the report prepared by the deutschland denken think tank for the lisbon council for economic competitiveness and social renewal . the report , titled " innovation at work : the european human capital index , " said " policy makers ' willingness to talk up ' innovation " ' was not matched by investment in human capital .
it said europe was engaged with china and india in a " race to the top " in which " delivering ever higher value-added goods and services will determine our ability to generate the wealth needed to preserve our value-driven model for generations to come . " the study lists countries according to a " human capital index " that considers educational facilities in 13 western european countries correlated with employment , productivity and demography .
the findings point to increasing social as well as economic divergence in the european union .
" courting disaster " " some countries - notably germany and italy - are courting disaster by allowing their human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion and chronic underinvestment in education and training , " the study said .
if present trends continue , it warned , " the citizens of germany and italy could find themselves with 50 percent lower gross domestic product per head than people in sweden , ireland or the united kingdom by 2030 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the banner reads " cut " : german education is chronically underfunded it said sweden invests twice as many resources in school , university and adult education as italy or spain . in general , europe spends less on education than its peers in the organization for economic cooperation and development , " the report said .
immigration is the answer it added , " europe 's current competitive edge in a globalized world , its highly educated work force will stay competitive only with higher and better public sector investments .
the most obvious , but by no means easy , solution is immigration , " it said , but by 2030 , " can germans or italians learn to live in a society where every other 20-year-old is a foreigner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on-the-job training is a way to get ahead even though a country has lagged behind in educational investment , it can rapidly reestablish the situation by providing opportunities for adult education and on-job training , which is one of the reasons for the success of the nordic countries , the study said . for example , people between the ages of 44 and 64 in sweden spend an average of 358 hours a year on job-related training , twice as much as the germans and three times as much as the spaniards . sweden also spends 1.7 percent of its gross domestic product on its universities , which is just behind denmark and finland , but almost twice as much as italy . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german youth betrayed by education system the same day president horst köhler described the state of german education as " shameful , " the 15th shell youth study presented in berlin revealed that young people today are increasingly beset by fear of the future .

"
russian president vladimir putin sought the assistance of germany on wednesday in helping to modernize his country 's expanding economy via closer cooperation in the fields of advanced technology and science . at the end of a two-day visit , putin on wednesday traveled to bavaria to meet with politicians and business leaders .
bavaria , germany 's most prosperous state , has about 1,000 firms doing business with russia , could become a ' locomotive ' in helping his country , the president said . bavarian premier edmund stoiber said germany was willing to cooperate with russia in the economic and scientific fields , except where strategic industries were involved . german firms plan to invest more than 1.4 billion euros in russia next year , said klaus mangold , chairman of the powerful eastern committee of the federation of german industries . " russia only has the world 's biggest reserves of natural resources , it is also one of the world 's fast-growing economies and is close to germany geographically , " he said .
" i am confident that german firms will increase their commitment in the years ahead .
there are many projects planned in the energy and automobile sectors . " coming to germany while volkswagen , commerzbank and deutsche post have made splashy announcements about the billions they are investing in russia , russian investors have quietly begun buying their way into the german market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russians have invested heavily in the german energy sector the biggest deals have come in the energy sector .
the russian giant gazprom has partnered with german basf in the wingas group , which supplies numerous german public utilities and large industrial companies with natural gas .
russians also have a block of shares in the vng group , a large gas wholesaler . but russians are eager to invest even more .
after meeting with putin in dresden on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel said she has no doubt they will do so .
it 's hypocritical to speak of free trade without accepting this reality , merkel said . " i can easily understand how the russian businesses see this as a win-win situation and i think more contracts will happen in the future , " she said .
" i understand the need of russia and russian companies to get a foothold here in europe . " keeping a low profile - so far bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and merkel talk business but up to now , most russian investors have remained low key , buying into the fashion industry , cosmetic companies , biotechnology firms and tourism .
russian multi-millionaire rustam aksenenko , who owns a stake in the fashion house escada , said he thinks many russian investors are waiting for a chance to become more visibly involved with german corporations . " from an economic point of view , we can naturally only hope that these relations , which are already on a high level , will continue to develop in the future , " added oliver wieck of the east european committee of german industry . creating stability in russia requires not only political stability but also economic growth , wieck said , adding that russia is profiting from its natural resources and trying to diversify its economy and to become more modern . however , russian investors still have to learn the rules of the game for doing business in germany .
russian entrepreneurs frequently do n't inform german partners about their business activities .
the differences in mentality can create misunderstandings for russians investing in germany and vice versa . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and putin stress economic ties during talks economic issues and the murder of a prominent russian journalist dominated the talks between german chancellor angela merkel and russian president vladimir putin .

but nine politicians are currently challenging the law in court . the german parliament is in session , but the chamber remains almost empty . where have all the politicians gone ? their calendars are overbooked .
staying for an entire parliamentary debate takes too much time . lucrative side jobs are what fill up many parliamentarians ' calendars . a particularly spectacular example is christian democrat reinhard göhner , who makes at least double his salary as a parliamentarian from his work as the head of the federal employers association -lrb- bda . -rrb- paying for influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rarity at the bundestag : a full house side jobs also become an issue when looking at the influence of powerful lobbying organizations in germany .
left party parliamentarian gesine lötzsch feels there needs to be more transparency . " the interesting question is , when a parliamentarian has extra income , who ends up influencing the decision making here in the german parliament ?
the mandate of the bundestag is a full-time one , " lötzsch said . a clean image last year , the german parliament decided to polish its reputation by passing a law requiring more transparency .
parliamentarians were prohibited from collecting money for work they do n't do , in an attempt to prevent undo outside influence .
the new law also requires that parliamentarians detail their part-time work and the extra income they receive . but nine members of the bundestag brought a complaint before the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe , which will be heard on wednesday .
heinrich kolb of the free market liberal fdp is one of the plantiffs .
kolb owns a metal business with his brother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is this a full-time job ? he worries that were he required to report his income , he would also have to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . the policy could have an unintended side effect : self-employed people and entrepreneurs might decide it 's not worth leaving their civilian jobs to enter politics . but gesine lötzsch insists the law 's objective is to keep lobbyists from unduly influencing the political process . " from my point of view , it 's a problem when an attorney works for a large international office and then writes tax legislation .
that has a dramatic effect on the federal budget .
these alliances should be should be known and disclosed beforehand , " lötzsch said . bernd gräßler -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the german problem with corruption a widening match-fixing scandal and revelation of politicians ' corporate salaries have sullied germany 's once clean image .

the new service will be free and give its current writely and spreadsheet packages a unified look and feel .
users need to be online to use the service , which will run in a browser .
many smaller firms are also trying to move into the online office space , where soon they will have to compete with microsoft 's windows live services .
microsoft dominates the market for office software that is installed directly on computers .
rivals like google , however , are offering their software online , on demand , and for free - although some get revenue from advertising placed around the application .
microsoft recently announced that it was planning to launch its own advertising-financed , on-demand suite of office software .
experts believe that it will be based around the company 's basic consumer-oriented software package works .
google tools jonathan rochelle , the product manager for google spreadsheets , told the bbc that the new " google docs & spreadsheets " service will be offered free and without any advertising , at least for now .
the service will allow multiple users to collaborate on documents from different locations .
all documents will be stored on google servers , where they can be searched in the same way as e-mail using the company 's popular gmail service .
mr rochelle denied that the service was a pre-emptive strike against microsoft 's software-on-demand plans .
users had told google that they wanted both products to work the same way , so it was a natural evolution to a " google-looking interface " .
both products were part of the company 's google 's labs offering - services that are still being tested and may contain bugs .
both will now become official google websites .
google 's free software offering includes among other things an online calendar , photo storage , web page builder , and messenger service .
google bought the word processor technology in march 2006 from internet start-up writely .

researchers at dundee university found significant health improvements in the first two months after the march ban .
the results have led to calls for the uk government to speed the introduction of a similar ban south of the border .
but smokers ' rights group forest said the link between passive smoking and ill health had not been proven .
the team from the university 's asthma and allergy research group began testing bar workers in and around dundee in february , a month before the ban came into force .
this study provides compelling evidence that making workplaces smoke free can have a significant and speedy impact on people 's health peter hollins british heart foundation using a series of indicators , they established symptoms attributable to passive smoking , measuring lung function and inflammation in the bloodstream .
testing volunteers a month later and then again in may , the researchers were not only able to back up anecdotal evidence of a general feeling of wellbeing but scientifically establish significant improvements in people 's health .
daniel menzies , from the research group , said that in the two months following the introduction of the ban , the number who showed smoke-related symptoms fell from more than 80 % to fewer than half .
the team also recorded reductions in levels of nicotine in the bloodstream and breathing tests showed improvement in lung function of as much as 10 % .
the researchers measured the lung function of bar staff " our study shows that , across a number of health indicators , positive changes were evident even in the first two months following the introduction of the smoking ban , which is a very rapid change , " said dr menzies .
shelagh matthews , an asthmatic who works as the bar manager at dundee city centre pub the phoenix , said she had used her inhaler less frequently since the ban .
" the smoke was something that definitely did have an effect , though perhaps we did n't realise how much of an effect until it was gone , " she said .
" i do actually feel the difference . "
neil rafferty , from the freedom organisation for the right to enjoy smoking tobacco -lrb- forest -rrb- , questioned the medical basis for the research .
the anti-smoking lobby are still making exaggerated claims about passive smoking , meanwhile people are being denied choice neil rafferty forest mr rafferty said it diverted attention from the issue of people 's right to choose under a system of smoking and non-smoking venues .
he said : " many people who work in pubs are smokers , many of whom like to have a cigarette during their shift and many of whom are n't really concerned about the issue of passive smoking .
" the science on passive smoking is still very inconclusive , the anti-smoking lobby are still making exaggerated claims about passive smoking , meanwhile people are being denied choice . "
following the results of the study , which have been published in the journal of the american medical association , the british heart foundation called on prime minister tony blair to name a precise date for the introduction of an english ban .
chief executive peter hollins said : " this study provides compelling evidence that making workplaces smoke free can have a significant and speedy impact on people 's health . "

canterbury city council has agreed to release funds so that architects can work on designs next year for the marlowe theatre 's £ 24m overhaul .
the theatre is housed in a 1920s cinema but soon only the shell will remain .
council chief executive colin carmichael said the building would look " completely different " .
he said the council was set to put £ 9m into the plan overall and would also seek funds from trusts and private organisations .
bars and restaurants he said the marlowe theatre 's fly tower made it the second tallest building in the city after the cathedral .
the council chief said the theatre would close for 18 months , but stage productions would still take place in the city .
the end result would provide a theatre with 200 additional seats , refigured in a semi-circle instead of the current straight-down-the-line rake .
he said there would be a second performance space and " all of the facilities you would expect in a theatre " , including a proper box office , bars and restaurants .
mr carmichael said the shell of the building - the walls and the stage house - would remain because there was a limit to what it could stand in terms of refurbishment , but everything else would be extra .

canterbury city council has agreed to release funds so that architects can work on designs next year for the marlowe theatre 's £ 24m overhaul .
the theatre is housed in a 1920s cinema but soon only the shell will remain .
council chief executive colin carmichael said the building would look " completely different " .
he said the council was set to put £ 9m into the plan overall and would also seek funds from trusts and private organisations .
bars and restaurants he said the marlowe theatre 's fly tower made it the second tallest building in the city after the cathedral .
the council chief said the theatre would close for 18 months , but stage productions would still take place in the city .
the end result would provide a theatre with 200 additional seats , refigured in a semi-circle instead of the current straight-down-the-line rake .
he said there would be a second performance space and " all of the facilities you would expect in a theatre " , including a proper box office , bars and restaurants .
mr carmichael said the shell of the building - the walls and the stage house - would remain because there was a limit to what it could stand in terms of refurbishment , but everything else would be extra .

nitin desai , chair of the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- , set up by the un , warned that concerns over the net 's future could lead to separation .
" people are concerned about whether the system we have now will also work five years from now , " he said .
mr desai was speaking at a conference in london to discuss the net .
the conference was organised by nominet , the uk body in charge of domain names ending .uk , ahead of the first-ever internet governance forum , a global gathering of stakeholders in athens later this month .
if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net nitin desai mr desai said there were tensions about the future regulation of the net and over specific issues such as international domain names .
" there are concerns over regulation as the internet , telephony and commerce come together , " he said .
" if i look at the internet in five years from now there are going to be very , very , very more internet users in asia than europe or america .
" there will be more chinese web pages than english pages .
the igf conference in athens will debate the future net " the types of uses for the internet in india and china are very different from western countries - they are not commerce or media ; they are essentially public service applications . "
the internet was increasingly being shaped by companies and organisations at the " edges " and not by government , public sector bodies and regulators , he said .
this was concerning some countries who wanted more involvement in the development of the net .
" these are the reasons these entities - government and private sector - feel they need to be reassured that the system they are relying on is secure , safe and reliable - that they can not be suddenly thrown out of that system by some attack , " said mr desai .
he said the chinese government was concerned that users still had to type webpage addresses using latin characters even when the pages were in chinese .
" a large proportion of the internet users in china do not know the latin alphabet .
why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ?
howard williams , world bank " there are concerns about internationalised domain names in some countries who feel the debate is not moving fast enough . "
he warned : " i think this is one of the key issues and if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net . "
" there 's a point at which the chinese will say ' we have to have domain names in chinese characters ' and they will set up an independent system . "
other speakers at the conference felt that in some ways a " balkanised " internet was inevitable .
professor howard williams , who works with the world bank , said the debate around future regulation of the web rested on the assumption there would be a single web in the future .
' net neutrality ' " why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ? "
prof williams said balkanisation was " happening already " .
" in the us the issue of net neutrality raises the prospect of a different sort of web , " he said .
earlier this year a us senate committee approved a bill which lets internet service provides provide some customers with preferential services such as bandwidth and speed .
" net neutrality " campaigners attacked the plan , saying there should be equal access for all web users .
chinyelu onwurah of uk super regulator ofcom said the impact of balkanisation would depend on the effect it had on consumer choice .
she said : " if balkanisation refers to islands of connectivity that have no inter-connectivity between them then clearly that is a bad thing and limits the choice and reach for consumers .
" but if it refers to differentiation and different levels of protection , of functionality and speed , and relates to choice , then that is a positive thing . "
the igf has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome nitin desai david harrington , of business group the communications management association , said cultural differences would " inevitably balkanise the net " .
" that 's been the case since the net was available commercially ; it 's a matter of degrees , " he said .
mr desai said the igf would be the opportunity to discuss many of these issues .
but he reminded delegates at the london conference that the igf was not a " decision-making body " .
he said : " no-one wants to duplicate a telecoms-type regulator on the internet .
it 's a multi-stakeholder exercise .
" for this reason the igf has been created .
the forum has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome .
" but it 's not a decision-making body .
we have no members so we have no power to make decision . "

nitin desai , chair of the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- , set up by the un , warned that concerns over the net 's future could lead to separation .
" people are concerned about whether the system we have now will also work five years from now , " he said .
mr desai was speaking at a conference in london to discuss the net .
the conference was organised by nominet , the uk body in charge of domain names ending .uk , ahead of the first-ever internet governance forum , a global gathering of stakeholders in athens later this month .
if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net nitin desai mr desai said there were tensions about the future regulation of the net and over specific issues such as international domain names .
" there are concerns over regulation as the internet , telephony and commerce come together , " he said .
" if i look at the internet in five years from now there are going to be very , very , very more internet users in asia than europe or america .
" there will be more chinese web pages than english pages .
the igf conference in athens will debate the future net " the types of uses for the internet in india and china are very different from western countries - they are not commerce or media ; they are essentially public service applications . "
the internet was increasingly being shaped by companies and organisations at the " edges " and not by government , public sector bodies and regulators , he said .
this was concerning some countries who wanted more involvement in the development of the net .
" these are the reasons these entities - government and private sector - feel they need to be reassured that the system they are relying on is secure , safe and reliable - that they can not be suddenly thrown out of that system by some attack , " said mr desai .
he said the chinese government was concerned that users still had to type webpage addresses using latin characters even when the pages were in chinese .
" a large proportion of the internet users in china do not know the latin alphabet .
why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ?
howard williams , world bank " there are concerns about internationalised domain names in some countries who feel the debate is not moving fast enough . "
he warned : " i think this is one of the key issues and if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net . "
" there 's a point at which the chinese will say ' we have to have domain names in chinese characters ' and they will set up an independent system . "
other speakers at the conference felt that in some ways a " balkanised " internet was inevitable .
professor howard williams , who works with the world bank , said the debate around future regulation of the web rested on the assumption there would be a single web in the future .
' net neutrality ' " why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ? "
prof williams said balkanisation was " happening already " .
" in the us the issue of net neutrality raises the prospect of a different sort of web , " he said .
earlier this year a us senate committee approved a bill which lets internet service provides provide some customers with preferential services such as bandwidth and speed .
" net neutrality " campaigners attacked the plan , saying there should be equal access for all web users .
chinyelu onwurah of uk super regulator ofcom said the impact of balkanisation would depend on the effect it had on consumer choice .
she said : " if balkanisation refers to islands of connectivity that have no inter-connectivity between them then clearly that is a bad thing and limits the choice and reach for consumers .
" but if it refers to differentiation and different levels of protection , of functionality and speed , and relates to choice , then that is a positive thing . "
the igf has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome nitin desai david harrington , of business group the communications management association , said cultural differences would " inevitably balkanise the net " .
" that 's been the case since the net was available commercially ; it 's a matter of degrees , " he said .
mr desai said the igf would be the opportunity to discuss many of these issues .
but he reminded delegates at the london conference that the igf was not a " decision-making body " .
he said : " no-one wants to duplicate a telecoms-type regulator on the internet .
it 's a multi-stakeholder exercise .
" for this reason the igf has been created .
the forum has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome .
" but it 's not a decision-making body .
we have no members so we have no power to make decision . "

nitin desai , chair of the internet governance forum -lrb- igf -rrb- , set up by the un , warned that concerns over the net 's future could lead to separation .
" people are concerned about whether the system we have now will also work five years from now , " he said .
mr desai was speaking at a conference in london to discuss the net .
the conference was organised by nominet , the uk body in charge of domain names ending .uk , ahead of the first-ever internet governance forum , a global gathering of stakeholders in athens later this month .
if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net nitin desai mr desai said there were tensions about the future regulation of the net and over specific issues such as international domain names .
" there are concerns over regulation as the internet , telephony and commerce come together , " he said .
" if i look at the internet in five years from now there are going to be very , very , very more internet users in asia than europe or america .
" there will be more chinese web pages than english pages .
the igf conference in athens will debate the future net " the types of uses for the internet in india and china are very different from western countries - they are not commerce or media ; they are essentially public service applications . "
the internet was increasingly being shaped by companies and organisations at the " edges " and not by government , public sector bodies and regulators , he said .
this was concerning some countries who wanted more involvement in the development of the net .
" these are the reasons these entities - government and private sector - feel they need to be reassured that the system they are relying on is secure , safe and reliable - that they can not be suddenly thrown out of that system by some attack , " said mr desai .
he said the chinese government was concerned that users still had to type webpage addresses using latin characters even when the pages were in chinese .
" a large proportion of the internet users in china do not know the latin alphabet .
why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ?
howard williams , world bank " there are concerns about internationalised domain names in some countries who feel the debate is not moving fast enough . "
he warned : " i think this is one of the key issues and if we do n't address it with sufficient vigour we will get a balkanisation of the net . "
" there 's a point at which the chinese will say ' we have to have domain names in chinese characters ' and they will set up an independent system . "
other speakers at the conference felt that in some ways a " balkanised " internet was inevitable .
professor howard williams , who works with the world bank , said the debate around future regulation of the web rested on the assumption there would be a single web in the future .
' net neutrality ' " why would the technology we have at the moment be the ubiquitous technology across the world in the future ? "
prof williams said balkanisation was " happening already " .
" in the us the issue of net neutrality raises the prospect of a different sort of web , " he said .
earlier this year a us senate committee approved a bill which lets internet service provides provide some customers with preferential services such as bandwidth and speed .
" net neutrality " campaigners attacked the plan , saying there should be equal access for all web users .
chinyelu onwurah of uk super regulator ofcom said the impact of balkanisation would depend on the effect it had on consumer choice .
she said : " if balkanisation refers to islands of connectivity that have no inter-connectivity between them then clearly that is a bad thing and limits the choice and reach for consumers .
" but if it refers to differentiation and different levels of protection , of functionality and speed , and relates to choice , then that is a positive thing . "
the igf has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome nitin desai david harrington , of business group the communications management association , said cultural differences would " inevitably balkanise the net " .
" that 's been the case since the net was available commercially ; it 's a matter of degrees , " he said .
mr desai said the igf would be the opportunity to discuss many of these issues .
but he reminded delegates at the london conference that the igf was not a " decision-making body " .
he said : " no-one wants to duplicate a telecoms-type regulator on the internet .
it 's a multi-stakeholder exercise .
" for this reason the igf has been created .
the forum has no membership , it 's an open door , a town hall , all views are welcome .
" but it 's not a decision-making body .
we have no members so we have no power to make decision . "

when richard griffiths and the rest of the cast of the history boys began rehearsing alan bennett 's play in early 2004 , they could hardly have imagined it would lead to a glitzy royal film premiere in london 's leicester square .
but as last week 's event proved , this critically acclaimed story of northern grammar school boys preparing for their oxbridge entrance exams has had a charmed life .
since opening at london 's national theatre in may 2004 , it has been performed in hong kong , new zealand and on bbc radio 3 .
it also became the toast of broadway , winning six prizes at the 2006 tony awards as well as a host of lesser awards .
with the end of the play 's new york run and the film version arriving in uk cinemas , the time has come to move on to other things and - to quote griffiths ' character - " pass the parcel " to other performers .
" it really is the end of an era , " says 59-year-old griffiths , who plays avuncular general studies teacher hector .
sentimental " nearly 500 shows , every one a full house .
amazing , is n't it ?
" the management did very well out of it .
i hope the film does well too . "
" it 's a fantastic way to end an incredible journey , " agrees actor samuel barnett , who plays the youngest ' history boy ' , posner .
" i almost do n't think of it as a movie .
it 's a celebration of three years of work . "
with nicholas hytner once more in the director 's chair , the dream scenario is that the film version enjoys the same success as 1994 's the madness of king george .
like the history boys , that piece began as an alan bennett play directed by hytner that premiered at the national .
for actor dominic cooper , though , the film in which he appears as teenage lothario dakin has a more sentimental significance .
pragmatic " the bad thing about theatre is it 's just a memory in the minds of the few people who saw it , " he tells the bbc news website .
" with this , we 've got it forever . "
with a role in forthcoming british comedy starter for ten , cooper is already seeking fresher pastures .
still , he and his fellow cast members regard the stage production of the history boys currently touring the uk with a degree of ambivalence .
" it 's odd having to hand over the role , " he concedes .
" we were the characters from the beginning and alan developed them around us . "
" i 'm sad about leaving the play behind , but i 'm more sad about the fact i wo n't get to work with these people again , " adds barnett .
actor jamie parker , though , takes a more pragmatic view in keeping with his role as loquacious pupil scripps .
" nothing will get you straining at the leash creatively more than doing the same material for this amount of time , " he says .
the history boys film is released on 13 october .
the play 's touring production is currently at the new theatre in hull .

the film reunites the stage play 's eight original ' history boys ' when richard griffiths and the rest of the cast of the history boys began rehearsing alan bennett 's play in early 2004 , they could hardly have imagined it would lead to a glitzy royal film premiere in london 's leicester square .
but as last week 's event proved , this critically acclaimed story of northern grammar school boys preparing for their oxbridge entrance exams has had a charmed life .
since opening at london 's national theatre in may 2004 , it has been performed in hong kong , new zealand and on bbc radio 3 .
it also became the toast of broadway , winning six prizes at the 2006 tony awards as well as a host of lesser awards .
with the end of the play 's new york run and the film version arriving in uk cinemas , the time has come to move on to other things and - to quote griffiths ' character - " pass the parcel " to other performers .
" it really is the end of an era , " says 59-year-old griffiths , who plays avuncular general studies teacher hector .

like the history boys , that piece began as an alan bennett play directed by hytner that premiered at the national .
for actor dominic cooper , though , the film in which he appears as teenage lothario dakin has a more sentimental significance .
pragmatic " the bad thing about theatre is it 's just a memory in the minds of the few people who saw it , " he tells the bbc news website .
" with this , we 've got it forever . "
