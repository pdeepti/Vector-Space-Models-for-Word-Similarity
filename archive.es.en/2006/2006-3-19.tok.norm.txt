program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2006 opposition accuses lukashenko of manipulating belarus vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko is expected to be handed a third term as president belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko looked set for landslide re-election sunday amid opposition claims of vote-rigging and fear of violence after authorities vowed to crush protests . polls opened at 8:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .
he enjoys support in large segments of belarusian society for ensuring that pensions are paid on time and maintaining economic stability . however , he also has the benefit of a powerful propaganda machine that was in full swing on election morning , with state television airing dozens of interviews with experts and ordinary people praising the fairness of the election system and success of lukashenko 's rule . the central electoral commission chairwoman , lidiya yermoshina , told state television : " there have been no complaints from voters , only congratulatory telegrams . " the two other candidates taking part in the election are opposition leader alexander kozulin of the social democratic party and liberal democratic leader sergei gaidukevich , regarded as a mild critic of lukashenko . opposition candidates restricted in campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader milinkevich has a certain popular support but , like milinkevich , they have been allowed just one hour of television air time each in the whole election campaign , and were not expected to garner significant numbers of votes . one voter , yelena lisenkova , 76 , praised lukashenko for " getting rid of all the drunks who did n't want to work . " " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .
" all normal-thinking , hopeful people are voting for him .
people are tired of living in the past . " to avoid a run-off vote in belarus , a candidate must win at least 50 percent of votes cast .
at least half of the approximately seven million registered voters must take part for the election to be valid . the presidential term in office is five years . banned observers stage protests on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the belarus opposition protested at the border observers who were barred entry to belarus for the presidential elections took part in a protest at lithuania 's border with belarus , one of the organizers of the action said . some 80 lithuanians , poles and scandinavians rallied at medininkai border post for some two hours starting at midday , tomas tomilinas , a board member of the non-governmental organization , united centre of initiative for belarus , told reporters . " we came here to express our solidarity with the belarus people who seek freedom , " rasa rastauskiene , one of six lithuanian lawmakers who this week were refused visas by the belarus authorities , said . " we do not want belarus to be separated from europe .
the belarus nation belongs to europe and the lukashenko regime is lowering a new iron curtain between belarus and the european union , " rastauskiene added . all six lithuanian legislators who this week were barred entry to belarus took part in the protest , as did four members of scandinavian non-government organization silba , who were expelled from belarus this week for alleged " illegal activities . " tomilinas said similar actions also took place in poland and ukraine . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls for more concrete eu action on belarus gather pace former and current eastern european liberal leaders called on the eu friday to support the liberal opposition candidates challenging belarusian president alexander lukashenko in a vote they said was certain to be fixed .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .
he enjoys support in large segments of belarusian society for ensuring that pensions are paid on time and maintaining economic stability . however , he also has the benefit of a powerful propaganda machine that was in full swing on election morning , with state television airing dozens of interviews with experts and ordinary people praising the fairness of the election system and success of lukashenko 's rule . the central electoral commission chairwoman , lidiya yermoshina , told state television : " there have been no complaints from voters , only congratulatory telegrams . " the two other candidates taking part in the election are opposition leader alexander kozulin of the social democratic party and liberal democratic leader sergei gaidukevich , regarded as a mild critic of lukashenko . opposition candidates restricted in campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader milinkevich has a certain popular support but , like milinkevich , they have been allowed just one hour of television air time each in the whole election campaign , and were not expected to garner significant numbers of votes . one voter , yelena lisenkova , 76 , praised lukashenko for " getting rid of all the drunks who did n't want to work . " " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .
" all normal-thinking , hopeful people are voting for him .
people are tired of living in the past . " to avoid a run-off vote in belarus , a candidate must win at least 50 percent of votes cast .
at least half of the approximately seven million registered voters must take part for the election to be valid . the presidential term in office is five years . banned observers stage protests on border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the belarus opposition protested at the border observers who were barred entry to belarus for the presidential elections took part in a protest at lithuania 's border with belarus , one of the organizers of the action said . some 80 lithuanians , poles and scandinavians rallied at medininkai border post for some two hours starting at midday , tomas tomilinas , a board member of the non-governmental organization , united centre of initiative for belarus , told reporters . " we came here to express our solidarity with the belarus people who seek freedom , " rasa rastauskiene , one of six lithuanian lawmakers who this week were refused visas by the belarus authorities , said . " we do not want belarus to be separated from europe .
the belarus nation belongs to europe and the lukashenko regime is lowering a new iron curtain between belarus and the european union , " rastauskiene added . all six lithuanian legislators who this week were barred entry to belarus took part in the protest , as did four members of scandinavian non-government organization silba , who were expelled from belarus this week for alleged " illegal activities .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .
he enjoys support in large segments of belarusian society for ensuring that pensions are paid on time and maintaining economic stability . however , he also has the benefit of a powerful propaganda machine that was in full swing on election morning , with state television airing dozens of interviews with experts and ordinary people praising the fairness of the election system and success of lukashenko 's rule . the central electoral commission chairwoman , lidiya yermoshina , told state television : " there have been no complaints from voters , only congratulatory telegrams . " the two other candidates taking part in the election are opposition leader alexander kozulin of the social democratic party and liberal democratic leader sergei gaidukevich , regarded as a mild critic of lukashenko . opposition candidates restricted in campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader milinkevich has a certain popular support but , like milinkevich , they have been allowed just one hour of television air time each in the whole election campaign , and were not expected to garner significant numbers of votes . one voter , yelena lisenkova , 76 , praised lukashenko for " getting rid of all the drunks who did n't want to work . " " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .
" all normal-thinking , hopeful people are voting for him .
people are tired of living in the past . " to avoid a run-off vote in belarus , a candidate must win at least 50 percent of votes cast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2006 opposition accuses lukashenko of manipulating belarus vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko is expected to be handed a third term as president belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko looked set for landslide re-election sunday amid opposition claims of vote-rigging and fear of violence after authorities vowed to crush protests . polls opened at 8:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .

" on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful .

" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .

-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's .

his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .

" the two other candidates taking part in the election are opposition leader alexander kozulin of the social democratic party and liberal democratic leader sergei gaidukevich , regarded as a mild critic of lukashenko . opposition candidates restricted in campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader milinkevich has a certain popular support but , like milinkevich , they have been allowed just one hour of television air time each in the whole election campaign , and were not expected to garner significant numbers of votes . one voter , yelena lisenkova , 76 , praised lukashenko for " getting rid of all the drunks who did n't want to work . " " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .
" all normal-thinking , hopeful people are voting for him .
people are tired of living in the past . " to avoid a run-off vote in belarus , a candidate must win at least 50 percent of votes cast .

a total of 34 police officers and 18 demonstrators were injured , though none seriously . violent incidents were reported on the fringes of marches in other cities , including bordeaux , clermont-ferrand and grenoble . violence marrs day of widespread peaceful demonstrations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence erupted again on the streets of paris saturday the disturbances marred a day that was hailed by unions as a major success in their campaign against the cpe , and on sunday leaders vowed to step up the pressure in the days ahead if the youth jobs contract is not withdrawn by the government . campaign organizers were to meet monday afternoon to assess the government 's response , with the threat of a fresh escalation via a general strike now being openly brandished . " of course it is an ultimatum .
the government and the president have effectively 48 hours to decide , " rene valadon of the workers ' force -lrb- fo -rrb- union said . " obviously we have to maintain the mobilization .
for it to work we need an appeal from several unions for an inter-professional strike day , " the fo 's general-secretary jean-claude mailly told le journal du dimanche newspaper .

conditions are such that it should be a success . " an open-ended contract for under 26 year-olds that can be terminated without justification in the first two years , the cpe is meant to bring down france 's chronically high youth unemployment rate by offering employers greater flexibility . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the labor plan was supposed to eradicate rioting not cause it conceived in the wake of last november 's riots in high-immigration suburbs - where less than one young person in two has a job - it was approved by parliament ten days ago as part of a wider law on equal opportunities . but the centre-right government has been stymied by a growing wave of opposition , with unions , students and left-wing parties calling the cpe a charter for employer exploitation and a breach of france 's hard-won labor rights . repeated street demonstrations have been accompanied by strikes and sit-ins at most of the country 's 84 universities .
the sorbonne - centre of the may 1968 uprising - has been the scene of several nights of clashes with police after it was closed by the authorities . prime minister seemingly adrift in sea of chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin seems at a loss villepin - who has made implementation of the youth contract a personal mission - was sunday closeted with advisers , amid widespread predictions that he will offer new adjustments to the text of the law without altering its essence . on saturday evening government spokesman jean-francois cope again appealed for dialogue , and said : " it is possible to work on certain improvements , certain formulae to reinforce guarantees for the young . " president jacques chirac has also urged the two sides to open talks , but an increasingly buoyant opposition says that abandonment of the cpe is a precondition for negotiations . the conflict over the youth jobs plan has turned into villepin 's most serious crisis since he took office ten months ago , and commentators agreed that his political future is at stake .
the prime minister has been named as a possible contender to replace chirac in next year 's presidential election . the latest polls show that 68 percent of the public is opposed to the cpe , while villepin 's satisfaction rating has fallen to 37 percent - down 15 points in two months . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de riots in france as job protests heat up police have detained nearly 300 people after students marches turned violent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2006 opposition accuses lukashenko of manipulating belarus vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko is expected to be handed a third term as president belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko looked set for landslide re-election sunday amid opposition claims of vote-rigging and fear of violence after authorities vowed to crush protests . polls opened at 8:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health .

" " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.03.2006 opposition accuses lukashenko of manipulating belarus vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukashenko is expected to be handed a third term as president belarus ' authoritarian president alexander lukashenko looked set for landslide re-election sunday amid opposition claims of vote-rigging and fear of violence after authorities vowed to crush protests . polls opened at 8:00 a.m.
-lrb- 0700 utc -rrb- and were to close at 8:00 p.m.
-lrb- 1900 utc -rrb- .
turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .
lukashenko can only keep power by force . " demonstrations against regime to be " crushed " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko supporters look forward to five more years lukashenko , 51 , has vowed to crush any demonstration , warning that authorities will " break the neck immediately - like a duckling 's . "
his kgb security service claims protestors are part of a western-backed coup plot and could be executed or imprisoned for life as " terrorists . " on saturday , many mobile phone subscribers in belarus received an anonymous text message warning of " bloodshed " in minsk and urging them to " watch out for life and health . " the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .
russia supports belarus ' growing economy with cheap energy supplies and the two countries are also in continuing talks on forming a " union state . " two-term limit abandoned leaving president free to reign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko is omnipotent in belarus sunday 's vote is a landmark for lukashenko , as it follows the abolition of a two-term limit on holding the presidency at a controversial referendum in 2004 .
he enjoys support in large segments of belarusian society for ensuring that pensions are paid on time and maintaining economic stability . however , he also has the benefit of a powerful propaganda machine that was in full swing on election morning , with state television airing dozens of interviews with experts and ordinary people praising the fairness of the election system and success of lukashenko 's rule . the central electoral commission chairwoman , lidiya yermoshina , told state television : " there have been no complaints from voters , only congratulatory telegrams . " the two other candidates taking part in the election are opposition leader alexander kozulin of the social democratic party and liberal democratic leader sergei gaidukevich , regarded as a mild critic of lukashenko . opposition candidates restricted in campaigning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition leader milinkevich has a certain popular support but , like milinkevich , they have been allowed just one hour of television air time each in the whole election campaign , and were not expected to garner significant numbers of votes . one voter , yelena lisenkova , 76 , praised lukashenko for " getting rid of all the drunks who did n't want to work . " " we need to get rid of the opposition so they do n't organize riots , and do n't interfere in our state , " she said after casting her ballot in minsk . however , another voter , who said he was too scared to give his name , told reporters he and his family were voting for milinkevich .

turnout passed the minimum 50 percent requirement for the polling to be declared valid within three hours , officials said .
" already more than 50 percent of people registered on voter lists have taken part , " nikolai lozovik , deputy chairman of the central electoral commission , said on state television . lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for 12 years , is widely expected to defeat his three opponents , winning a third term as leader of the ex-soviet republic of 10 million people . however , the main opposition candidate , alexander milinkevich , accuses lukashenko of planning " total falsification " in the wake of a campaign that saw the opposition almost entirely denied media access and hundreds of activists detained . milinkevich , a 58-year-old physicist , repeated his call for a peaceful demonstration in central minsk after polls close , despite repeated warnings from the authorities . " i 've invited those who are for change in our country to go to the square , " he said after casting his vote in the capital .
" if there are provocations , the responsibility will be with the authorities .
we are peaceful . " the opposition appears to have little chance of mirroring the recent people-power revolutions that swept away entrenched regimes in georgia , kyrgyzstan and ukraine after rigged elections . both opposition candidates complained sunday that polling was being manipulated in favor of lukashenko .
milinkevich said his activists were not being allowed to observe voting in polling stations .
" they chase them out , " he told journalists . he also described as " a major violation " the frequent broadcast on state television of exit polls by pro-government institutes , showing lukashenko to be cruising to crushing victory .
such polls " put pressure on voters on election day , " he said . milinkevich accused authorities of " frightening people " through frequent statements indicating that any protest against the election results will result in bloodshed . another opposition candidate , alexander kozulin , said the result would be fixed .
" we know an order has been given for lukashenko to get 80 percent .
if this is confirmed , we will ask for a recount .

" the confrontation in belarus , sandwiched between the european union and russia , is also part of a battle for influence between the west and moscow in the ex-soviet territories . us president george w. bush has described belarus as " the last dictatorship in europe " and western powers accuse lukashenko of rigging sunday 's vote by stifling independent media , arresting activists and manipulating the electoral apparatus . however , moscow has warned the west not to meddle .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- panorama -pipe- iraqis torn between fear and uncertainty bbc news / panorama graphics version bbc sport home sunday , 19 march 2006 , 07:22 gmt iraqis torn between fear and uncertainty by jane corbin bbc panorama , basra bringing our boys home ?
your comments three years ago , as british troops swept into basra , in southern iraq , the british were welcomed as liberators .
a group of iraqis crowded around us - british journalists - to praise tony blair and broke into spontaneous applause .
the south had been ruthlessly oppressed and thousands of people had been killed by saddam hussein and his baath party apparatus after the attempted shia uprising in 1991 .
today , the atmosphere on the streets has changed .
i sensed that the majority of people are torn - they want the british to leave after three years of occupation but they are also fearful of what might happen when they go .
on 22 february , the day that sectarian violence swept the country following the attack by sunni insurgents on the shia golden shrine at samarra , the panorama team was trapped in the most exposed british base in basra - right in the heart of the city . "
a voice came over the tannoy saying that the base was under attack " watch corbin 's video dairies we had filmed with this unit , zulu company of the royal fusiliers , three years before when they took over a section of the city and supplied desperate people with water .
now we could only watch as massive demonstrations , called by shia religious leaders , began forming outside the walls of the base .
major john stott was under orders to keep a low profile but his men started preparing their riot gear .
the unspoken fear was what might happen if the thousands of shocked and angry people outside turned on the british base .
in the event , the demonstration passed off peacefully if noisily - the banners railed against the americans and israelis but not the british .
mutual respect iraqis here told us the british were still tolerated - even welcome in some quarters because they had generally behaved in a restrained way towards them and respected their local culture .
there had been some exceptions - the incident where soldiers had been filmed beating up iraqi youths in the town of al-amara had caused anger and political repercussions across the south .
but out on the streets of basra on night patrol with maj stott and his team , i found no open hostility and local youths even chatted with the soldiers about british football .
the british soldiers were bound for the local police station where the aim was to try to get the police to go on a joint patrol .
it was a test of whether the police would abide by the boycott of the british , which the provincial council had instigated after the arrest of alleged corrupt elements in the basra police force .
maj stott was encouraged when the local police agreed to join his soldiers but two minutes later a message was sent to say they had received orders from on high and the patrol was off .
these are the frustrations the british are experiencing three years on as new democratically elected leaders assert their right to rule the city .
criminal gangs in other ways my recent experience in basra contrasted sharply with three years ago .
in 2003 , i had driven all over the city at will - welcome in almost all quarters .
today , westerners who value their own safety can only travel in armoured vehicles and helicopters . "
the physical face of the city has hardly changed at all , stagnant water and filthy rubbish clog the streets " key roads are now the haunt of criminal gangs intent on kidnap and there is the ever present danger of ieds - improvised explosive devices - planted by militia elements who are the main opposition to the british in the south .
the physical face of the city has hardly changed at all , stagnant water and filthy rubbish clog the streets and there is extreme poverty in the shia slums .
the water supply has improved but there are still electricity shortages .
the infrastructure of basra is wrecked and it will take huge capital investment and many years to improve it .
iraq has the oil revenues to pay for it but so far lacks the efficient and clean governance that would make that possible .
iraqis complain that corruption is still rife and the police force , hated in the saddam hussein years is still not a force they can trust .
the british have begun the process of drawing down their 8,000 strong force in the south .
there will be 800 fewer by the end of may .
the big question is will there still be a need for the british army in the south in three years time ?
the iraqi prime minister , ibrahim jaafari told me that he could not ask the multinational forces to leave his country until the iraqis were strong enough to protect themselves .
what happens to basra and the south in the next three years is still very much an open question .

your comments three years ago , as british troops swept into basra , in southern iraq , the british were welcomed as liberators .
a group of iraqis crowded around us - british journalists - to praise tony blair and broke into spontaneous applause .
the south had been ruthlessly oppressed and thousands of people had been killed by saddam hussein and his baath party apparatus after the attempted shia uprising in 1991 .
today , the atmosphere on the streets has changed .
i sensed that the majority of people are torn - they want the british to leave after three years of occupation but they are also fearful of what might happen when they go .
on 22 february , the day that sectarian violence swept the country following the attack by sunni insurgents on the shia golden shrine at samarra , the panorama team was trapped in the most exposed british base in basra - right in the heart of the city .
a voice came over the tannoy saying that the base was under attack watch corbin 's video dairies we had filmed with this unit , zulu company of the royal fusiliers , three years before when they took over a section of the city and supplied desperate people with water .
now we could only watch as massive demonstrations , called by shia religious leaders , began forming outside the walls of the base .
major john stott was under orders to keep a low profile but his men started preparing their riot gear .
the unspoken fear was what might happen if the thousands of shocked and angry people outside turned on the british base .
in the event , the demonstration passed off peacefully if noisily - the banners railed against the americans and israelis but not the british .
mutual respect iraqis here told us the british were still tolerated - even welcome in some quarters because they had generally behaved in a restrained way towards them and respected their local culture .
there had been some exceptions - the incident where soldiers had been filmed beating up iraqi youths in the town of al-amara had caused anger and political repercussions across the south .
but out on the streets of basra on night patrol with maj stott and his team , i found no open hostility and local youths even chatted with the soldiers about british football .
the british soldiers were bound for the local police station where the aim was to try to get the police to go on a joint patrol .
it was a test of whether the police would abide by the boycott of the british , which the provincial council had instigated after the arrest of alleged corrupt elements in the basra police force .
maj stott was encouraged when the local police agreed to join his soldiers but two minutes later a message was sent to say they had received orders from on high and the patrol was off .
these are the frustrations the british are experiencing three years on as new democratically elected leaders assert their right to rule the city .
criminal gangs in other ways my recent experience in basra contrasted sharply with three years ago .
in 2003 , i had driven all over the city at will - welcome in almost all quarters .

pints have gone up 9p to an average of £ 2.24 for real ale and £ 2.45 for lager , according to a survey of 1,121 pubs by the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- .
the most expensive areas to buy a pint are london and south-east england , with real ale averaging £ 2.42 .
the cheapest is the north west , where real ale costs £ 1.97 and lager £ 2.21 .
the area with the biggest price rise was the north of england , with real ale up 5.34 % to £ 2.06 a pint and lager up 5.12 % to £ 2.35 .
camra spokesman iain loe has told the bbc that any further rises in excise duty would hit the pub-visiting public hard .
" what normally happens is when the chancellor puts a penny on the pint the poor customer in the pub actually gets a 5p increase because there 's so many middle people in between . "
last year gordon brown increased beer duty by 1p , but camera says its survey proves the cost passed on to drinkers was considerably higher .
the group also says that freezing - or reducing - the excise duty would reduce the incentives for people to bring cheap alcohol from abroad into the uk .

pints have gone up 9p to an average of £ 2.24 for real ale and £ 2.45 for lager , according to a survey of 1,121 pubs by the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- .
the most expensive areas to buy a pint are london and south-east england , with real ale averaging £ 2.42 .
the cheapest is the north west , where real ale costs £ 1.97 and lager £ 2.21 .
the area with the biggest price rise was the north of england , with real ale up 5.34 % to £ 2.06 a pint and lager up 5.12 % to £ 2.35 .
camra spokesman iain loe has told the bbc that any further rises in excise duty would hit the pub-visiting public hard .
" what normally happens is when the chancellor puts a penny on the pint the poor customer in the pub actually gets a 5p increase because there 's so many middle people in between . "
last year gordon brown increased beer duty by 1p , but camera says its survey proves the cost passed on to drinkers was considerably higher .
the group also says that freezing - or reducing - the excise duty would reduce the incentives for people to bring cheap alcohol from abroad into the uk .

the area with the biggest price rise was the north of england , with real ale up 5.34 % to £ 2.06 a pint and lager up 5.12 % to £ 2.35 .
camra spokesman iain loe has told the bbc that any further rises in excise duty would hit the pub-visiting public hard .
" what normally happens is when the chancellor puts a penny on the pint the poor customer in the pub actually gets a 5p increase because there 's so many middle people in between . "
last year gordon brown increased beer duty by 1p , but camera says its survey proves the cost passed on to drinkers was considerably higher .
the group also says that freezing - or reducing - the excise duty would reduce the incentives for people to bring cheap alcohol from abroad into the uk .
the camra survey was carried out last month by members of its 200 branches across the uk .
establishments surveyed included managed , tenanted and independently-owned pubs .

the virus , which infects black-eyed peas , was employed as a " scaffold " on to which other chemicals were attached .
by linking iron-containing compounds to the virus 's surface , the john innes centre team was able to create electronically active nanoparticles .
the researchers tell the journal small that their work could be used in the future to make tiny electrical devices .
the work is yet another example of how scientists are now trying to engineer objects on the scale of atoms and molecules .
at the nanoscale , materials can be " tuned " to display unusual properties that could be exploited to build faster , lighter , stronger and more efficient devices and systems .
stores charge the mosaic virus used in the experiments infects black-eyed pea plants -lrb- vigna unguiculata -rrb- , causing their leaves to become mottled and yellow .
not infectious to humans or animals , the miniscule virus measures just 30 nanometres across - where one nanometre is a billionth of a metre .
" we started to think about the virus particles as nano-building blocks , " explained dr david evans , a chemist at the john innes centre and the lead author on the small paper .
" because they have a defined size and a spherical shape , we thought they would be useful particles to use as a template or scaffold in nanotechnology . "
black-eyed peas infected with the virus become mottled and yellow usually , when chemists try to make similar-sized molecules , they find it a struggle ; but the size of a virus is already predefined .
after isolating a virus particle from the peas , the researchers then bound ferrocene compounds to amino acids on its surface .
the team managed to attach approximately 240 of the organometallic compounds , each containing an electronically active iron atom .
the addition of these compounds meant the nanoparticle became like a molecular capacitor - a device that could store electronic charge , explained dr evans .
after further development , this could lead to the particles being used in biosensors , nanoelectronic devices , or for electrocatalytic processes .
the research marks the first foray into nanotechnology for the john innes plant science research centre .
