his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

their nocturnal rest has been disturbed by the regular high-decibel praying coming from the apartment on the second floor .
there , a family 's religious beliefs mandate that they raise the voices to keep the evil one at bay . the deafening devotion began back in october , when pierre d. , his wife and their four children moved into the apartment .
they began praying four times daily at volumes that not only appeared to keep beezelbub at bay , but alienated the other tenants , who had asked them repeatedly to keep it down . " at first we tried being friendly when talking to them , " horst berghahn , a 60-year-old taxi driver , told the newspaper bild .
" after all , we 're working people and need our sleep . " after the loud praying continued unabated , the other residents took legal action which resulted in a notice of eviction for the christian family .
the reason : disturbing the peace through overly loud prayer . family father pierre is unswayed by the legal action and is fighting the eviction in court . " i really do n't want to disturb the neighbors , " he told bild .
" but the high volume is needed in a battle with the devil .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history .

" you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities .

the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .

air berlin hopes to boost its business passengers and broaden its flight network . air berlin , currently europe 's third-place discount carrier , said it will pay a " mid-double-digit million " euro amount for rival dba , adding that the purchase will not burden its annual earnings .
on the contrary , the company expects to post " a significant profit " this year , according to chief executive officer joachim hunold . " air berlin and dba 's route network compliment each other beautifully because there is no overlap , " hunold said .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .
but we again have a lot of friends -lrb- in germany -rrb- . " zeev berkeley added that his experience with the holocaust had nothing to do with the question of whether german peacekeepers should be stationed in the middle east .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

" i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .

the family says the volume in necessary to stave off the devil . the residents at franz stenzer strasse 71 in eastern berlin say they need their sleep , lucifer or no lucifer .
their nocturnal rest has been disturbed by the regular high-decibel praying coming from the apartment on the second floor .
there , a family 's religious beliefs mandate that they raise the voices to keep the evil one at bay . the deafening devotion began back in october , when pierre d. , his wife and their four children moved into the apartment .
they began praying four times daily at volumes that not only appeared to keep beezelbub at bay , but alienated the other tenants , who had asked them repeatedly to keep it down . " at first we tried being friendly when talking to them , " horst berghahn , a 60-year-old taxi driver , told the newspaper bild .
" after all , we 're working people and need our sleep . " after the loud praying continued unabated , the other residents took legal action which resulted in a notice of eviction for the christian family .
the reason : disturbing the peace through overly loud prayer . family father pierre is unswayed by the legal action and is fighting the eviction in court . " i really do n't want to disturb the neighbors , " he told bild .
" but the high volume is needed in a battle with the devil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .
but we again have a lot of friends -lrb- in germany -rrb- . " zeev berkeley added that his experience with the holocaust had nothing to do with the question of whether german peacekeepers should be stationed in the middle east .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .
but we again have a lot of friends -lrb- in germany -rrb- . " zeev berkeley added that his experience with the holocaust had nothing to do with the question of whether german peacekeepers should be stationed in the middle east . " i ca n't blame the people who are soldiers today just because their great-grandparents or grandparents were nazis or possibly nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier cancelled a meeting with syrian president bashar al-assad on short notice because of a speech the president gave blaming israel and the us for tensions in the region .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected .

" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

" we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities .

the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?

" i think we did that and it was great to win my first game 3-0 .
it is a positive sign for the euro qualifiers . " " i think you could see our team matured at the world cup and we have a lot of confidence from that tournament .
we just have to carry on in the euro qualifiers . " for his swedish counterpart lars lagerbäck it was a case of an unpleasant deja vu .
" it was almost a repeat of the world cup , " bemoaned lagerbäck .
" we played against one of the best teams in the world tonight and if they play like they did tonight they will qualify for the european championships . " cup stars form backbone of löw 's team bildunterschrift : löw started with seven of the team that defeated portugal 3-1 in the world cup third-place play-off under klinsmann 's regime and watched on as germany raced into a two-goal lead after just eight minutes . bernd schneider scored only his second international goal in the fourth minute after a clever cutback from tim borowksi . world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , presented with his german player of the year award before the game , then stole center stage taking advantage of some slack defending to bend in an eighth minute shot . game over by half-time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is becoming a habit : klose scores again sweden were shell-shocked - just like they were when germany scored twice in the first 12 minutes of their last 16 world cup victory - and it got worse . klose grabbed a second with a trademark header in the 44th minute taking his tally to 31 goals in 63 matches . the werder bremen forward is now his country 's current top-scorer along with captain michael ballack , who missed the game due to an injury he sustained for chelsea in sunday 's 2-1 community shield defeat to liverpool . sweden were also missing key stars such as zlatan ibrahimovic and freddie ljungberg and it showed . with a 3-0 half-time lead , löw handed international debuts to hertha berlin left back malik fathi , the son of a german mother and turkish father , and mainz 05 defender manuel friedrich . as was to be expected , the second half tailed off with germany reducing the pace of their game and sweden going through the motions . german confidence will now be high for the ireland match , while sweden must regroup ahead of their first euro 2008 qualifier against latvia on september 2 . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden .

" i think we did that and it was great to win my first game 3-0 .
it is a positive sign for the euro qualifiers . " " i think you could see our team matured at the world cup and we have a lot of confidence from that tournament .
we just have to carry on in the euro qualifiers . " for his swedish counterpart lars lagerbäck it was a case of an unpleasant deja vu .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions .

" the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women .

benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities .

" jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .

" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .

the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 possible german peacekeeping in mideast sparks unease in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the idea of german soldiers possibly turning their guns on israelis has prompted unease germany 's possible contribution to an international peacekeeping force in the middle east has raised misgivings not just within the country but also in israel - particularly among holocaust survivors . the intense debate underway in germany over whether the country should contribute to a peacekeeping force on the israeli-lebanese border is highly sensitive given the country 's nazi past and the fact that six million jews were murdered during the third reich . the idea that its armed soldiers might turn their guns on israelis has triggered deep unease in germany and politicians across party lines have expressed skepticism about a peacekeeping deployment with military overtones . reservatio n s i n tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli leaders during the ' march of the living ' in the former death camp auschwitz-birkenau in april this year the issue has sparked misgivings among an older generation of jews , too - those who survived the holocaust and have painful memories of suffering and loss . shlomo shafir , an 82-year-old historian and writer in tel aviv who has been following the news on the formation of an international peacekeeping force , said he is opposed to the idea of germans participating in the mission . " i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .
but we again have a lot of friends -lrb- in germany -rrb- . " zeev berkeley added that his experience with the holocaust had nothing to do with the question of whether german peacekeepers should be stationed in the middle east . " i ca n't blame the people who are soldiers today just because their great-grandparents or grandparents were nazis or possibly nazis , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier cancelled a meeting with syrian president bashar al-assad on short notice because of a speech the president gave blaming israel and the us for tensions in the region .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

the family says the volume in necessary to stave off the devil . the residents at franz stenzer strasse 71 in eastern berlin say they need their sleep , lucifer or no lucifer .
their nocturnal rest has been disturbed by the regular high-decibel praying coming from the apartment on the second floor .
there , a family 's religious beliefs mandate that they raise the voices to keep the evil one at bay . the deafening devotion began back in october , when pierre d. , his wife and their four children moved into the apartment .
they began praying four times daily at volumes that not only appeared to keep beezelbub at bay , but alienated the other tenants , who had asked them repeatedly to keep it down . " at first we tried being friendly when talking to them , " horst berghahn , a 60-year-old taxi driver , told the newspaper bild .
" after all , we 're working people and need our sleep . " after the loud praying continued unabated , the other residents took legal action which resulted in a notice of eviction for the christian family .
the reason : disturbing the peace through overly loud prayer . family father pierre is unswayed by the legal action and is fighting the eviction in court . " i really do n't want to disturb the neighbors , " he told bild .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

the family says the volume in necessary to stave off the devil . the residents at franz stenzer strasse 71 in eastern berlin say they need their sleep , lucifer or no lucifer .
their nocturnal rest has been disturbed by the regular high-decibel praying coming from the apartment on the second floor .
there , a family 's religious beliefs mandate that they raise the voices to keep the evil one at bay . the deafening devotion began back in october , when pierre d. , his wife and their four children moved into the apartment .
they began praying four times daily at volumes that not only appeared to keep beezelbub at bay , but alienated the other tenants , who had asked them repeatedly to keep it down . " at first we tried being friendly when talking to them , " horst berghahn , a 60-year-old taxi driver , told the newspaper bild .
" after all , we 're working people and need our sleep . " after the loud praying continued unabated , the other residents took legal action which resulted in a notice of eviction for the christian family .
the reason : disturbing the peace through overly loud prayer . family father pierre is unswayed by the legal action and is fighting the eviction in court . " i really do n't want to disturb the neighbors , " he told bild .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected .

" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .
a high-ranking general told the same radio station that if germany were part of the peacekeeping force , the israelis would not be able to deal with it in light of their shared history . " you ca n ' t blame them because they 're germa n s " but , not everyone sees a possible german deployment in the middle east as a bad thing . ruth berkeley , another tel aviv resident , said german soldiers equipped with a robust united nations mandate should be allowed to train their guns on israelis too , if need be . " that 's their responsibility then , part of their work , " berkeley told br .
" in the same way that accidents happen here - that we shoot people we did n't mean to shoot - they can take place even then .
you ca n't then blame them because they 're germans . " berkeley who lives with her husband zeev - who she calls wolfgang - in kfar sava near tel aviv , is in her 80s and increasingly speaks in german with her husband .
in the 1930s both of them fled to england to evade persecution by the nazis .
zeev left behind his mother in germany , ruth berkeley only had her visa with her .
the trauma has left lasting scars . " i still ca n't just easily travel to germany , " she said .
" my heart is still heavy - there 's a pain that 's still there .
but we again have a lot of friends -lrb- in germany -rrb- . " zeev berkeley added that his experience with the holocaust had nothing to do with the question of whether german peacekeepers should be stationed in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .
earlier , some jewish leaders had expressed opposition to german involvement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is involved in peacekeeping missions in several crisis regions " germany and israel are friendly nations who are linked together by long and positive diplomatic relations , " knobloch said .
" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities . "
asked by reporters if ground troops would be sent , he responded : " that is not up for debate . " jung added that any further foreign operations would require additional financial support from the federal budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung in congo ; could he be visiting german troops on the mediterranean soon ?
the german news agency ddp also reported that sources close to the government have said that berlin would not send ground or air troops to southern lebanon . other german politicians have come out in recent days against any participation of german soldiers in areas where they could possibly see fighting .
gert weisskirchen , a social democratic parliamentarian , said he could not imagine a situation in which german soldiers would be sent into regions where active hostilities had broken out .
his conservative colleague karl lamber from the christian democrats echoed those sentiments . setting the focus on wednesday , chancellor angela merkel met with her deputy , franz müntefering , and the heads of the christian social union and the social democrats about the peacekeeping mission . the leaders decided germany did want to contribute to the force and that humanitarian aid , rebuilding assistance and securing the syrian-lebanese border from the sea should be the focus of german efforts . criticism of the coalition government 's plans for a force has come primarily from the free-market liberal fdp party .
the party 's foreign policy expert , wolfgang gerhardt , called on the government to clarify the mission mandate further before presenting a concrete plan to the bundestag for a vote . jewish support , popular opposition the president of the central council of jews in germany , charlotte knobloch , welcomed berlin 's deliberation about bundeswehr participation .

" if israel needs help in its current situation , we should not refuse . " most germans still reject sending troops to the middle east .
a recent poll of 1,001 germans found 59 percent are against german participation in an international peacekeeping force .
the same survey found that 37 percent are in favor . french hesitation the french daily le monde said on thursday that france is considering providing only a symbolic force for a un contingent , a move which could delay the mission or even undo the operation . un sources in new york told reuters that officials were working hard to convince france to anchor the force , due to its traditional ties to lebanon , and that un secretary-general kofi annan was due to call french president jacques chirac to talk about the problem . while diplomats had expected france to send at least 2,000 troops , le monde reported that paris wants to send just a dozen officers and around 200 personnel from an engineering division .
france 's reticence follows several disasters that took place during past peacekeeping operations , including a 1983 bomb attack in beirut which killed 58 paratroopers and a mission to bosnia in the early 1990s during which 84 soldiers were lost . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany wants to aid lebanon peace mission chancellor angela merkel and the leaders of the parties in her ruling coalition government said on wednesday they had agreed in principle on contributing to a un force in lebanon .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian . " eu proposes the promotion of " european islam " muslim leaders in britain on tuesday objected to ideas raised by former police officers and others of having airport authorities use personal details including religion and travel history to pinpoint terror suspects . they warned it could alienate the community whose help the government needs in fighting terrorism . in a bid to prevent the radicalization of european muslims , frattini also proposed measures to train imams , or muslim prayer leaders , in how to incorporate european values of human rights into the principles of islam . " we do want a european islam , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " that is very important not only to show to the muslim communities that we fully respect other religions , other faiths , but we also want them to respect national laws , european laws and fundamental rights , and first of all right to live , " frattini said . calls for a common eu approach reid urged his european union counterparts to make sure that anti-terror measures were consistent throughout the 25-member union .
" it 's very important that the measures that are taken in one country are reflected in other countries because we want equal security for all our countries , " reid said . european ministers also released 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 450,000 -rrb- for urgent research into detecting liquid explosives following wednesday 's meeting , a home office spokeswoman told reporters . the meeting in london involved the interior ministers of france , germany , finland , portugal and slovenia as well as frattini and the eu 's counter-terrorism coordinator gijs de vries . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts say germany needs better tools to fight terror the foiling of potentially devastating bomb attacks in britain has germany reviewing its own fight against terror .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .

he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters .

" i 'm against it because i believe that it would threaten our good relations , " shafir told bavarian public radio br .
" i personally see the federal republic of germany as the best german state in german history . " a holocaust survivor , shafir was born in berlin and survived a concentration camp in lithuania and later another satellite death camp of dachau in bavaria . " if a german soldier shoots an israeli , then the whole row will start again - with the nazis , the bundeswehr , then the wehrmacht etc . , " shafir said . that fear is shared by some in israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the challenge of demographic change in old , shriveling europe after decades of ignorance , public awareness of demographic change in europe is growing .

the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .

the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women .

some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options .

he said he saw almost no chance of sending army troops in . jung said that the bundeswehr , or german armed forces , now has around 8,000 soldiers participating in peacekeeping operations around the globe , including afghanistan and congo , and had almost reached its full capacity , although the navy still had some " capabilities .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

finland currently holds the rotating eu presidency . frattini stressed a proposal to help security services better detect explosives , particularly liquid explosives , and trace commercial detonators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers would be subject to more rigorous checks british authorities announced last thursday they had foiled an alleged plot to blow up us-bound airliners in mid-air using liquid explosives smuggled aboard in drinks bottles or other containers . " explosives is an area of particular vulnerability despite the important success achieved by the british authorities , " frattini told a press conference alongside britain 's home secretary john reid . he also proposed expanding a system of sharing data on passengers currently involving the european union , the united states , canada and australia . " our ideas are to extend to the european territory , to all flights into , through , from the territory of one or more member states and perhaps including the intra-eu flights , " frattini said . " we could explore positive profiling for passengers allowing them to be checked well in advance in order to make quicker and easier the controls on board , " he added , without elaborating . british majority in favor of profiling a majority of british voters support profiling air passengers in the wake of an alleged plot to bomb us-bound planes in mid-flight , according to a poll published on thursday . in a poll of 1,696 respondents by yougov published in the spectator magazine , 55 percent backed the idea of security screenings at airports , focusing on the passengers who pose the greatest risk . some 60 percent also said they expected the threat from terrorist groups to worsen , and 79 percent felt the government was not winning the so-called " war on terror . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new security screening measures could be expanded according to the times on tuesday , the department for transport was considering a system to single out people behaving suspiciously , who have an unusual travel pattern , or a certain ethnic or religious background . but the plan - similar to one operated by israeli airline el al - was condemned by one of britain 's most senior muslim police officers , who said that could lead to a new offense of " traveling whilst asian .

his confession has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned . in an interview with german public broadcaster ard on wednesday evening , grass said that he could n't pinpoint the reason for his decision to keep silent on his brief service with the waffen ss towards the end of world war ii .
grass made the admission in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung on saturday .
he said he had volunteered for submarine duty at 15 but was rejected and was later called up to the waffen ss at 17 towards the end of the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass said he could n't pinpoint the reason for his long silence he said that everything he had done since the end of the war counteracted the messages he 'd been infused with during his teenage years in the nazi era .
he thought that " that would be enough , " he told news presenter ulrich wickert . " i was called into the waffen ss , did not take part in any crime , but always felt the need to one day talk about this in a greater context , " grass said . grass , 78 , famous for his first novel " the tin drum " and for becoming the moral voice of germany 's postwar generation , has come under heavy criticism for his belated admission . the waffen ss was a highly-trained nazi combat unit , initially made up of volunteers , which took part in the holocaust and committed war crimes .
however , by the end of the war most members were drafted and many were under 18 . grass , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , had previously said he was drafted in 1944 to help anti-aircraft gun teams .
he was held as a prisoner of war until 1946 .
after the war , he become an outspoken pacifist .
for decades he had demanded that germans come to terms with their nazi past by being open about it . book orders have doubled some critics have accused the nobel prize-winning author of timing his confession to pique interest in his new autobiography , " peeling onions . " in response to the media furore , german bookshops have started selling the book two weeks earlier than planned . " there is a very great interest in the book , " said a spokeswoman for bookshop dussmann in berlin . " the publisher had already delivered the book and so we will make the most of that interest and are starting to sell the book , " she told reuters . grass ' publisher , steidl , said on thursday that orders have more than doubled for the autobiography . steidl had printed 150,000 hardback copies of " peeling onions " and 130,000 have been sold to stores in germany , austria and switzerland , said claudia glenewinkel , a spokeswoman for the göttingen-based publisher . she said bookshops had pre-ordered 60,000 copies of the memoir " before all the hype and hysteria " but orders more than doubled after grass dropped his bombshell at the weekend . " we changed the release date because people were coming into shops to ask for the book , " glenewinkel said .
" one or two shops sold it and then there was a domino effect , so we told everybody they could sell . " glenewinkel said a second print run had been ordered and the book was expected to be widely translated . supporters speak out since his admission , grass has been on the receiving end of a barrage of criticism from writers , literary critics , historians and politicians who accuse him of hypocrisy .
however , some supportive voices have emerged amid the din . the director of the film version of " the tin drum , " volker schlöndorff , on thursday joined the minority who has come to his defence . in an open letter published in der tagesspiegel newspaper , schlöndorff said the confession saw grass apply the same scrutiny to himself that he does to his fictional characters . " i hope that you feel greatly liberated by no longer having to be a living monument , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rushdie said grass is still a giant in the world of literature british writer salman rushdie , no stranger to criticism himself , also sprang to the defense of günter grass . " i feel that the outrage is a little bit manufactured , " rushdie said . describing grass ' waffen ss membership as a forgiveable mistake because of his youth , rushdie told bbc radio : " his stature comes from the fact that he is a giant in the world of literature .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2006 no brakes on germany 's population freefall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are increasingly choosing not to have kids a new study out by germany 's federal statistics office shows the country 's birth rate continues to decline .
some reports even say the eastern city of chemnitz has the lowest number of babies born in the world . while the cityscape of chemnitz with its large number of pre-fab apartment blocks might not be to everyone 's taste , the city hardly looks like a slum .
money has poured in to rebuild the infrastructure after german reunification ; a few prestigious architectural projects have added some pizzazz to downtown ; and the city is having some success remaking itself into a high-tech center .
it 's not a bad place to live . still , women in chemnitz are choosing not to have children , or at least very many of them .
with only 6.9 children born per 1,000 people in 2005 , the birth rate of this city , which was known as karl-marx-stadt during the east german era , has fallen into the sub-sub-basement .
few are optimistic it will climb out anytime soon . " families say they want kids , even several kids , but many are saying , ' no , we had better wait ' , " said annette buschmann , director of the women 's counseling department at the stadtmission chemnitz .
she and her staff counsel pregnant women on their various options . " in our office , we hear all the time that it 's an overall insecurity about work and one 's future economic security that keeps women from having children , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spruced-up market square of chemnitz is not enough to inspire babymaking , it appears chemnitz finds itself in the same situation many eastern german cities do , which have yet to see the " blossoming landscapes " promised by then-chancellor helmut kohl when east and west germany were unified .
the unemployment rate in chemnitz is over 20 percent , and the city 's population is shrinking , having lost more than a fifth of its population since 1990 .
many of those unsightly housing blocks built to house the socialist worker sit empty . for those living on unemployment or welfare and worried about new reforms that promise to whittle away at benefits , having children starts to look less attractive or simply not realistic . " you still see pregnant women on the street , " said buschmann .
" what you do notice in the last few years though is that it 's much harder for women to decide to have a second or third child . " deaths outpace births while the problem is particularly pronounced in eastern germany , it 's not limited to the former gdr .
the report out this week from germany 's federal statistics office shows more people died in the country in 2005 than were born . while there were 830,000 deaths last year , only 686,000 babies came into the world , half as many as in the early 1960s .
that means the death rate increased 1.5 percent from 2004 and 2005 , while the birth rate fell 2.8 percent over the same period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare species in germany according to the statistics agency , the trend that began in the early 90s shows no sign of stopping : fewer children are being born in germany ; and because of improved medical care , people are living longer .
the society is getting greyer . germany 's overall 2004 birth rate of 1.37 -lrb- according to numbers by the eu 's statistics office eurostat -rrb- , puts it near the bottom of the western european pack , although some southern and eastern european countries are lower .
that number is far below the replacement level of 2.1 percent needed to keep a country 's population stable without large-scale immigration . eastern extreme while birth rates in germany have been declining gradually since the 1970s , eastern germany experienced a demographic earthquake right after reunification .
in parts of saxony , 80 percent fewer babies were born in the years following the collapse of east germany .
the numbers have stabilized somewhat , but there are still only one-third the number of children born in eastern germany as were before the berlin wall fell . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : empty socialist apartment blocks are being torn down - their residents have left experts say in parts of the east , particularly more rural areas , a " worst-case scenario " developed .
the low fertility rate combined with a large outward migration of young people looking for work in western germany or abroad led to a drastic drop in population levels . besides the economic fears , other reasons for low birth rates across the country include a conservative tradition where women are expected to stay at home with the children , schools that let out at lunchtime and a tax system that discriminates against working women . " young men have learned from the society that they can only start a family when they can actually provide for a family , " said andreas lange , a researcher at the german youth institute .
" the ' male as breadwinner ' model is still very strong . " the government has tried to address the issue , although most experts say the efforts come some 20 years too late .
benefits have been increased to encourage more women to have children , but most experts say the effects will likely be negligible and that germany is still not very kid friendly in a lot of areas . " for example , dog food has a sales tax rate of seven percent ; diapers , though , get taxed at 16 percent , " said regina mannel , director of the saxony state office of the paritätische wohlfahrtsverband charity .
" that might be a drastic example , but it shows that many things in the area of policy have simply been neglected . " consequences ? business leaders worry that the population decline will hurt germany 's competitiveness . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shape of things to come ?
" we are reaching a critical point , " michael hüther , head of the cologne institute of business research , said in an interview in the newspaper die welt .
" the availability of human capital will get worse and act as a brake on growth . " but others warn against panicking , saying germany 's population is going to shrink and it 's best to learn how to manage it instead of trying to stave off the inevitable .
the german youth institute 's andreas lange said there was a danger that a greyer society could be less innovative , but he also saw a few potential positives in a smaller germany . " we already have massive problems finding training spots for youth and student-teacher ratios that are too high , " he said .
" this could actually be an opportunity for us to devote more to the individual child .
each one of them will become more important .

david carruthers was freed on a $ 1m -lrb- £ 527,196 -rrb- bail bond , which included strict curbs on his movements .
he must wear an electronic tag and has been confined to a st louis residence .
uk-based betonsports sacked mr carruthers after he was arrested by us authorities as he passed through a texas airport on 16 july .
the group has also shut down all of its us activities since the 48-year-old 's arrest .
the us had been the group 's biggest market .
online gaming crackdown the case is one of the biggest us prosecutions faced by an online gaming company .
betonsports and executives from other gaming firms are facing a 22-count indictment alleging racketeering , fraud , tax evasion and conspiracy .
the charges allege that betonsports failed to pay us excise taxes on more than $ 3.3bn in bets taken from us gamblers .
the authorities are seeking forfeiture of $ 4.5bn , removal of access to betonsports sites in the us and the return of money held for us account holders .
the london-based company is currently complying with the court order by not taking bets from gamblers in the us , however it has yet to offer a defence to the us charges or have a lawyer present in court .
analysts say the legal action is part of a bid by us authorities to make online gambling illegal in the country under the 1961 wire act .
the subject has been somewhat of a grey area as gambling is illegal in many parts of the us .
however , some internet gaming firms have hundreds of thousands of us customers as they are based offshore in countries that allow gambling and so were viewed as out of reach of us laws .

gareth jones bbc wales business editor with the a-level results in , youngsters in wales are now planning their next move .
five times as many of them will go into higher education than they did 25 years ago .
that 's a huge increase and it 's being driven by government policy .
but are youngsters doing the right courses at university to get themselves a job ?
are more graduates good for business ?
and do you have to have a degree today to succeed ?
the welsh assembly government -lrb- wag -rrb- wants more graduates so we can compete globally .
last year a snapshot survey suggested nearly two-out-of-three sixth formers are now going on to higher education .
that compares with just over one in 10 back in the late seventies .
representatives of big business say we need more graduates because having a university degree indicates certain standards .
according to david rosser of cbi wales : " a university degree should show - if students have n't been spoon fed - that you are self-motivated and capable of independent thought and learning . "
not everyone thinks graduates are necessarily good for business , though .
one of the country 's most famous entrepreneurs , sir alan sugar , has gone on record as saying he 'd rather employ people who 've made their own way in the world straight after school .
the two finalists in his tv show the apprentice had only five gcses between them .
but a visit to the noisy , vibrant floor of one of wales most successful new companies , communications direct , suggests that all kinds - graduates and people with more vocational training , are needed in modern business .
science and technology the company is expanding rapidly and has half a million mobile phone customers .
perhaps most significantly of all , its co-founder , marc winchester , of swansea , left school at 17 .
" i 'm a big believer in the " university of life " , he says .
" leaving school early gave me a hunger for money and now i have a company employing 500 people . "
with wag emphasising the need for more of us to start our own business , should n't we be cultivating more people like marc with his money-making nous rather than getting more into university ?
wag says no , because many of the new industries of the future will require graduates in science and technology .
the problem is many of our young people do n't seem interested in studying these subjects .
according to the union amicus , the growth in university entrance may not do every student or the economy much good .
cath speight , who represents amicus in wales , says : " too many youngsters are doing degrees in subjects like media studies or ' football studies ' .
" there needs to be more consultation between government , business and education .
but i think this is beginning to happen in wales . "
clearly , with other countries producing more and more highly qualified people , we need to as well .
but there 's still work to be done on exactly what careers we should be asking our young people to follow .

gareth jones bbc wales business editor five times more people go to university now than 25 years ago with the a-level results in , youngsters in wales are now planning their next move .
five times as many of them will go into higher education than they did 25 years ago .
that 's a huge increase and it 's being driven by government policy .
but are youngsters doing the right courses at university to get themselves a job ?
are more graduates good for business ?
and do you have to have a degree today to succeed ?
the welsh assembly government -lrb- wag -rrb- wants more graduates so we can compete globally .
last year a snapshot survey suggested nearly two-out-of-three sixth formers are now going on to higher education .
that compares with just over one in 10 back in the late seventies .
representatives of big business say we need more graduates because having a university degree indicates certain standards .
wales needs more graduates for industry , assembly ministers say according to david rosser of cbi wales : " a university degree should show - if students have n't been spoon fed - that you are self-motivated and capable of independent thought and learning . "
not everyone thinks graduates are necessarily good for business , though .
one of the country 's most famous entrepreneurs , sir alan sugar , has gone on record as saying he 'd rather employ people who 've made their own way in the world straight after school .
the two finalists in his tv show the apprentice had only five gcses between them .
but a visit to the noisy , vibrant floor of one of wales most successful new companies , communications direct , suggests that all kinds - graduates and people with more vocational training , are needed in modern business .
science and technology the company is expanding rapidly and has half a million mobile phone customers .
perhaps most significantly of all , its co-founder , marc winchester , of swansea , left school at 17 .
" i 'm a big believer in the " university of life " , he says .
" leaving school early gave me a hunger for money and now i have a company employing 500 people . "
with wag emphasising the need for more of us to start our own business , should n't we be cultivating more people like marc with his money-making nous rather than getting more into university ?
wag says no , because many of the new industries of the future will require graduates in science and technology .

maintenance workers at haggerston castle holiday park near berwick , discovered the shell , thought to be a german " big bertha " howitzer .
it is thought the 3ft shell , which has an inscription , was presented to villagers in nearby beal in recognition of fundraising efforts for the war .
local historians said it was one of few artefacts from ww1 to be found in beal , which does not have a war memorial .
ian martin , curator of the kings own borderers museum in berwick , said the inscribed shell was most likely given to beal after the armistice .
donal o 'sullivan , general manager of haggerston castle , said investigations were continuing to determine exactly why type of shell the bomb was .
he added : " it is fascinating to find out the history of the shell - indeed haggerston castle is steeped in fascinating history .

" we may put it on permanent display as part of the new development at the stable block or it may be better on show somewhere in beal or at berwick museum . "
