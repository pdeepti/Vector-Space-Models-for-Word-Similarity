other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol . kyprianou has , however , hinted that he favors warning labels - similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes - that make the dangers of alcohol clear . " dri n ki n g harms your u n bor n baby " o n bottles ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could similar labels start appearing on wine and beer bottles ?
brewers and wine makers across europe , however , have come out against placing " drinking kills " or other labels on bottles of beer . " warning labels are the completely wrong way to go , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers association told germany 's express newspaper .
" the do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work . " industry groups also opposed implementing eu-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems . " policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences , will fail to deal with the social problems , while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections , " said rodolphe de looz-corswarem of brewers of europe . keepi n g social vices separate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say alcohol should not be treated the same as smoking green party eu parliamentarian hiltrud breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop " saber rattling " before it sees the a final version of the eu 's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse .
german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer said he would wait to see what kyprianou 's actual suggestions are before commenting . other german politicians , however , were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette . " people should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine , " german eu representative karl-heinz florenz told der tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that when it comes to alcohol , each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse . the harm of " passive dri n ki n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drunk driving is behind 100,000 traffic deaths , according to the eu while cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff , moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from " passive drinking , " peter liese , a german eu representative , told the paper . the commission 's report disagreed with liese 's conclusion , saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births .
the report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the eu 125 billion euros -lrb- $ 161 billion -rrb- in 2003 . some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in europe drink what the eu considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism , according to eu statistics . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time .

" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .

i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .

other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol . kyprianou has , however , hinted that he favors warning labels - similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes - that make the dangers of alcohol clear .

brewers and wine makers across europe , however , have come out against placing " drinking kills " or other labels on bottles of beer . " warning labels are the completely wrong way to go , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers association told germany 's express newspaper .
" the do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work . " industry groups also opposed implementing eu-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems .

german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer said he would wait to see what kyprianou 's actual suggestions are before commenting . other german politicians , however , were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette . " people should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine , " german eu representative karl-heinz florenz told der tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that when it comes to alcohol , each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse . the harm of " passive dri n ki n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drunk driving is behind 100,000 traffic deaths , according to the eu while cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff , moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from " passive drinking , " peter liese , a german eu representative , told the paper . the commission 's report disagreed with liese 's conclusion , saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births .
the report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the eu 125 billion euros -lrb- $ 161 billion -rrb- in 2003 . some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in europe drink what the eu considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism , according to eu statistics . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

why do we not love anything anymore ? " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin hosts world 's largest roundtable why do the bad guys always win -lrb- outside hollywood -rrb- ?

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .

the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .
" what happened to our humbleness ?
why do we not love anything anymore ? " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin hosts world 's largest roundtable why do the bad guys always win -lrb- outside hollywood -rrb- ?

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .

this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit .

the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .

he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles .

" a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

the pontiff was driven to the mass in his " papamobile " under clear blue skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : priests are protected with yellow umbrellas as they deliver the communion to faithful during the mass he told the predominantly german crowd in a field next to munich 's convention centre that there was a danger of a " hardness of hearing where god is concerned . " " this is something from which we particularly suffer in our own time , " the pope said .
" put simply , we are no longer able to hear god - there are too many different frequencies filling our ears , " he said . " along with this hardness of hearing or outright deafness where god is concerned , we naturally lose our ability to speak with him and to him . " pope calls on catholic church to seek converts the 79-year-old pontiff has said the visit to bavaria is a trip down memory lane but it has the more serious purpose of attempting to arrest the decline of religious observance in germany . christian belief in germany is about equally split between catholics and protestants but has seen a dramatic drop in religious observance in recent decades .
more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .
renate boml , 45 , had risen at dawn to catch a train from her village to attend the mass . " the pope has pleasantly surprised me with his personal warmth and his intelligence , " she said .
" we are happy to be here for this celebration of our beliefs . " pope urges germany to do more for muslim integration a day earlier , the pope said on his arrival in munich that there was " fatigue everywhere " but added : " german catholicism is not as tired as some people think . " german president horst köhler , a protestant , urged the pope on friday to do more to foster ecumenical cooperation . " even if we ca n't sweep aside 500 years with clever discussions , we will try with our hearts and our heads to come closer , " the pope replied , referring to the reformation in the 16th century that split western christianity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met with german president horst köhler benedict also suggested germany could improve muslim integration , köhler said after a private meeting . " he made clear that we should try to make a greater effort to integrate muslim citizens , " köhler said .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?

the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .
" what happened to our humbleness ?

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .

the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .

think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .

and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

the pontiff was driven to the mass in his " papamobile " under clear blue skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : priests are protected with yellow umbrellas as they deliver the communion to faithful during the mass he told the predominantly german crowd in a field next to munich 's convention centre that there was a danger of a " hardness of hearing where god is concerned . " " this is something from which we particularly suffer in our own time , " the pope said .
" put simply , we are no longer able to hear god - there are too many different frequencies filling our ears , " he said . " along with this hardness of hearing or outright deafness where god is concerned , we naturally lose our ability to speak with him and to him . " pope calls on catholic church to seek converts the 79-year-old pontiff has said the visit to bavaria is a trip down memory lane but it has the more serious purpose of attempting to arrest the decline of religious observance in germany . christian belief in germany is about equally split between catholics and protestants but has seen a dramatic drop in religious observance in recent decades .
more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .
renate boml , 45 , had risen at dawn to catch a train from her village to attend the mass . " the pope has pleasantly surprised me with his personal warmth and his intelligence , " she said .
" we are happy to be here for this celebration of our beliefs . " pope urges germany to do more for muslim integration a day earlier , the pope said on his arrival in munich that there was " fatigue everywhere " but added : " german catholicism is not as tired as some people think . " german president horst köhler , a protestant , urged the pope on friday to do more to foster ecumenical cooperation . " even if we ca n't sweep aside 500 years with clever discussions , we will try with our hearts and our heads to come closer , " the pope replied , referring to the reformation in the 16th century that split western christianity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met with german president horst köhler benedict also suggested germany could improve muslim integration , köhler said after a private meeting . " he made clear that we should try to make a greater effort to integrate muslim citizens , " köhler said .
" he said germany could give a signal to the muslim world that we want to live happily together , that they are welcome . " later on sunday , the pope is expected to celebrate vespers in munich cathedral , a familiar location for the former cardinal joseph ratzinger who was archbishop of the city from 1977 to 1982 . nostalgic visit the other masses will take place in the town of alltöting on monday and in the city of regensburg on tuesday . this visit bears the personal stamp of the pope , who said on his arrival that his heart " beats with a bavarian rhythm . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marktl is gearing up for the pope 's visit with a local bakering producing cross-bearing goodies on monday , he will visit the house in the small town of marktl am inn near the austrian border where he was born on april 16 , 1927 . the pope will spend wednesday with his brother , monsignor georg ratzinger , in regensburg and together they will visit the graves of their mother , father and sister . this is benedict 's fourth foreign trip since becoming pope in april last year and the second to germany in that time .
he is due to visit turkey in november and brazil next year . security for the german trip is tight in the wake of the attempted bombings of two passenger trains in two western cities in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 10.09.2006 digital activism : " dropping knowledge " launched in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roundtable moderators hafsat abiola and willem dafoe if revolution is indeed " the sex of politics " - as american critic h.l. mencken once called it - berlin became for a day the capital of a new kind of revolution : glamorous , digital and corporate-funded . on sept .
9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .

the pontiff was driven to the mass in his " papamobile " under clear blue skies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : priests are protected with yellow umbrellas as they deliver the communion to faithful during the mass he told the predominantly german crowd in a field next to munich 's convention centre that there was a danger of a " hardness of hearing where god is concerned . " " this is something from which we particularly suffer in our own time , " the pope said .
" put simply , we are no longer able to hear god - there are too many different frequencies filling our ears , " he said . " along with this hardness of hearing or outright deafness where god is concerned , we naturally lose our ability to speak with him and to him . " pope calls on catholic church to seek converts the 79-year-old pontiff has said the visit to bavaria is a trip down memory lane but it has the more serious purpose of attempting to arrest the decline of religious observance in germany . christian belief in germany is about equally split between catholics and protestants but has seen a dramatic drop in religious observance in recent decades .
more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .
renate boml , 45 , had risen at dawn to catch a train from her village to attend the mass . " the pope has pleasantly surprised me with his personal warmth and his intelligence , " she said .
" we are happy to be here for this celebration of our beliefs . " pope urges germany to do more for muslim integration a day earlier , the pope said on his arrival in munich that there was " fatigue everywhere " but added : " german catholicism is not as tired as some people think . " german president horst köhler , a protestant , urged the pope on friday to do more to foster ecumenical cooperation . " even if we ca n't sweep aside 500 years with clever discussions , we will try with our hearts and our heads to come closer , " the pope replied , referring to the reformation in the 16th century that split western christianity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met with german president horst köhler benedict also suggested germany could improve muslim integration , köhler said after a private meeting . " he made clear that we should try to make a greater effort to integrate muslim citizens , " köhler said .
" he said germany could give a signal to the muslim world that we want to live happily together , that they are welcome .

" there are three grands prix still left in the current season - in china on october 1 , japan on october 8 and brazil on october 22 . schumacher is expected to compete in his last race in brazil . " this is the right moment " the german will now prepare to bring the curtain down on 15 years of almost unrivalled , statistical domination of the sport . sunday 's achievement was his fifth win at the famed italian circuit . an emotional but controlled schumacher said afterwards : " there has been a lot of discussion for a long time about my decision to retire .
and all the motor sport people have a right to have an explanation of what will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher with his wife corinna and manager willi weber in 2001 " you have to find the moment , and we feel this is the right moment .
i can not thank my family enough but also to all my mates at -lrb- former team -rrb- benetton and at ferrari and i have so many great friends there , " he said . controversial career however , schumacher 's glittering career has been dogged by controversy . this year at monaco , he was roundly condemned when he was accused of deliberately parking his ferrari on the circuit to stop world champion fernando alonso from bettering his qualifying time . " everyone has black marks on their record but i do not have many , " schumacher declared .
" those who shout their mouths off are too cowardly to say something to my face .
you have envy and rivals here in formula one just like in life . " a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

other options include a 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol . kyprianou has , however , hinted that he favors warning labels - similar to those that appear on packs of cigarettes - that make the dangers of alcohol clear . " dri n ki n g harms your u n bor n baby " o n bottles ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could similar labels start appearing on wine and beer bottles ?
brewers and wine makers across europe , however , have come out against placing " drinking kills " or other labels on bottles of beer . " warning labels are the completely wrong way to go , " peter hahn , head of the german brewers association told germany 's express newspaper .
" the do not deter people who have lost a sense of how much to drink and unsettle the people who enjoy a beer after work . " industry groups also opposed implementing eu-wide guidelines in countries with traditionally different ways of approaching drinking and drinking problems . " policies that do not consider cultural and regional differences , will fail to deal with the social problems , while at the same time generate a rising level of political objections , " said rodolphe de looz-corswarem of brewers of europe . keepi n g social vices separate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians say alcohol should not be treated the same as smoking green party eu parliamentarian hiltrud breyer meanwhile called on the alcohol industry to stop " saber rattling " before it sees the a final version of the eu 's strategy to prevent alcohol abuse .
german consumer affairs minister horst seehofer said he would wait to see what kyprianou 's actual suggestions are before commenting . other german politicians , however , were more willing to voice the opposition to putting a sip of wine on the same footing with a puff of a cigarette . " people should not expect that a skull and crossbones end up on every bottle of beer and wine , " german eu representative karl-heinz florenz told der tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that when it comes to alcohol , each member state should be responsible for how it deals with alcohol abuse . the harm of " passive dri n ki n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drunk driving is behind 100,000 traffic deaths , according to the eu while cigarettes are a health risk from the first puff , moderate drinking can actually be healthy and there is no danger from " passive drinking , " peter liese , a german eu representative , told the paper . the commission 's report disagreed with liese 's conclusion , saying alcohol abuse had a major role in as many as 200,000 deaths in europe due to car accidents and disease and played a role in some 60,000 underweight births .
the report also estimated the effects of alcohol abuse of costing the eu 125 billion euros -lrb- $ 161 billion -rrb- in 2003 . some 25 percent of men and 10 percent of women in europe drink what the eu considers to be more than healthy amounts of alcohol and between 3 percent and 5 percent are suffering from alcoholism , according to eu statistics . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de possible smoking legislation sparks heated discussion while german lawmakers consider implementing a non-smoker protection law and banning smoking in restaurants , a case in ireland revealed that excluding smokers from a job selection process does n't conflict with eu law .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .

think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .

" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .

a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .
" no clue , " answered his journalist colleague .
winds of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoke signals got too smoky after a while the only subversion of the rules of corporate engagement came - unexpectedly and serendipitously - from a force of nature .
at the beginning of the discussion , the organizers used small explosions of white smoke in the middle of the square to announce when three minutes had passed and when it was time for a new question . " look , they 've elected a new pope , " said one observer , jokingly referring to the ancient vatican tradition of announcing the election of a new pontiff by a puff of white smoke .
the low wind , however , started pushing the smoke back to the roundtable , creating for a while a surreal scene that resembled a large , open-air opium den .
the practice of smoke signals was then abandoned and the moderators , visibly amused , took over the role of monitoring time .
a tour de force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : practicing for the roundtable : performer jonathan meese there were , according to the organizers , around 10,000 people watching the broadcast over the internet at any given moment .
what they got to see was an exhilarating piece of video art : a hypnotic symphony of voices and languages that at time - especially in moments when different voices would fade into each other - reminded of wim wenders ' 1987 cinematic masterpiece " wings of desire . "
this ecumenical stream of consciousness , a rootless cosmopolitan 's dream come true , was in itself a powerful symbol of cross-cultural communication : imperfect , struggling and not easy , but with a sense of common purpose .
" it is the multiplicity of languages that divides us , " said novelist , poet and holocaust survivor raymond federman .
" we do n't understand each other .
we live in a tower of babel ...
but i wish i could learn all the language of the world . "
it remains to be seen what kind of effect dropping knowledge will have .
it is impossible to predict whether the platform for social dialogue will have a significant or , in fact , any impact in our post-industrial , digital world .
nobody knows if individuals and organizations around the world will adopt it and put it to use .
" the table of free voices " was simply a symbolic beginning of a social experiment .
" why have we become so anti-radical ? " asked german artist jonathan meese at the end of the day .

9 , prominent scientists , artists , activists and thinkers got together in berlin for what the organizers - a german-us non-profit organization dropping knowledge - called " the world 's greatest roundtable discussion . "
in what was a peculiar combination of political theater , performance art , a focus group and a corporate gala , 112 participants launched a new internet platform for promoting social issues through dialogue by answering simultaneously 100 most pressing questions facing the world of today and tomorrow . the questions - such as " are brands more powerful than governments ? " , " when might it become necessary to break the law ? " or " what is god 's religion ? " - were submitted over the past year over the internet and rated by the general public on the dropping knowledge website .
each of the participants in the so-called " table of free voices " - among them the ubiquitous human rights activist bianca jagger ; the only professor of princeton university who produced a rap cd and starred in " the matrix " trilogy , cornell west ; and , in a commendable spirit of inclusion , us anti-globalist and critic of modern technologies , jerry mander - were seated in front of a microphone and a video camera , and given three minutes to answer each question .
11,200 answers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you had one piece of knowledge to give to the world , what would it be ?
the whole event was broadcast live over the internet .
additionally , some 11,200 answers that were collected this way will be archived , transcribed and translated into english if necessary .
they will be made available permanently and for no charge as part of the dropping knowledge audio-visual library on the internet .
the general public will be able to donate more questions , comment and answer the existing ones and use the platform as a virtual meeting place , research library and a permanent networking venue .
this remarkably glitzy all-day event was moderated by human rights activist hafsat abiola and us actor willem defoe .
the round-table - 38 meters in diameter , 119 in circumference - was constructed on the historic bebel square in downtown berlin , where , on may 10 , 1933 , the nazis burned some 20,000 politically or artistically " degenerate " books from the library of humboldt university as part of the nationwide war " against the un-german spirit . "
" this place has a lot of history , " said organizer ralf schmerberg at the opening of the event .
" books used to be burned here .
thoughts got burned .
freedom of speech got burned .
bringing new ideas to this place is a good thing . "
think globally , act digitally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dropping knowledge is a platform for activism in the age of digital communication the striking thing about the dropping knowledge project is that its view of activism , social progress and participatory democracy of the 21st century is inseparable from the development of modern technology .
the dropping knowledge platform was developed by the german research center for artificial intelligence -lrb- dfki -rrb- in co-operation with dropping knowledge teams from berlin and san francisco .
it works as a semantically organized catalogue of 23,000 different topics that non-government organizations have addressed over the past twenty years , a database of social and environmental themes ranging from soil erosion to minority rights .
these themes are filed in different categories and can be searched , both using a traditional keyword search and visually , using an intuitive navigation system .
" as we know , the internet opens new possibilities of collecting , sharing and using knowledge , " said hans uszkoreit , who leads the research lab on language technologies at dfki .
" many experts believe that the web of tomorrow will become more semantic .
that means : machines will no longer be able only to scan keywords , but will be able actually to understand language .
the technology that i am working on connects digital pieces with a collective memory , " he said .
mapping knowledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social change is at the heart of the dropping knowledge project the goal of the system is to become a virtual map and universal repository of knowledge that individuals or organizations can use for networking , research and inspiration .
most importantly , however , all the content - including the audio and video materials - will be made available with a so-called copyleft licence , which allows content use and distribution for non-comercial purposes without any restrictions other than proper attribution .
" we are in the process of liberating knowledge , " said mae-wan ho , a professor of biochemistry and prominent biosafety activist , during the roundtable .
" that is what we 're doing here . "
it has been estimated that some 1 billion people on earth are using the internet today .
dropping knowledge is made for them .
as such , it is a brainchild of techno-romanticism , a utopian vision of social integration through electronic communication .
yet , internet users today still make up only 16 percent of the world population .
almost one half of internet users come from europe and north america .
and while almost 70 percent of north americans have internet access , only 2.6 percent of africans do .
the digital divide , which is a mere reflection of economic and educational inequalities in the world , is a reality that no amount of optimism , good will and investment in online communities can change overnight .
circles of love and power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director wim wenders took part in the " table of free voices " the internet has , nonetheless , a potential for unpredictability .
the founding partner of dropping knowledge , germany 's insurance giant allianz , contributed alone 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.2 million -rrb- to the project .
yet it was internet users who asked if big companies could at all act responsibly and voted on this question as one of the top 100 .
numerous questions submitted to the project website had to do with allianz and its drastic job cuts - the company announced in june it would axe 5,000 jobs at its insurance division and shed a further 2,480 jobs within its dresdner bank division until 2008 .
and while german director wim wenders - answering the question about the future of the city - passionately spoke about encountering a flea market under a highway in brasilia as a kind of urban wilderness , " the only place in the city they forgot to plan , " and praised berlin for its adventurous " no-man 's lands , which are actually every man 's lands , " the " table of free voices " did not leave anything to chance .
security , clearly demarcated and sequestered zones - the press , the guests , the general public and , of course , allianz - made it obvious that this was no revolutionary grunge party and that corporate-sponsored revolutions must follow certain , traditional rules .
" how do i as a member of the press enter the inner circle ? " asked one professional photographer .

" a potent cocktail of bloody-mindedness and brilliance behind the wheel has kept the german at the peak of his sport despite enduring an inauspicious start to his career . in belgium in 1991 , he was drafted in by jordan as a late replacement for frenchman bertrand gachot who had been jailed in britain . schumacher qualified seventh at spa , but failed to complete the first lap , due to clutch problems . his potential was spotted by flavio briatore 's benetton for whom he picked up his first career win in 1992 before taking fourth place in the championship in 1993 . dawning of a new era bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayrton senna 's death in 1994 sent shockwaves through the motor racing world he clinched his first title in 1994 , the year of ayrton senna 's death , and there was little doubt about the dawning of a new era in the sport even if this new horizon was clouded by controversy . schumacher made sure of the title , beating damon hill by just one point , but only after an accident at the last race in australia where the two men collided .
he defended the title in 1995 before switching to ferrari , winning three races in his first season in a car dogged by poor reliability and sluggish handling . in 1997 , the first sparks of a bitter rivalry with jacques villeneuve became public in dramatic circumstances . schumacher went into the last race at jerez with a one-point advantage over the canadian but it ended in an accident between the two . villeneuve raced on to take the crown ; schumacher had his second place in the championship stripped by the fia . schumacher 's hopes in 1998 were dashed in the final race despite having picked up six wins while 1999 's title push ended with a broken leg after a spectacular crash at silverstone . in 2000 rubens barrichello replaced eddie irvine as schumacher 's teammate and the chemistry seemed to work .
the brazilian , very much the supporting actor , watched as the german took his third world title , delivering ferrari 's first in 21 years . total dominance 2001 was a year of total dominance with a successive title wrapped up with four races to spare .
schumacher set records all over the place , going past alain prost 's total of 52 race wins . any lingering doubts over schumacher 's supremacy at ferrari disappeared in another title winning season in 2002 when his fifth crown , equaling the mark of juan fangio , was tarnished by barrichello being forced to yield on the finish line to hand the german victory in austria . the boos did n't unsettle him as 2003 and 2004 saw two more titles . " f1 will survive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher is known as one of the greatest drivers of all time schumacher then won over a new legion of fans by donating $ 10 million of his own fortune to victims of the asian tsunami ; he had lost a bodyguard in the disaster . 2005 may have seen his title monopoly snapped by fernando alonso 's renault , but this year he looks likely to push the spaniard all the way . his departure from the sport will not signal the sport 's death knell . f1 supremo bernie ecclestone recalled similar fears after senna died . " ayrton was more popular than michael , " said ecclestone .
" but we went on .
f1 has survived since 1950 so i assume that it is more popular than one driver .

more than 100,000 people are said to leave the german catholic church every year . in his sermon , the pope also criticized the german catholic church for its reluctance to evangelize , saying that while it was always ready to help dioceses in africa or eastern europe to rebuild their churches or embark on social projects , it seemed reluctant to seek converts to the catholic faith . he said bishops in those regions of the world had learned from experience that " evangelization should be foremost , the god of jesus christ must be known , believed in and loved , and hearts must be converted if progress is to be made on social issues and reconciliation is to begin and if , for example , aids is to be combated by realistically facing its deeper causes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a praying nun folds her hands during the papal mass his message went down well with the bavarian faithful .

lawrence barham has been studying tools and other artefacts left by ancient humans at a site in zambia .
he says the range of mineral pigments , or ochres , found there hints at the use of paint , perhaps to mark the body .
if correct , it would push back the earliest known example of abstract thinking by at least 100,000 years .
being able to conceptualise - the ability to let one thing represent another - was a giant leap in human evolution .
it was the mental activity that would eventually permit the development of sophisticated language and maths .
language proxy shells from israel that were strung as beads into a necklace or bracelet are widely accepted to be the oldest unequivocal evidence for such behaviour in humans .
' oldest jewellery ' revealed but dr barham said it would be hard to accept that humans were not engaged in such activity much earlier in the archaeological record .
" as an archaeologist i am interested to find out where colour symbolism first appears because for colour symbolism to work it must be attached to language , " the liverpool university researcher said .
" colour symbolism is an abstraction and we can not work this abstraction without language ; so this is a proxy for trying to find in the archaeological record real echoes for the emergence of language , " dr barham told the british association 's science festival . "
archaeologists are a very cautious group " dr lawrence barham , liverpool university dr barham 's work over the past 10 years has majored on a site known as twin rivers , an old cave complex in the south of zambia .
it was occupied by humans some 170,000-300,000 years ago .
which type of human is not clear , however ; there is a fragment of bone which could belong to homo heidelbergensis , the ancestor of modern humans , which like us had a large brain .
bright range dr barham said the tools found at twin rivers showed evidence of increasing sophistication , with simple handaxes giving way to small blades and flakes that had to be attached to handles .
the emergence of this " composite " technology coincided with the systematic use of ochres .
ochre is a soft stone that contains iron oxides ; it comes in a range of colours .
at twin rivers there are red , yellow , brown , pink , black and even purple ochres .
if they are scraped , they will produce a powder which can be mixed with animal fat , for example , and used as a paint .
dr barham wonders if ancient humans in zambia wiped these pigments on their bodies , using them in rituals - just as paints are still used in some cultures today , to mark the passage of warrior to elder , or the coming of age of boys and girls .
the problem is that there are purely functional uses for this material as well , to preserve hides and as a glue to bind stone blades to their shafts .
chance creation " if you were to argue that these oxides were purely functional and have no symbolic value , you have to explain away the range of colours that are being selected from different places in the landscape , " said lawrence barham .
" because if it was just for the iron element , any of them would do - the red , or the yellow .
some are closer to the site than others , so it seems that people were deliberately selecting the material for the colour property .
that 's my argument anyway . "
a number of claims have previously been made for conceptual thinking in humans hundreds of thousands of years ago .
many of these claims relate to pieces of rock that are said to represent the human form .
the berekhat ram figure from israel and the tan-tan figure from morocco , for example , have been presented as the work of homo erectus .
but many sceptical researchers believe these items are merely accidents of nature ; they are objects that have been moulded into human form through chance geological processes .
and dr barham knows he has some way to go to convince colleagues of his case .
" archaeologists are a very cautious group .
we set high standards for accepting an interpretation based on symbolism , " he told bbc news .

lawrence barham has been studying tools and other artefacts left by ancient humans at a site in zambia .
he says the range of mineral pigments , or ochres , found there hints at the use of paint , perhaps to mark the body .
if correct , it would push back the earliest known example of abstract thinking by at least 100,000 years .
being able to conceptualise - the ability to let one thing represent another - was a giant leap in human evolution .
it was the mental activity that would eventually permit the development of sophisticated language and maths .
language proxy shells from israel that were strung as beads into a necklace or bracelet are widely accepted to be the oldest unequivocal evidence for such behaviour in humans .
' oldest jewellery ' revealed but dr barham said it would be hard to accept that humans were not engaged in such activity much earlier in the archaeological record .
" as an archaeologist i am interested to find out where colour symbolism first appears because for colour symbolism to work it must be attached to language , " the liverpool university researcher said .
" colour symbolism is an abstraction and we can not work this abstraction without language ; so this is a proxy for trying to find in the archaeological record real echoes for the emergence of language , " dr barham told the british association 's science festival .
archaeologists are a very cautious group dr lawrence barham , liverpool university dr barham 's work over the past 10 years has majored on a site known as twin rivers , an old cave complex in the south of zambia .
it was occupied by humans some 170,000-300,000 years ago .
which type of human is not clear , however ; there is a fragment of bone which could belong to homo heidelbergensis , the ancestor of modern humans , which like us had a large brain .
bright range dr barham said the tools found at twin rivers showed evidence of increasing sophistication , with simple handaxes giving way to small blades and flakes that had to be attached to handles .
the emergence of this " composite " technology coincided with the systematic use of ochres .
ochre is a soft stone that contains iron oxides ; it comes in a range of colours .
at twin rivers there are red , yellow , brown , pink , black and even purple ochres .
if they are scraped , they will produce a powder which can be mixed with animal fat , for example , and used as a paint .
dr barham wonders if ancient humans in zambia wiped these pigments on their bodies , using them in rituals - just as paints are still used in some cultures today , to mark the passage of warrior to elder , or the coming of age of boys and girls .
the problem is that there are purely functional uses for this material as well , to preserve hides and as a glue to bind stone blades to their shafts .
chance creation " if you were to argue that these oxides were purely functional and have no symbolic value , you have to explain away the range of colours that are being selected from different places in the landscape , " said lawrence barham .
" because if it was just for the iron element , any of them would do - the red , or the yellow .
some are closer to the site than others , so it seems that people were deliberately selecting the material for the colour property .
that 's my argument anyway . "
the zambian ochres could have been used to paint the skin a number of claims have previously been made for conceptual thinking in humans hundreds of thousands of years ago .
many of these claims relate to pieces of rock that are said to represent the human form .
the berekhat ram figure from israel and the tan-tan figure from morocco , for example , have been presented as the work of homo erectus .
but many sceptical researchers believe these items are merely accidents of nature ; they are objects that have been moulded into human form through chance geological processes .
and dr barham knows he has some way to go to convince colleagues of his case .
" archaeologists are a very cautious group .
we set high standards for accepting an interpretation based on symbolism , " he told bbc news .

thousands of flights were cancelled at heathrow and baa 's other uk airports after an alleged plot to blow up transatlantic flights was foiled .
tight security measures introduced after details of the plot emerged caused chaotic scenes at many airports .
ba , which criticised baa 's handling of security at the time , has already said flight cancellations cost it £ 40m .
compensation claim on tuesday baa , which operates heathrow , gatwick , stansted , glasgow and edinburgh airport among others , will outline the cost of the alert to its business when it publishes details of passenger figures for august .
the £ 20m figure is more than double the loss baa suffered as a result of last year 's industrial dispute at catering firm gate gourmet , where disruption was limited to heathrow .
following the alert on 10 august , passengers were barred from taking any hand luggage onto planes , except for one small plastic bag .
although the rules were subsequently relaxed , allowing people to carry one item of hand luggage the size of laptop computer on board , the security measures were fiercely criticised by airlines .
ryanair is seeking £ 3.3m in compensation from the government , claiming the restrictions were excessive , unevenly applied and damaged its business .
long-term concern ba , which cancelled more than 1,250 flights between 10 and 17 august , has also said it is considering seeking compensation .
the £ 20m cost of the alert represents only a small fraction of baa 's annual sales of more than £ 2bn a year .
but the impact the alert will have on people 's willingness to fly in the longer-term is harder to verify and remains a potential concern to baa 's owner , spanish company ferrovial .

the 23-year-old former miss wales became a household name for her appearance on the seventh series of channel 4 's big brother .
but although she spent almost three months in front of big brother cameras , she said she felt nervous stepping onto the tv soap 's set .
imogen appears as herself at the opening of a garage .
she was said to be delighted to be asked to appear on the long-running soap , which is set in the gwendraeth valley , near her hometown of llanelli .
imogen will join a long list of welsh stars to make guest appearances on the programme , including ray gravell , jonathan davies and max boyce .
the first episode was broadcast in 1974 , and is produced by bbc wales for s4c .
imogen plays a vip guest at the opening of a garage run by entrepreneur ronald steadman -lrb- wayne cater -rrb- and his trophy wife lucy -lrb- heledd baskerville -rrb- .
she said : " it 's great to be asked to appear on pobol y cwm .
" my family watch it , and i used to watch it when i was living at home . "
imogen said her ambition was to get into acting and presenting - but it seems she has yet to leave her big brother days behind her , as her lines in pobol y cwm included some of the words and catchphrases she became famous for on the show .
" i 've got some lines to say , and they 've even included the ' hot topic ' and a few ' babes ' as part of the script , " said imogen .
she said she felt nervous on the day of filming .
" there were so many people around , but the producers and other actors made me feel at home and talked me through the process , and i 'm really excited about it , " she added .
her fellow welsh housemate glyn wise from blaenau ffestiniog has also been making further tv appearances .

sainsbury 's , tesco and asda are all introducing new polish ranges , keen to tap into the substantial spending power of the uk 's growing polish communities .
items sold include borsch , meatballs , pickled vegetables and sauerkraut soup .
stores are expected to develop polish ready meals in the future to try to compete with specialist delicatessens .
many corner shops , especially in london , have begun stocking imported polish brands .
' diverse cuisine ' but the uk 's three largest supermarkets are all keen on a slice of the polish market , with many poles having significant disposable income and wanting to buy familiar foods .
sainsbury 's was one of the first to get its products onto the shelves , according to the sunday telegraph , offering 32 types of polish food last week .
the food is currently available in 11 stores including hendon in north london and luton in bedfordshire . "
the types of items that polish people miss the most are comfort foods such as soup , pickled cabbage and marshmallows covered with chocolate " martin koyce , tesco tesco will start selling its own polish range this week , ranging from borsch and salt sticks to delicacies such as cabbage-based dish golabki and flaki , a popular soup .
asda is expected to follow suit next month .
martin koyce , tesco 's ethnic project manager , told the sunday telegraph : " britain has long been known for its diverse taste in cuisine and this latest venture will only add to that experience .
" the types of items that polish people miss the most and that are in greatest demand are comfort foods such as soup , pickled cabbage and marshmallows covered with chocolate . "
about 230,000 poles registered for work in the uk between may 2004 and march 2006 , according to official figures .
but the actual number of poles living in the uk is thought to be much higher , with some estimates putting it as high as 600,000 .
