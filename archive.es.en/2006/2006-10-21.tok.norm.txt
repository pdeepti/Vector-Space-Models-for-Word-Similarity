" i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

" the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .
the defense ministry says it has no evidence that the allegations are true .
the german government said on wednesday that while there was proof of " verbal contact " between kurnaz and soldiers , it had found nothing to back up the more serious claims . in the newspaper interview , jung also called for an extension of the mandate for " enduring freedom , " the multinational military operation aimed at countering terrorism and bringing stability to afghanistan . " especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .
according to statements she made to the netzeitung internet news site , such a committee would act in a similar fashion as the information agency oversight committees , through which all parliamentary groups as well as political and military leaders are " regularly and comprehensively " apprised of events . the assurances of defense minister jung , that procedures has been put in place to prevent future communication breakdowns , such as those that occurred in the kurnaz case , did not satisfy beer .
she said the new procedures did not obviate the need for more oversight of the special forces . but jung defended the secrecy around the ksk , saying it was for the protection of the soldiers . " at the same time , i want to inform representatives of the defense committee more thoroughly , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen taliban tells of alleged abuse at german hands the german defense ministry is launching an investigation into alleged abuses after the man known as the bremen taliban revealed in an interview that german special forces troops tortured him in an afghanistan prison .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action .

imprisoned by the nazis , he later became a tv celebrity . father laurentius siemer was repeatedly imprisoned by the gestapo beginning in 1935 .
as a leader in the dominican order , he was later hunted down by the nazis , who believed he was a co-conspirator in the attempted assassination of adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
siemer managed to flee and escape certain death . following the war , siemer was a government consultant who helped draft the german constitution .
he also established the walberberg institute , an educational center for young people in a convent near bonn .
known for his quick wit , he was both a strong advocate of " christian socialism " and a popular tv talk show guest known as the " tv father .

" in order to destroy the good reputation of the dominicans , the nazis accused them of fraud , " she said . father laurentius spent three months in a cologne prison before being transferred to a jail in oldenburg .
his lawyer managed to eventually force his release . laurentius 's co-defendents and long-time friends , thomas stuhlweissenburg and titus horten , also dominicans , did not survive imprisonment . following his release from jail , siemer travelled to rome in 1937 , and then around the world , with stops in sri lanka , china and the united states . gestapo onslaught in 1940 , the gestapo began their onslaught on catholic monasteries , which were searched , appropriated and sometimes transformed into military hospitals . " many gestapo reports stated that dominicans were papal stormtroopers and therefore had to be annihilated , " said father rainer maria groothuis , author of the book " serving a supranational power - german dominicans during the nazi regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2006 german politicians ban import of seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harp seals are among those hunted germany 's parliament has passed a motion banning the import of seal products and sets as a larger goal an eu-wide ban .
lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " putin was blowing hot and cold , " as he so often does during his trips to europe , one european diplomat said . " open and frank " prime minister matti vanhanen of finland , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the talks with putin " open and frank .

" we will only succeed in getting back on track by dint of a joint effort , " steinmeier said .
" i hope that in the coming months we will be able to convince the sceptics to take up anew the ratification process .

but it might get a little less fun this year as one state issues a stern warning about the health risks of christmas treats . north rhine-westphalia , germany ' most populous state and one known for its love of a good party , this week issued a somewhat scrooge-ish health warning guaranteed to put a damper on the christmas spirit . no more spicy cookies , it said - they can cause liver damage . humbug !
yuletide in germany is all about excessive consumption , especially of cinnamon cakes washed down with generous quantities of mulled wine .
how dangerous can a " lebkuchen " be ? according to the consumer protection ministry in the state , often referred to by its initials nrw , very .
it advised parents to curb their children 's intake of cinnamon stars , because of an aromatic substance called cumarin which occurs naturally in the seasonal spice . homemade is n't always healthy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they can look , but they ca n't touch the federal risk assessment agency -lrb- bfr -rrb- agreed , telling consumers : " just because granny baked with it , does n't mean it 's harmless . " the agency advised parents to limit their children to three cinnamon stars a day and told adults not to indulge in more than 15 of the biscuits in one sitting . what next ?

-lrb- 25.12.2005 -rrb- german christmas culinary traditions endure crispy goose or suger-covered raisin cake : good food belongs to german christmas celebrations as much as the christmas tree .
and many a traditional dish dates back to medieval times or even earlier .

it seems that some germans love to rock around the christmas tree - but without annoying relatives being there .
a recent survey shows that christmas trees are more essential to a good time than family .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

a former prisoner has said he suffered abuse by members of the force . jung told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he wanted to prevent the reputation of the special unit , called ksk , from being blackened . " the events , which are now five years old , will be cleared up , " he said in an interview .
" -lrb- the unit -rrb- is important for germany 's security and for the security of germany soldiers abroad . " the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .
the defense ministry says it has no evidence that the allegations are true .
the german government said on wednesday that while there was proof of " verbal contact " between kurnaz and soldiers , it had found nothing to back up the more serious claims . in the newspaper interview , jung also called for an extension of the mandate for " enduring freedom , " the multinational military operation aimed at countering terrorism and bringing stability to afghanistan . " especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .
according to statements she made to the netzeitung internet news site , such a committee would act in a similar fashion as the information agency oversight committees , through which all parliamentary groups as well as political and military leaders are " regularly and comprehensively " apprised of events . the assurances of defense minister jung , that procedures has been put in place to prevent future communication breakdowns , such as those that occurred in the kurnaz case , did not satisfy beer .
she said the new procedures did not obviate the need for more oversight of the special forces . but jung defended the secrecy around the ksk , saying it was for the protection of the soldiers .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " putin was blowing hot and cold , " as he so often does during his trips to europe , one european diplomat said .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " putin was blowing hot and cold , " as he so often does during his trips to europe , one european diplomat said . " open and frank " prime minister matti vanhanen of finland , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the talks with putin " open and frank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads of state and governments gathered for a photo he added that the 25 had not shied away from tackling putin on other sensitive issues including the murder of journalist anna politkovskaya , which has concerned human rights groups , and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice . vanhanen and barroso , who shared the press conference with putin , stressed the need for a mutually beneficial relationship with russia , which could encompass the key issues of iran and north korea . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to press putin on energy the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2006 german politicians ban import of seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harp seals are among those hunted germany 's parliament has passed a motion banning the import of seal products and sets as a larger goal an eu-wide ban .
lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " putin was blowing hot and cold , " as he so often does during his trips to europe , one european diplomat said . " open and frank " prime minister matti vanhanen of finland , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the talks with putin " open and frank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads of state and governments gathered for a photo he added that the 25 had not shied away from tackling putin on other sensitive issues including the murder of journalist anna politkovskaya , which has concerned human rights groups , and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice . vanhanen and barroso , who shared the press conference with putin , stressed the need for a mutually beneficial relationship with russia , which could encompass the key issues of iran and north korea . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to press putin on energy the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .

imprisoned by the nazis , he later became a tv celebrity . father laurentius siemer was repeatedly imprisoned by the gestapo beginning in 1935 .
as a leader in the dominican order , he was later hunted down by the nazis , who believed he was a co-conspirator in the attempted assassination of adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
siemer managed to flee and escape certain death . following the war , siemer was a government consultant who helped draft the german constitution .
he also established the walberberg institute , an educational center for young people in a convent near bonn .
known for his quick wit , he was both a strong advocate of " christian socialism " and a popular tv talk show guest known as the " tv father .

he astounded his relatives when he decided to enter the " order of preachers , " more commonly known as the dominican order . there , he studied philosophy and theology and was ordained a priest - " father laurentius " - in 1914 . he became rector of the order 's high school in vechta in 1921 , and was elected provincial of the dominican province of teutonia in 1932 . siemer eventually became a steadfast opponent of the nazi regime .
he called on catholics not to adhere to the cultural currents of the time , but instead , to live by the principles of their religion . priests as criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ceremonies honor resistance fighters who tried to kill hitler in 1935 , the gestapo arrested siemer in cologne during the so-called " currency fraud cases . " " the dominican order dramatically influenced catholics in their philosophical views , " said maria anna zumholz of the institute for historical regional research at the university of vechta . " in order to destroy the good reputation of the dominicans , the nazis accused them of fraud , " she said . father laurentius spent three months in a cologne prison before being transferred to a jail in oldenburg .
his lawyer managed to eventually force his release . laurentius 's co-defendents and long-time friends , thomas stuhlweissenburg and titus horten , also dominicans , did not survive imprisonment . following his release from jail , siemer travelled to rome in 1937 , and then around the world , with stops in sri lanka , china and the united states . gestapo onslaught in 1940 , the gestapo began their onslaught on catholic monasteries , which were searched , appropriated and sometimes transformed into military hospitals . " many gestapo reports stated that dominicans were papal stormtroopers and therefore had to be annihilated , " said father rainer maria groothuis , author of the book " serving a supranational power - german dominicans during the nazi regime .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

" -lrb- the unit -rrb- is important for germany 's security and for the security of germany soldiers abroad . " the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .

" especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .
according to statements she made to the netzeitung internet news site , such a committee would act in a similar fashion as the information agency oversight committees , through which all parliamentary groups as well as political and military leaders are " regularly and comprehensively " apprised of events . the assurances of defense minister jung , that procedures has been put in place to prevent future communication breakdowns , such as those that occurred in the kurnaz case , did not satisfy beer .
she said the new procedures did not obviate the need for more oversight of the special forces . but jung defended the secrecy around the ksk , saying it was for the protection of the soldiers .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes .

a former prisoner has said he suffered abuse by members of the force . jung told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he wanted to prevent the reputation of the special unit , called ksk , from being blackened . " the events , which are now five years old , will be cleared up , " he said in an interview .
" -lrb- the unit -rrb- is important for germany 's security and for the security of germany soldiers abroad . " the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .
the defense ministry says it has no evidence that the allegations are true .
the german government said on wednesday that while there was proof of " verbal contact " between kurnaz and soldiers , it had found nothing to back up the more serious claims . in the newspaper interview , jung also called for an extension of the mandate for " enduring freedom , " the multinational military operation aimed at countering terrorism and bringing stability to afghanistan . " especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .

" " the dominican order dramatically influenced catholics in their philosophical views , " said maria anna zumholz of the institute for historical regional research at the university of vechta . " in order to destroy the good reputation of the dominicans , the nazis accused them of fraud , " she said . father laurentius spent three months in a cologne prison before being transferred to a jail in oldenburg .
his lawyer managed to eventually force his release . laurentius 's co-defendents and long-time friends , thomas stuhlweissenburg and titus horten , also dominicans , did not survive imprisonment . following his release from jail , siemer travelled to rome in 1937 , and then around the world , with stops in sri lanka , china and the united states . gestapo onslaught in 1940 , the gestapo began their onslaught on catholic monasteries , which were searched , appropriated and sometimes transformed into military hospitals . " many gestapo reports stated that dominicans were papal stormtroopers and therefore had to be annihilated , " said father rainer maria groothuis , author of the book " serving a supranational power - german dominicans during the nazi regime . " " that was the decisive goal of the regime , not just against the dominicans , but effectively , against all orders , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memory of father laurentius siemer lives on laurentius became increasingly involved in the resistance movement in germany , but he kept many of his activities secret from his fellow dominicans so as not to implicate them . after the failure of the assassination attempt against hitler on july 20 , 1944 and the executions of nearly all of his co-conspirators , father laurentius found himself on the gestapo 's death list . yet when the nazi secret police appeared on his monastery 's doorstep in his native oldenburg region on september 16 , he evaded arrest .
while a fellow priest distracted gestapo officers at the front gate , siemer fled out the back door and into a neighboring barn . although the nazis sought him throughout the country , father laurentius survived in a hideout until the end of the war . angelika ditscheid -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french memorial honors wwii resistance fighters a new memorial to european resistance fighters who were deported to their deaths during world war ii opened thursday on the site of the only nazi concentration camp on french soil .

yuletide in germany is all about excessive consumption , especially of cinnamon cakes washed down with generous quantities of mulled wine .
how dangerous can a " lebkuchen " be ? according to the consumer protection ministry in the state , often referred to by its initials nrw , very .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.10.2006 german politicians ban import of seal products großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harp seals are among those hunted germany 's parliament has passed a motion banning the import of seal products and sets as a larger goal an eu-wide ban .
lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso .

a former prisoner has said he suffered abuse by members of the force . jung told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he wanted to prevent the reputation of the special unit , called ksk , from being blackened . " the events , which are now five years old , will be cleared up , " he said in an interview .
" -lrb- the unit -rrb- is important for germany 's security and for the security of germany soldiers abroad . " the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .
the defense ministry says it has no evidence that the allegations are true .
the german government said on wednesday that while there was proof of " verbal contact " between kurnaz and soldiers , it had found nothing to back up the more serious claims . in the newspaper interview , jung also called for an extension of the mandate for " enduring freedom , " the multinational military operation aimed at countering terrorism and bringing stability to afghanistan . " especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .
according to statements she made to the netzeitung internet news site , such a committee would act in a similar fashion as the information agency oversight committees , through which all parliamentary groups as well as political and military leaders are " regularly and comprehensively " apprised of events . the assurances of defense minister jung , that procedures has been put in place to prevent future communication breakdowns , such as those that occurred in the kurnaz case , did not satisfy beer .
she said the new procedures did not obviate the need for more oversight of the special forces . but jung defended the secrecy around the ksk , saying it was for the protection of the soldiers .

lawmkers said the methods used to kill seals were brutal . the vote for the ban on thursday night was unanimous and eliminates the german market from the commercial seal trade .
many german parliamentarians also now want to see a ban on seal products and have drafted a proposal for a ban european-wide ban hundreds of thousands of seals are killed around the globe annually .
in canada , 350,000 animals have been killed this year .
laws do exist to protect seals , but they only apply to new-born pups .
older seals are can be hunted legally . opposition to the hunt has prompted the eu to take steps to halt the trade in seal products .
last month the eu parliament passed a resolution in support of an eu-wide trade ban . animal rights groups , including the german office of the international fund for animal welfare , hailed the decision . " this decision by the german parliament is very significant in its own right , but also in that germany will be presiding over the eu-presidency in the first half of 2007 , " said ralf sonntag , the group 's director .
" germany should use this leadership role to push for a europe-wide ban on seal products . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pups are particularly fluffy bärbel höhn , the green party 's deputy faction leader in parliament , campaigned for the ban , and said she abhors the methods used to skin seals . " the seal pups ca n't even swim yet , " she said .
" the hunters wait just a few weeks after they are born until the color of their fur changes , then they beat them over the heads and often skin them alive . " she said that studies show that up to 40 percent of the animals have not been hurt enough to be spared of pain . seal harvest höhn flew to canada in the spring with an animal rights organization to witness seal hunts , which are a big business for canada . according to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- , the seal hunt there brought $ 14.5 million -lrb- 11.6 million euros -rrb- in revenue to canada last year . fishermen sell blubber for oil and the seal pelts , largely for the fashion industry , to european countries like norway , russia and china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first day of seal hunt season last year in canada german firms also import several thousand seal furs every year . canadian prime minister stephen harper said the cull is an economic necessity for many fishermen , and that hunters do not harvest pups . " i think unfortunately we 're partially the victim of a bit of an international propaganda campaign , " harper also said .
" we believe that the country is acting responsibly and we 'll make sure all rules are enforced . " many animal protection groups disagree , however . " some seal hunters earn a bit of pocket money with this seal hunt and do n't want to lose that , " said sonntag . " seal hunters still maintain that the seals eat too much fish and that they 're responsible for the depletion of the cod stocks , " he added .
" but this argument has not been substantiated by research in any way . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal carcasses are often left behind according to the ap , the canadian government maintains canada 's seal population is abundant - with nearly 6 million in the arctic north and maritime provinces . regulations require the sealers to quickly kill the seals with a pick or bullet to the brain .
the pups also must be over three weeks old and have shed their white downy fur before being killed . a ban in sight ? german politicians who advocate a european-wide ban want the hunt to stop . " the decisive point is that i think germany should do everything possible to stop this cull , " said höhn .
" we ca n't force the canadians to ban the hunt , but we can make sure that products from these animals are not sold in germany . " other countries like the netherlands and belgium have already introduced these measures , she said , with italy having declared a moratorium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seal pelts are lucrative business for canadian fishermen some in the fur industry , however , say there 's no need for a new law in germany .
" we do n't need the scope of the law to be extended , at least not here in germany , because we do n't make anything from seal fur , " said fur designer olaf fechner . fechner said he 's been self-employed since 1979 and has n't made a single seal fur coat in that time . " there 's no demand for it here in germany , so it 's stupid to be discussing it .
i think sometimes politicians are just interested in raising their profiles .
maybe they should concern themselves with other things - we have so many problems here , " he said .
fechner did say , however , that the proposed law could put jobs at risk .

they were seeking assurances from putin of a secure energy supply and a more open energy market . on these issues diplomats voiced some satisfaction , but their attempt to persuade putin to bring down the tension with neighboring georgia failed spectacularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgian soldiers " the issue does not lie between russia and georgia , the issue is between georgia and south ossetia and abkhazia , " putin said .
" to our regret and fear , it is heading for a bloodbath .
georgia wants to resolve the disputes with military action . " he said that the recent deterioration of relations between moscow and tbilisi , sparked by georgia 's arrest of four russian army officers on spying charges , had been fabricated for political purposes . " the initiative to worsen relations originated not from russia , " he added . his comments were " not really surprising , " according to a european diplomat , who categorised them as " verbal rhetoric . " abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s when the abkhaz and ossetian ethnic groups revolted against central georgian rule , resulting in the mass expulsion of ethnic georgians . russia has warned that it would defend the separatist territories if the georgian government launched an assault to win back control . energy concerns eased taking a more diplomatic line , putin gave his backing to energy cooperation with the eu on the basis of " common principles . " " i would like cooperation to be not only mutually beneficial but that it be founded on common principles , " putin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin speaks during a final press conference in lahti , finland the european union , which gets a quarter of its gas and oil from russia , was eager to receive guarantees over energy supplies on the basis , as european commission president jose manuel barroso put it , of reciprocity , transparency and market opening , while not " over-politicizing " debate about relations between russia and the bloc . the europeans are concerned about russia 's recent decision to develop the huge shtokman gas field without foreign partners , and threats to halt a project off russia 's pacific coast run by anglo-dutch energy giant shell on environmental grounds . on shtokman , putin said that the russian gas monopoly gazprom 's decision to develop the vast gas field without foreign partners did not mean that the investment rules had changed in russia . putin said he agreed with french counterpart jacques chirac , in judging that the eu russia energy issue is a " joint problem " which requires " a joint solution . " " we should not let energy divide europe and russia as communism once did , " echoed european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " putin was blowing hot and cold , " as he so often does during his trips to europe , one european diplomat said . " open and frank " prime minister matti vanhanen of finland , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , called the talks with putin " open and frank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads of state and governments gathered for a photo he added that the 25 had not shied away from tackling putin on other sensitive issues including the murder of journalist anna politkovskaya , which has concerned human rights groups , and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice . vanhanen and barroso , who shared the press conference with putin , stressed the need for a mutually beneficial relationship with russia , which could encompass the key issues of iran and north korea . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders to press putin on energy the 25 eu heads of state or government assemble in the finnish town of lahti on friday for a meeting focused on energy policy and relations with russia .

imprisoned by the nazis , he later became a tv celebrity . father laurentius siemer was repeatedly imprisoned by the gestapo beginning in 1935 .
as a leader in the dominican order , he was later hunted down by the nazis , who believed he was a co-conspirator in the attempted assassination of adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
siemer managed to flee and escape certain death . following the war , siemer was a government consultant who helped draft the german constitution .
he also established the walberberg institute , an educational center for young people in a convent near bonn .
known for his quick wit , he was both a strong advocate of " christian socialism " and a popular tv talk show guest known as the " tv father . " entering the order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemer was a spiritual leader both in his order and in the resistance but siemer surprised people long before he became a nazi resistor and tv celebrity . born as " josef siemer " into a large family on march 8 , 1888 in northern germany .
he astounded his relatives when he decided to enter the " order of preachers , " more commonly known as the dominican order . there , he studied philosophy and theology and was ordained a priest - " father laurentius " - in 1914 . he became rector of the order 's high school in vechta in 1921 , and was elected provincial of the dominican province of teutonia in 1932 . siemer eventually became a steadfast opponent of the nazi regime .
he called on catholics not to adhere to the cultural currents of the time , but instead , to live by the principles of their religion . priests as criminals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern ceremonies honor resistance fighters who tried to kill hitler in 1935 , the gestapo arrested siemer in cologne during the so-called " currency fraud cases . " " the dominican order dramatically influenced catholics in their philosophical views , " said maria anna zumholz of the institute for historical regional research at the university of vechta . " in order to destroy the good reputation of the dominicans , the nazis accused them of fraud , " she said . father laurentius spent three months in a cologne prison before being transferred to a jail in oldenburg .
his lawyer managed to eventually force his release . laurentius 's co-defendents and long-time friends , thomas stuhlweissenburg and titus horten , also dominicans , did not survive imprisonment . following his release from jail , siemer travelled to rome in 1937 , and then around the world , with stops in sri lanka , china and the united states . gestapo onslaught in 1940 , the gestapo began their onslaught on catholic monasteries , which were searched , appropriated and sometimes transformed into military hospitals . " many gestapo reports stated that dominicans were papal stormtroopers and therefore had to be annihilated , " said father rainer maria groothuis , author of the book " serving a supranational power - german dominicans during the nazi regime . " " that was the decisive goal of the regime , not just against the dominicans , but effectively , against all orders , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memory of father laurentius siemer lives on laurentius became increasingly involved in the resistance movement in germany , but he kept many of his activities secret from his fellow dominicans so as not to implicate them . after the failure of the assassination attempt against hitler on july 20 , 1944 and the executions of nearly all of his co-conspirators , father laurentius found himself on the gestapo 's death list . yet when the nazi secret police appeared on his monastery 's doorstep in his native oldenburg region on september 16 , he evaded arrest .
while a fellow priest distracted gestapo officers at the front gate , siemer fled out the back door and into a neighboring barn . although the nazis sought him throughout the country , father laurentius survived in a hideout until the end of the war . angelika ditscheid -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french memorial honors wwii resistance fighters a new memorial to european resistance fighters who were deported to their deaths during world war ii opened thursday on the site of the only nazi concentration camp on french soil .

a former prisoner has said he suffered abuse by members of the force . jung told the welt am sonntag newspaper that he wanted to prevent the reputation of the special unit , called ksk , from being blackened . " the events , which are now five years old , will be cleared up , " he said in an interview .
" -lrb- the unit -rrb- is important for germany 's security and for the security of germany soldiers abroad . " the elite unit , whose activities are often kept secret , has found itself in the headlines due to the allegations of murat kurnaz , a german-born turk who claimed earlier this month that two german soldiers came to interrogate him at a camp near the southern afghan city of kandahar in 2002 and slammed his head into the ground . kurnaz had been arrested by us forces in pakistan shortly after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states and transferred to a us prison in kandahar before being incarcerated in the us guantanamo bay jail , where he was held for four years . he was released this year because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister jung , center , on a visit to german troops in afghanistan .
the defense ministry says it has no evidence that the allegations are true .
the german government said on wednesday that while there was proof of " verbal contact " between kurnaz and soldiers , it had found nothing to back up the more serious claims . in the newspaper interview , jung also called for an extension of the mandate for " enduring freedom , " the multinational military operation aimed at countering terrorism and bringing stability to afghanistan . " especially in view of the tense security situation in afghanistan , it would be negligent not to extend the mandate , " he said . investigation and calls for more oversight on thursday , senior members of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government said the parliament 's defense committee announced it would conduct an investigation into the matter . " the accusations that kurnaz has made against members of the army 's ksk special forces must be cleared up quickly and without reserve , " merkel 's christian democrats and their coalition partners , the social democrats , said in a joint statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angelika beer but the green party 's spokesperson for defense issues , angelika beer , has demanded an oversight committee be formed to look at the unit 's missions .
according to statements she made to the netzeitung internet news site , such a committee would act in a similar fashion as the information agency oversight committees , through which all parliamentary groups as well as political and military leaders are " regularly and comprehensively " apprised of events . the assurances of defense minister jung , that procedures has been put in place to prevent future communication breakdowns , such as those that occurred in the kurnaz case , did not satisfy beer .
she said the new procedures did not obviate the need for more oversight of the special forces . but jung defended the secrecy around the ksk , saying it was for the protection of the soldiers . " at the same time , i want to inform representatives of the defense committee more thoroughly , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen taliban tells of alleged abuse at german hands the german defense ministry is launching an investigation into alleged abuses after the man known as the bremen taliban revealed in an interview that german special forces troops tortured him in an afghanistan prison .

but soon the tell-tale flames of gas being flared are visible above the trees around us and we reach the first isolated cluster of machinery and pipes drawing the gas out of the ground and transporting it across russia and beyond .
europe 's worries the workers , wrapped in heavy winter clothing , move slowly across the site through the thick snow which marks just the beginning of the long months of extreme cold .
they are probably not aware of it , but those working in the energy sector here in this bleak region of siberia have now become indispensable to many countries across europe .
mr putin told eu leaders russia was a reliable energy supplier some of the world 's largest gas fields can be found here and a significant proportion of the gas is sold to the european union .
but as europe becomes ever more dependent on russian gas , leading energy analysts have told the bbc they are worried that russia will not be able to meet the growing demand .
' chronic underinvestment ' they say the huge state-controlled company , gazprom , which provides around 90 % of russian gas supplies , has not been investing enough in future production and infrastructure .
according to the international energy agency , gazprom has commissioned just one new gas field in 20 years .
and it says that could lead to a shortfall because three of the company 's most important fields here in western siberia are now in decline .
" there could be quite a large gap between what europe needs and what gazprom is able to produce , assuming there is no investment in new production , " one analyst told the bbc .
" the russian gas sector is chronically underinvested and it 's becoming worse and worse , " confirms sergei medvedev of the moscow school of economics .
" especially as gazprom is embarking upon big imperialist designs with big investments overseas -lsb- in countries like -rsb- bolivia and venezuela .
they 're diverting the much needed investment from the domestic production sector , from exploring new fields .
" so europe has really to be cautious about the safety of russian gas supplies , " mr medvedev says .
' gas wars ' europe 's faith in the reliability of russia as an energy supplier has already been shaken in many different ways over the past 11 months .
at the beginning of the year there was the price dispute between moscow and ukraine which led to gazprom briefly shutting off gas supplies - a drastic move which had a knock-on effect on europe .
there have also been statements by russian officials about their increasing interest in exporting gas and oil to asian markets , stoking fears that europe could lose out .
and earlier this month , there was the shock announcement that gazprom would develop the world 's largest offshore gas field , shtokman , without any foreign energy companies as partners .
it is little surprise then that russian president vladimir putin was invited to meet eu leaders in finland with energy the main subject on the agenda .
' in powerful position ' they are pressuring him to liberalise the russian energy sector and allow much great foreign involvement in particular to end gazprom 's monopoly over the pipeline network .
but president putin knows he is in a powerful position .
his country sits on a quarter of the world 's gas reserves .
and within 20 years europe will need to import 80 % of its gas .
according to russian analysts , eu leaders need to offer him something in return .
and that could mean allowing gazprom , which is already the world 's largest gas company , greater freedom to buy major energy companies and distribution networks in europe .
such a move that would greatly increase russia 's influence across the region .

in mid-winter there is permanent night as the temperature plummets to -50c .
in mid-summer there is permanent day accompanied by tropical heat and swarms of mosquitoes .
for many this would be the precise definition of hell on earth .
but the town has a quiet , contented atmosphere .
the buildings are modern and well-kept .
there are smart office blocks .
" people love this land , people are proud of it , " says elena who lived here for many years .
gas fields the reason for such unexpected delight lies beneath the ground .
around tarko-sale lie vast gas fields which have transformed life for much of the local population over the past 10 years , bringing jobs and the money for good schools and colleges .
gazprom 's imposing hq is testament to its commercial power to reach the fields requires a further journey across the desolate , frozen plains of siberia with their stunted , apparently lifeless trees .
it is not easy .
our helicopter can not fly because of the weather conditions and the pontoon bridge across a large semi-frozen river has not been completed .
we have to transfer onto a small boat .
but soon the tell-tale flames of gas being flared are visible above the trees around us and we reach the first isolated cluster of machinery and pipes drawing the gas out of the ground and transporting it across russia and beyond .
europe 's worries the workers , wrapped in heavy winter clothing , move slowly across the site through the thick snow which marks just the beginning of the long months of extreme cold .
they are probably not aware of it , but those working in the energy sector here in this bleak region of siberia have now become indispensable to many countries across europe .
mr putin told eu leaders russia was a reliable energy supplier some of the world 's largest gas fields can be found here and a significant proportion of the gas is sold to the european union .
but as europe becomes ever more dependent on russian gas , leading energy analysts have told the bbc they are worried that russia will not be able to meet the growing demand .
' chronic underinvestment ' they say the huge state-controlled company , gazprom , which provides around 90 % of russian gas supplies , has not been investing enough in future production and infrastructure .
according to the international energy agency , gazprom has commissioned just one new gas field in 20 years .
and it says that could lead to a shortfall because three of the company 's most important fields here in western siberia are now in decline .
" there could be quite a large gap between what europe needs and what gazprom is able to produce , assuming there is no investment in new production , " one analyst told the bbc .
" the russian gas sector is chronically underinvested and it 's becoming worse and worse , " confirms sergei medvedev of the moscow school of economics .
" especially as gazprom is embarking upon big imperialist designs with big investments overseas -lsb- in countries like -rsb- bolivia and venezuela .
they 're diverting the much needed investment from the domestic production sector , from exploring new fields .
" so europe has really to be cautious about the safety of russian gas supplies , " mr medvedev says .
' gas wars ' europe 's faith in the reliability of russia as an energy supplier has already been shaken in many different ways over the past 11 months .
at the beginning of the year there was the price dispute between moscow and ukraine which led to gazprom briefly shutting off gas supplies - a drastic move which had a knock-on effect on europe .
there have also been statements by russian officials about their increasing interest in exporting gas and oil to asian markets , stoking fears that europe could lose out .
and earlier this month , there was the shock announcement that gazprom would develop the world 's largest offshore gas field , shtokman , without any foreign energy companies as partners .
it is little surprise then that russian president vladimir putin was invited to meet eu leaders in finland with energy the main subject on the agenda .
' in powerful position ' they are pressuring him to liberalise the russian energy sector and allow much great foreign involvement in particular to end gazprom 's monopoly over the pipeline network .
but president putin knows he is in a powerful position .
his country sits on a quarter of the world 's gas reserves .
and within 20 years europe will need to import 80 % of its gas .
according to russian analysts , eu leaders need to offer him something in return .
and that could mean allowing gazprom , which is already the world 's largest gas company , greater freedom to buy major energy companies and distribution networks in europe .
such a move that would greatly increase russia 's influence across the region .

during the 2005-6 season , 62 swansea supporters were arrested , up from 28 the previous season , and more than any other league one club .
cardiff city is no longer the league club with the most fans subject to football banning orders , with the total falling from 152 to 109 .
last season 19 wrexham supporters were arrested , down from 22 in 2004-5 .
across the premiership and football league there were 2,651 football-related arrests - down from 2,787 the previous season and the lowest total in more than a decade .
banning orders 2005-6 cardiff city - 109 -lrb- 22 in 2004-5 -rrb- swansea city - 28 -lrb- 16 -rrb- wrexham - 46 -lrb- 14 -rrb- the club with the highest number of arrests was tottenham hotspur with 169 , followed by manchester united -lrb- 147 -rrb- , chelsea -lrb- 126 -rrb- , sheffield wednesday -lrb- 89 -rrb- , coventry city -lrb- 88 -rrb- and leeds united -lrb- 76 -rrb- .
swansea city 's arrest figure of 62 was more than double its previous season 's total of 28 and higher than any other club in league one .
the club said heightened security at its new liberty stadium had contributed to the riser in arrests .
a spokesman said : " as a club we are pleased that the overall trend throughout the football league highlights a decrease in football-related arrests .
" as far as swansea city is concerned , one arrest is too many .
" last season 's increase is primarily down to the added security measures put in place for our first season at the liberty stadium .
" as a club we will therefore not tolerate any behaviour which will jeopardise the enjoyment of other supporters , especially families .
" we are confident that our figures for football-related arrests will decrease significantly over the current season now that the new security measures are well established with our supporters , the vast majority of whom have been a credit to the club . "
arrests 2005-6 cardiff city - 55 -lrb- 77 in 2004-5 -rrb- swansea city - 62 -lrb- 28 -rrb- wrexham - 19 -lrb- 22 -rrb- in 2004-5 , 152 cardiff supporters were banned from football grounds , and that has fallen to 109 - behind leeds united -lrb- 115 -rrb- and portsmouth -lrb- 110 -rrb- .
a total of 22 cardiff fans were added to the banned list in 2005-6 , while 75 saw their bans expire .
there were also fewer arrests involving cardiff fans , with 55 arrested in 2005-6 compared to 77 the previous season .
no-one from the club was available to comment , but vince alm , spokesman for the cardiff city supporters ' club , said there had been a long-term improvement in bluebirds fans ' behaviour .
he added : " we were always top of the league for banning orders because we had so many banned between 2000 and 2002 .
" but those bans have now ended so the figures are falling and they will continue to come down over the next few years .
" we 've been saying for a long time that we 've been getting our house in order and now we 're no different from any other football club .
" it 's the result of hard work by the fans in partnership with the police and the club and now we 're seeing the fruition of it .
" there are still a few people being banned , but it 's for things like drunkenness rather than violence .
" i just do n't see violent incidents anymore . "
during 2005-6 , 19 wrexham fans were arrested , three fewer than the previous season , but 46 of their supporters have banning orders - the highest total in league two .

cardiff city is no longer the league club with the most fans subject to football banning orders , with the total falling from 152 to 109 .
last season 19 wrexham supporters were arrested , down from 22 in 2004-5 .

swansea city 's arrest figure of 62 was more than double its previous season 's total of 28 and higher than any other club in league one .
the club said heightened security at its new liberty stadium had contributed to the riser in arrests .
a spokesman said : " as a club we are pleased that the overall trend throughout the football league highlights a decrease in football-related arrests .
arrests have fallen among cardiff city supporters " as far as swansea city is concerned , one arrest is too many .
" last season 's increase is primarily down to the added security measures put in place for our first season at the liberty stadium .
" as a club we will therefore not tolerate any behaviour which will jeopardise the enjoyment of other supporters , especially families .
" we are confident that our figures for football-related arrests will decrease significantly over the current season now that the new security measures are well established with our supporters , the vast majority of whom have been a credit to the club . "

a total of 22 cardiff fans were added to the banned list in 2005-6 , while 75 saw their bans expire .
there were also fewer arrests involving cardiff fans , with 55 arrested in 2005-6 compared to 77 the previous season .
no-one from the club was available to comment , but vince alm , spokesman for the cardiff city supporters ' club , said there had been a long-term improvement in bluebirds fans ' behaviour .
he added : " we were always top of the league for banning orders because we had so many banned between 2000 and 2002 .
" but those bans have now ended so the figures are falling and they will continue to come down over the next few years .
" we 've been saying for a long time that we 've been getting our house in order and now we 're no different from any other football club .

" there are still a few people being banned , but it 's for things like drunkenness rather than violence .
" i just do n't see violent incidents anymore . "
during 2005-6 , 19 wrexham fans were arrested , three fewer than the previous season , but 46 of their supporters have banning orders - the highest total in league two .

the tip slide onto the south wales village left 116 children and 28 adults dead .
he told bbc wales reporter melanie doel how he remembers events unfolding on that day .
md how were you alerted to the story and what was your initial reaction to being sent on such a story ?
jh i was sitting in the newsroom at what used to be called television wales and west -lrb- tww -rrb- .
we got a bit of wire service copy coming in saying there had been a tip slide at merthyr vale and a school had been affected .
to be honest i did n't think much of it because that sort of thing was happening all the time in the welsh valleys .
it was a quiet news morning and i knew the area well so i jumped in the mini and drove up .
there were lots of people women standing on their front door steps sort of looking up the valley - you just got the sense , i felt , and i said so at the time , that something big had happened .
of course i did n't know what it was .
we did n't even know whether anybody had been killed at that stage , but you could feel it .
md when you got there , can you describe the scene that met you ?
jh i did n't recognise aberfan .
i knew merthyr vale and aberfan very well .
i 'd worked in merthyr for years .
i had one of my closest friends living in merthyr vale .
his father worked in the pit and i had stayed in his house many times , which looked over the school .
when i drove down , as far as it was possible to drive into aberfan , i did n't know where i was .
i simply could not reconcile what i was seeing with what i remembered .
there was just this great mass of muck and filth and utter chaos , and it was terribly , terribly difficult to make any sense of it at all .
i think partly one 's brain refuses to recognise what one 's eyes were seeing .
md you got very close to parents in your reporting .
how difficult was it to see them digging for their own children ?
jh you saw the men digging , lots of them stripped to the waist .
the knowledge that they were digging for their own children was indescribably awful .
they 'd rushed up from the coal face obviously the moment they heard what happened .
their faces were still covered in coal dust and there were streaks of white running down their faces - sweat , and tears .
it was ghastly beyond belief .
every so often somebody would shout for silence because they thought they heard the sound of a child crying out .
everybody stopped digging the moment they said that .
there was absolute silence and you all stood there waiting .
mercifully sometimes it was the cry of a child and they were able to dig down .
some children were brought out alive - but too many were n't .
md how difficult was it to remain detached - was there a time you thought , ' i ca n't do this , i just want to help and become part of the rescue ' ?
jh no , i do n't think i ever felt -lsb- that -rsb- .
these men knew what they were doing .
they were skilled miners and it would have been presumptuous and very silly to want to get involved .
but of course one felt a part of it , just as a human being , whether you lived in that community and knew these people or not .
i had lived there and did know them .
i drunk many evenings away in the club at merthyr vale and aberfan .
what was important , as the days and months went by , was the world knew what happened and more importantly why it happened , because it did n't need to have happened .
in spite of the lies we were told at the time , warnings had been given .
the men who were looking after that tip knew that there were dangers , and they were not listened to .
that was an utter disgrace - which shamed the whole national coal board then and does to this day .we should all hang our heads in shame as a result of that .
as time went by , we realised the enormity in every sense of what had happened , and the disgraceful way in which the authorities had behaved .
md did it change the way we treated news ?
was this the first time we 'd seen human suffering as close up as this ?
jh i 'm not sure i 'd go as far as that .
there is nothing to compare with the death of a child .
i had covered and have since covered many more disasters - colliery disasters , where miners have died , and of course that is a great tragedy .
but the fact that it was children just transforms it from being a tragedy into something beyond tragedy .
a single death of a single child is a tragedy beyond comprehension for the people involved .
their lives are changed , destroyed .
you ca n't pretend you ever get over the death of a child .
i had a young baby sister who died .
i was too young to realise what was going on but my parents never recovered from it .
the fact there were so many , and i come back to this time and time and time again , the fact it need not have happened - that was the evil , worst tragedy of it .
md how has aberfan changed you and your outlook on life ?
jh i have been a journalist for getting on for half a century now .
i have reported wars and disasters all over the world , many of them involving many , many , many more deaths .
but there has never been anything to compare with aberfan , partly i suppose because i was a relatively young man .
i was in my early 20s and had not been a reporter for long .
if you go off to report a war in a foreign country , you know what you are going to get into and you are prepared for it .
i 'm afraid it 's true that it is different if it 's your own people who have died , and again particularly if it 's young children .
it meant that from an early age i would never see anything as awful as that again .
and although the first hours of that first day were indescribable , what was even worse in one peculiar way was watching them taking the coffins out of the chapel - small coffins .
there 's something unbearably poignant about the size of a child 's coffin .
it just wrenches at you .
whatever has happened to me as a journalist since has not paled into insignificance of course , but i suppose i have been able to put things into context .
i have always said and i will always say that nothing - nothing - i will ever see will compare to the horrors of that day .

i have reported wars and disasters all over the world , many of them involving many , many , many more deaths .
but there has never been anything to compare with aberfan , partly i suppose because i was a relatively young man .
i was in my early 20s and had not been a reporter for long .
if you go off to report a war in a foreign country , you know what you are going to get into and you are prepared for it .
i 'm afraid it 's true that it is different if it 's your own people who have died , and again particularly if it 's young children .
it meant that from an early age i would never see anything as awful as that again .
and although the first hours of that first day were indescribable , what was even worse in one peculiar way was watching them taking the coffins out of the chapel - small coffins .
there 's something unbearably poignant about the size of a child 's coffin .
it just wrenches at you .
whatever has happened to me as a journalist since has not paled into insignificance of course , but i suppose i have been able to put things into context .
i have always said and i will always say that nothing - nothing - i will ever see will compare to the horrors of that day .

the tip slide onto the south wales village left 116 children and 28 adults dead .
humphrys interview he told bbc wales reporter melanie doel how he remembers events unfolding on that day .
md how were you alerted to the story and what was your initial reaction to being sent on such a story ?
jh i was sitting in the newsroom at what used to be called television wales and west -lrb- tww -rrb- .
we got a bit of wire service copy coming in saying there had been a tip slide at merthyr vale and a school had been affected .
to be honest i did n't think much of it because that sort of thing was happening all the time in the welsh valleys .
it was a quiet news morning and i knew the area well so i jumped in the mini and drove up .
there were lots of people women standing on their front door steps sort of looking up the valley - you just got the sense , i felt , and i said so at the time , that something big had happened .
of course i did n't know what it was .
we did n't even know whether anybody had been killed at that stage , but you could feel it .
md when you got there , can you describe the scene that met you ?
jh i did n't recognise aberfan .
i knew merthyr vale and aberfan very well .
i 'd worked in merthyr for years .
i had one of my closest friends living in merthyr vale .
his father worked in the pit and i had stayed in his house many times , which looked over the school .
the tip slide hit the school from behind when i drove down , as far as it was possible to drive into aberfan , i did n't know where i was .
i simply could not reconcile what i was seeing with what i remembered .
there was just this great mass of muck and filth and utter chaos , and it was terribly , terribly difficult to make any sense of it at all .
i think partly one 's brain refuses to recognise what one 's eyes were seeing .
md you got very close to parents in your reporting .
how difficult was it to see them digging for their own children ?
jh you saw the men digging , lots of them stripped to the waist .
the knowledge that they were digging for their own children was indescribably awful .
they 'd rushed up from the coal face obviously the moment they heard what happened .
their faces were still covered in coal dust and there were streaks of white running down their faces - sweat , and tears .
it was ghastly beyond belief .
every so often somebody would shout for silence because they thought they heard the sound of a child crying out .
everybody stopped digging the moment they said that .
there was absolute silence and you all stood there waiting .
mercifully sometimes it was the cry of a child and they were able to dig down .
some children were brought out alive - but too many were n't .
md how difficult was it to remain detached - was there a time you thought , ' i ca n't do this , i just want to help and become part of the rescue ' ?
jh no , i do n't think i ever felt -lsb- that -rsb- .
these men knew what they were doing .
they were skilled miners and it would have been presumptuous and very silly to want to get involved .
but of course one felt a part of it , just as a human being , whether you lived in that community and knew these people or not .
i had lived there and did know them .
i drunk many evenings away in the club at merthyr vale and aberfan .
the miners were the best people to attempt the rescue effort what was important , as the days and months went by , was the world knew what happened and more importantly why it happened , because it did n't need to have happened .
in spite of the lies we were told at the time , warnings had been given .
the men who were looking after that tip knew that there were dangers , and they were not listened to .
that was an utter disgrace - which shamed the whole national coal board then and does to this day .we should all hang our heads in shame as a result of that .
as time went by , we realised the enormity in every sense of what had happened , and the disgraceful way in which the authorities had behaved .
md did it change the way we treated news ?
was this the first time we 'd seen human suffering as close up as this ?
jh i 'm not sure i 'd go as far as that .
there is nothing to compare with the death of a child .
i had covered and have since covered many more disasters - colliery disasters , where miners have died , and of course that is a great tragedy .
but the fact that it was children just transforms it from being a tragedy into something beyond tragedy .
a single death of a single child is a tragedy beyond comprehension for the people involved .
their lives are changed , destroyed .
you ca n't pretend you ever get over the death of a child .
i had a young baby sister who died .
i was too young to realise what was going on but my parents never recovered from it .
the fact there were so many , and i come back to this time and time and time again , the fact it need not have happened - that was the evil , worst tragedy of it .
md how has aberfan changed you and your outlook on life ?
jh i have been a journalist for getting on for half a century now .
i have reported wars and disasters all over the world , many of them involving many , many , many more deaths .

the men who were looking after that tip knew that there were dangers , and they were not listened to .
that was an utter disgrace - which shamed the whole national coal board then and does to this day .we should all hang our heads in shame as a result of that .
as time went by , we realised the enormity in every sense of what had happened , and the disgraceful way in which the authorities had behaved .
md did it change the way we treated news ?
was this the first time we 'd seen human suffering as close up as this ?
jh i 'm not sure i 'd go as far as that .
there is nothing to compare with the death of a child .
i had covered and have since covered many more disasters - colliery disasters , where miners have died , and of course that is a great tragedy .
but the fact that it was children just transforms it from being a tragedy into something beyond tragedy .
a single death of a single child is a tragedy beyond comprehension for the people involved .
their lives are changed , destroyed .
you ca n't pretend you ever get over the death of a child .
i had a young baby sister who died .
i was too young to realise what was going on but my parents never recovered from it .
the fact there were so many , and i come back to this time and time and time again , the fact it need not have happened - that was the evil , worst tragedy of it .
md how has aberfan changed you and your outlook on life ?
jh i have been a journalist for getting on for half a century now .
i have reported wars and disasters all over the world , many of them involving many , many , many more deaths .
but there has never been anything to compare with aberfan , partly i suppose because i was a relatively young man .
i was in my early 20s and had not been a reporter for long .
if you go off to report a war in a foreign country , you know what you are going to get into and you are prepared for it .
i 'm afraid it 's true that it is different if it 's your own people who have died , and again particularly if it 's young children .
it meant that from an early age i would never see anything as awful as that again .
and although the first hours of that first day were indescribable , what was even worse in one peculiar way was watching them taking the coffins out of the chapel - small coffins .
there 's something unbearably poignant about the size of a child 's coffin .
it just wrenches at you .
whatever has happened to me as a journalist since has not paled into insignificance of course , but i suppose i have been able to put things into context .
i have always said and i will always say that nothing - nothing - i will ever see will compare to the horrors of that day .
