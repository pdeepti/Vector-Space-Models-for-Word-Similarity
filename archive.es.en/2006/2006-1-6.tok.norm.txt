here 's how it works . what is vodcasting ?
a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .
download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .

it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .

a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .

a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .

" we decided not to be one of the countries making the joint proposal since we do n't think it 's profitable to submit it again at this moment , " chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe told a news conference . " there is no possibility that they can gain support from two-thirds of the members " of the un general assembly , abe said . " while pursuing consultation with the united states , we are going to continue making an effort to realize reforms , " he added . deja vu the latest proposal is similar to that presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan - the so-called group of four - which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim the countries have proposed to boost the council 's membership from 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats . the proposal ran into opposition from the united states and china , both permanent members of the council along with britain , france and russia . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to participate this time , the three countries co-sponsoring the resolution would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . japan going solo on thursday , japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to the united states , its primary ally , in the aim of securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will japan beat germany in the race to the permanent security council seat ?
" this time we will first seek to gain support from the united states while simultaneously maintaining support from the g4 group of allies , which is still an engine for the security council reform , " said toshihiro kitamura of the japanese foreign ministry . " we hope to file the fresh proposal as soon as possible , in order for the reform of the security council to be realized in the un general assembly in september , " kitamura said . japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . germany 's waning dreams during her forthcoming visit to washington from jan .

it is unlikely , however , that she will be able to get the united states behind the german bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador to the un john bolton the us strongly favors keeping the number of security council permanent members unchanged . earlier this week , the us ambassador to the united nations , john bolton , vowed that in 2006 he will push to reinvigorate a stalled restructuring of the world body by focusing on the creation of a new un human rights panel , which would replace the existing 53-member human rights commission . in an interview with the washington post , published monday , bolton said he would seek assurances that the un security council 's five major powers will be guaranteed posts on a new human rights council , ahead of sensitive diplomatic talks due to resume next week on how to create the new body . " we 'd like to see if we can get the commission abolished and the new council put in place before the existing commission meets again in geneva in a few months , " bolton said . the latest us initiative has been criticized for boosting efforts by china and russia to gain membership in the new rights body , despite their human rights record , as well as for seeking to secure and strengthen the place of the five permanent security council members at the center of un decision making . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "

here 's how it works . what is vodcasting ?
a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .

ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

here 's how it works . what is vodcasting ?
a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .
download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?

" we decided not to be one of the countries making the joint proposal since we do n't think it 's profitable to submit it again at this moment , " chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe told a news conference . " there is no possibility that they can gain support from two-thirds of the members " of the un general assembly , abe said . " while pursuing consultation with the united states , we are going to continue making an effort to realize reforms , " he added . deja vu the latest proposal is similar to that presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan - the so-called group of four - which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim the countries have proposed to boost the council 's membership from 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats . the proposal ran into opposition from the united states and china , both permanent members of the council along with britain , france and russia . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to participate this time , the three countries co-sponsoring the resolution would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . japan going solo on thursday , japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to the united states , its primary ally , in the aim of securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will japan beat germany in the race to the permanent security council seat ?
" this time we will first seek to gain support from the united states while simultaneously maintaining support from the g4 group of allies , which is still an engine for the security council reform , " said toshihiro kitamura of the japanese foreign ministry . " we hope to file the fresh proposal as soon as possible , in order for the reform of the security council to be realized in the un general assembly in september , " kitamura said . japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . germany 's waning dreams during her forthcoming visit to washington from jan .

it is unlikely , however , that she will be able to get the united states behind the german bid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ambassador to the un john bolton the us strongly favors keeping the number of security council permanent members unchanged . earlier this week , the us ambassador to the united nations , john bolton , vowed that in 2006 he will push to reinvigorate a stalled restructuring of the world body by focusing on the creation of a new un human rights panel , which would replace the existing 53-member human rights commission . in an interview with the washington post , published monday , bolton said he would seek assurances that the un security council 's five major powers will be guaranteed posts on a new human rights council , ahead of sensitive diplomatic talks due to resume next week on how to create the new body . " we 'd like to see if we can get the commission abolished and the new council put in place before the existing commission meets again in geneva in a few months , " bolton said . the latest us initiative has been criticized for boosting efforts by china and russia to gain membership in the new rights body , despite their human rights record , as well as for seeking to secure and strengthen the place of the five permanent security council members at the center of un decision making . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .

" we decided not to be one of the countries making the joint proposal since we do n't think it 's profitable to submit it again at this moment , " chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe told a news conference . " there is no possibility that they can gain support from two-thirds of the members " of the un general assembly , abe said . " while pursuing consultation with the united states , we are going to continue making an effort to realize reforms , " he added . deja vu the latest proposal is similar to that presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan - the so-called group of four - which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim the countries have proposed to boost the council 's membership from 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats . the proposal ran into opposition from the united states and china , both permanent members of the council along with britain , france and russia . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to participate this time , the three countries co-sponsoring the resolution would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . japan going solo on thursday , japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to the united states , its primary ally , in the aim of securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will japan beat germany in the race to the permanent security council seat ?
" this time we will first seek to gain support from the united states while simultaneously maintaining support from the g4 group of allies , which is still an engine for the security council reform , " said toshihiro kitamura of the japanese foreign ministry . " we hope to file the fresh proposal as soon as possible , in order for the reform of the security council to be realized in the un general assembly in september , " kitamura said . japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . germany 's waning dreams during her forthcoming visit to washington from jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2006 lufthansa celebrates 80 airborne years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring to new heights german flagship carrier lufthansa , one of the biggest airlines in the world , employing more than 90,000 people and carrying more than 50 million passengers a year to more than 170 destinations , was founded 80 years ago . in the early years of aviation , air travel was a luxury reserved for a select few and the flights themselves entailed a bumpy ride in propeller planes . during world war ii , planes were commandeered for military use and there was very little , if any , civilian air traffic .
when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .
after the crisis year of 2003 , we have managed to be back successfully on the winning track . ” henrik böhme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services .

during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .
after the crisis year of 2003 , we have managed to be back successfully on the winning track . ” henrik böhme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services .

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .
after the crisis year of 2003 , we have managed to be back successfully on the winning track . ” henrik böhme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

here 's how it works . what is vodcasting ?
a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .
download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2006 german minister dismisses nuclear energy option großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will focus on developing renewable energy rather than nuclear power plants germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel came out in favor of renewable energy sources and called for an end of the current debate on whether or not to prolong the lifespan of the country 's nuclear power stations . earlier this week , german chancellor angela merkel had appeared resolved to put the lid on a simmering public debate on whether or not to keep the country 's nuclear power plants in operation for a much longer period than envisaged by the former government under gerhard schröder . merkel said plans to completely phase out nuclear energy in germany over the next two decades would not be revised despite the country 's heavy dependence on russian gas supplies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's environment minister sigmar gabriel but this has n't stopped high-ranking representatives from her own government from insisting that relying on nuclear energy in germany would reduce the risk of one day becoming the target of political blackmail . talking to the media on thursday , environment minister sigmar gabriel was dismissive of suggestions that nuclear power was a viable and secure source of energy in the long term . " in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "
past is past for honecker 's yacht east germany 's last leader may be dead and gone , but his play toys are n't .
erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days .
-lrb- june 27 , 2005 -rrb- pope 's birthplace to fetch fortune the modest bavarian home that was the birthplace of pope benedict xvi is up for grabs , but you 'd have to be seriously wealthy to buy it .
bidders include an oil sheikh , and the price has skyrocketed into the millions .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds .

download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?
all you need is a computer and a connection to the internet to watch deutsche welle 's vodcasts . björn rosenthal -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de podcasting : giving ears to the internet a trend that started in the weblog scene , podcasting gives people a chance to speak their mind and even become a dj .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.

eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .
after the crisis year of 2003 , we have managed to be back successfully on the winning track . ” henrik böhme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services .

" we decided not to be one of the countries making the joint proposal since we do n't think it 's profitable to submit it again at this moment , " chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe told a news conference . " there is no possibility that they can gain support from two-thirds of the members " of the un general assembly , abe said . " while pursuing consultation with the united states , we are going to continue making an effort to realize reforms , " he added . deja vu the latest proposal is similar to that presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan - the so-called group of four - which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim the countries have proposed to boost the council 's membership from 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats . the proposal ran into opposition from the united states and china , both permanent members of the council along with britain , france and russia . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to participate this time , the three countries co-sponsoring the resolution would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . japan going solo on thursday , japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to the united states , its primary ally , in the aim of securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will japan beat germany in the race to the permanent security council seat ?
" this time we will first seek to gain support from the united states while simultaneously maintaining support from the g4 group of allies , which is still an engine for the security council reform , " said toshihiro kitamura of the japanese foreign ministry . " we hope to file the fresh proposal as soon as possible , in order for the reform of the security council to be realized in the un general assembly in september , " kitamura said . japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . germany 's waning dreams during her forthcoming visit to washington from jan .

" we 'd like to see if we can get the commission abolished and the new council put in place before the existing commission meets again in geneva in a few months , " bolton said . the latest us initiative has been criticized for boosting efforts by china and russia to gain membership in the new rights body , despite their human rights record , as well as for seeking to secure and strengthen the place of the five permanent security council members at the center of un decision making . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .
because , at least for next year ’ s world cup , the beautiful game just became the beauty game . zulfikar abbany send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 06.01.2006 opinion : soccer , sex workers and the single male großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ball control will be important for both fans and players alike come the world cup it 's world cup year , if you have n't yet noticed , and thousands of fans will be coming to germany this summer to enjoy the ups and downs of the world 's premier soccer tournament .
some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "
past is past for honecker 's yacht east germany 's last leader may be dead and gone , but his play toys are n't .
erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .
because , at least for next year ’ s world cup , the beautiful game just became the beauty game . zulfikar abbany send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

3 , 2005 -rrb- scoring in the soccer love shack next year 's soccer world cup will be a boon to a host of german businesses , not least , the sex trade .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant .

nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .

the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 06.01.2006 putin eyeing a beach house on the german coast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heiligendamm on the baltic sea is vladimir putin 's dream destination what makes the leader of the largest nation in the world , who could hurl europe back to the ice age at the flip of a switch , dream of the german baltic sea coastline ?
it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .
" we were able to contact target audience member who we would have hardly been able to reach with traditional radio broadcasts . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what 's podcasting ?

a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .
download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?

" we decided not to be one of the countries making the joint proposal since we do n't think it 's profitable to submit it again at this moment , " chief cabinet secretary shinzo abe told a news conference . " there is no possibility that they can gain support from two-thirds of the members " of the un general assembly , abe said . " while pursuing consultation with the united states , we are going to continue making an effort to realize reforms , " he added . deja vu the latest proposal is similar to that presented last year by brazil , germany , india and japan - the so-called group of four - which failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in the un general assembly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's foreign minister celso amorim the countries have proposed to boost the council 's membership from 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats . the proposal ran into opposition from the united states and china , both permanent members of the council along with britain , france and russia . in brazil , foreign minister celso amorim said that , despite japan 's decision not to participate this time , the three countries co-sponsoring the resolution would continue to consult with tokyo on the issue . japan going solo on thursday , japan said it was drawing up its own new un proposal that it hoped would be acceptable to the united states , its primary ally , in the aim of securing a prestigious permanent seat on the security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will japan beat germany in the race to the permanent security council seat ?
" this time we will first seek to gain support from the united states while simultaneously maintaining support from the g4 group of allies , which is still an engine for the security council reform , " said toshihiro kitamura of the japanese foreign ministry . " we hope to file the fresh proposal as soon as possible , in order for the reform of the security council to be realized in the un general assembly in september , " kitamura said . japan , the un 's number-two contributor after the united states , renewed its complaints last month that it pays too much to the world body , after secretary general kofi annan said tokyo should not slash its contribution despite losing its bid for a permanent council seat . germany 's waning dreams during her forthcoming visit to washington from jan .

" we 'd like to see if we can get the commission abolished and the new council put in place before the existing commission meets again in geneva in a few months , " bolton said . the latest us initiative has been criticized for boosting efforts by china and russia to gain membership in the new rights body , despite their human rights record , as well as for seeking to secure and strengthen the place of the five permanent security council members at the center of un decision making . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g4 knocks on security council doors again along with japan , brazil and india , german foreign minister fischer on thursday renewed calls for permanent security council membership , on the sidelines of the un world summit in new york .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "
" dunno .
hope gerd will be around , though .
he sure knew how to party . " toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de best of from the fringe 2005 click here for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's series " from the fringe . "
past is past for honecker 's yacht east germany 's last leader may be dead and gone , but his play toys are n't .
erich honecker 's erstwhile state yacht may soon be sailing the seas with a very different load of passengers than in its communist glory days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2006 lufthansa celebrates 80 airborne years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soaring to new heights german flagship carrier lufthansa , one of the biggest airlines in the world , employing more than 90,000 people and carrying more than 50 million passengers a year to more than 170 destinations , was founded 80 years ago . in the early years of aviation , air travel was a luxury reserved for a select few and the flights themselves entailed a bumpy ride in propeller planes . during world war ii , planes were commandeered for military use and there was very little , if any , civilian air traffic .
when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .

when world war ii ended in 1945 , lufthansa service was halted entirely and the airline liquidated . however , ten years later , on april 1 , 1955 , lufthansa re-emerged as the german national carrier and re-launched regular flight schedules . early that morning , shortly after eight , a silver lufthansa convair 340 took off from munich heading to hamburg via frankfurt and cologne .
the 17 passengers on board paid 317 deutschmarks for a ticket and the historic flight lasted four hours and 20 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the service however was as charming as ever back then at the stops in between , there were elaborate ceremonies and radio reports .
" right now , the twin-engine convair is taxiing to the terminal in frankfurt .
numerous guests have gathered here to celebrate this historic and memorable occasion , ” is how one report went . rebirth of a storied airline this was the re-birth of an airline after the defeat of nazi germany , thanks to a special permit issued by her majesty the queen of england .
civilian passenger traffic was already underway in germany after the war , but the carriers until 1955 were air france , sas or klm . but now , it was lufthansa ’ s turn .
the beginnings were modest and the airline ’ s early advertisements catered mostly to businessmen and the well-heeled . " instead of excessive luxury , you ’ ll enjoy an atmosphere of elegant coziness with every conceivable comfort - from air conditioning and pressurized cabins to the marvelous rubber foam , adjustable seats . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photo from 1926 shows one of the first lufthansa carriers lufthansa was originally founded on january 6 , 1926 , when german carrier aero lloyd and junkers merged .
the company grew rapidly , notching up its one-millionth passenger in 1934 .
the airline started services to new york and tokyo , but was essentially turned over to the german air force , the luftwaffe , during the second world war . when the airline began passenger service again in 1955 , it had to borrow planes that would never survive today ’ s safety standards , recalls werner bittner , one of lufthansa ’ s first pilots after the war . " i was flying dc-3s that we bought from the french .
we didn ’ t know they ’ d been used in indochina .
they had bullet holes that had been patched , ” werner said . steep growth curve but after the war , it didn ’ t take long for a new era to take hold .
on march 2 , 1960 , the first boeing 707 jet landed in hamburg . and ten years after that , the 747 , the jumbo conquered the skies .
its first landing in germany was in frankfurt , and the plane ’ s captain , josef förster , remembers how the crowds went wild . “ we really didn ’ t know what was going on until we landed .
even the police couldn ’ t hold back the crowd which began running across the airfield to the hangar where we were .
nothing could be done . ” until the 1990s , lufthansa was a state-owned enterprise that was losing money until its initial public offering in 1997 . like most other airlines , lufthansa , too , slid into crisis after the september 11 terrorist attacks in new york and the sars epidemic in asia which sharply curtailed air travel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa has bounced back after the crisis year but a strict cost-saving course brought the company back into the black , says wolfgang mayrhuber , the new lufthansa chairman . “ lufthansa has grown and become more attractive .
after the crisis year of 2003 , we have managed to be back successfully on the winning track . ” henrik böhme -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lufthansa takes on low-cost airlines in the battle for domination in the german skies , lufthansa is seeking to beat low-cost rivals at their own game by expanding its own network of cut-price domestic and european services .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .

a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "
" is angie coming ? "

here 's how it works . what is vodcasting ?
a step beyond podcasting , vodcasting , also called video podcasting or vlogging , adds video to the downloadable sound files podcast listeners are used to .
download the video files is a simple matter of subscribing to a vodcast in one of the many freely available directory programs . after downloading and saving them to a portable video player , users can choose when and where they want to watch the video , making them independent of television programming schedules .
a number of vodcasting tools also exist to help turn people from mere video consumers to producers . apple added vodcasting support to its popular itunes software , which lets users subscribe to pod and vodcasts and automatically downloads the most recent updates .
ipodder , another popular service that started with podcasts , also has a vodcast directory . vodcasts ' large file size makes a flat rate , broadband internet connection a necessity to speed up downloads and keeps costs down .
watching the video away from the computer also requires a mobile video player , which are often built into newer pdas and many mp3 players , including the ipod video . how does vodcasting work ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vodcasts are listed in the itunes directory the rss feeds , short for really simple syndication , bloggers started using in 2001 to send their entries directly to readers ' inboxes are just as useful when it comes to receiving vodcasts .
an enclosure feature , standard to rss feeds , allows links to videos that can be processed by programs like itunes and ipodder , which then download the vodcasts automatically , and leaves subscribers only with the work of finding vodcasts that catch their interest . how can i see the deutsche welle 's vodcasts ?

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .

it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .

the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.

warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .

during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .

it is an affair of the heart . russian president vladimir putin is planning to buy a luxury villa on germany 's baltic coast , german tabloid bild reported on friday . putin , 53 , has begun negotiations with the cologne-based investment group findus , which owns the villa in the exclusive resort of heiligendamm , the newspaper said . the villa is said to have hosted the family of the russian czar around the turn of the 19th century , and putin is expected to refurbish it in grand style with marble , rare wood and silk carpets . but why ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " excuse me , mr. putin .
i 'll be out of your way in second . "
heiligendamm is the oldest beach resort in germany .
it was founded in 1793 by great duke friedrich franz i von mecklenburg .
it prides itself on its classicist architecture and blandish nickname " white town by the sea . "
european aristocrats , known for their peculiar tastes , were frequent visitors until the 1930s . but - let 's be frank about it - heiligendamm is not exactly a tropical paradise .
madonna did not shoot the video for " la isla bonita " in germany , and for good reason . women in heiligendamm are not wearing gorgeous flamenco dresses , and men are not even remotely close to being swarthy guitar players with bushy eyebrows and a vaguely mysterious look in their eyes .
on an average baltic sea vacation , you are more likely to suffer from hypothermia than a sun stroke .
the local specialty is mecklenburger speckkartoffelsalat -lrb- potato salad mixed with chopped bacon -rrb- , and not - contrary to popular belief - piña colada . so , if you are the president of a country that temporarily switched off its gas supplies to an entire continent - for the same reason that the dog licks itself , because it can - why would you bother ?
what is putin seeing in germany 's short and brisk summers that we , mere mortals , are not ? high class entertainment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a big bear hug for my best buddy !
bild quoted diplomatic sources as saying the russian head of state wanted to buy the three-storey house because germany is hosting the g8 summit - annual meeting of the richest nations in the world - in may 2007 in heiligendamm . while other dignitaries will have to graciously accept accommodation at the kempinski grand , one of germany 's most luxurious hotels , putin will get a chance to show off in front of the other big shots by throwing chill-out parties at his own beach mansion . but it 's probably more than that .
it is no secret that president putin and former chancellor schröder are best buddies .
when it became more or less obvious that schröder 's days as chancellor were numbered , putin gave schröder a small cheer-me-up gift in the form of a russian-german pipeline deal worth 5.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- and a job on the gas consortium for his post-chancellor days of leisure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin wants to throw the best g8 summit party ever now , that 's friendship : taking care of your buddy , when he needs it the most .
german politics , in fact , has probably not seen that level of cross-cultural intimacy since soviet president brezhnev kissed east german president erich honecker on the mouth . so can we blame president putin for wanting to be closer to his best friend ?
of course not . we can only look forward to the reports from the g8 summit in 2007 . " hey , tony , what 's up ? "
" nada , jacques .
gotta go to volodya 's beach house . "

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

her 47-year-old husband dragomir , who was wanted by a court in the bosnian capital sarajevo over alleged atrocities committed in rogatica during the balkan state 's 1992-1995 war , and 12-year-old son also suffered gunshot wounds . " rada abazovic , 46 , died from a loss of blood after being shot in the stomach " after being taken to the foca hospital , maric told afp .
" the boy was operated -lrb- on -rrb- and his life is not in danger .
his father sustained serious head wounds and his condition is still not stable , " said maric .
the gun battle took place at about 9:30 a.m.
-lrb- 0830 uct -rrb- when the eu peacekeepers returned fire after being shot at from the fugitive 's house .
warrant for arrest the forces of the european union in bosnia , or eufor , confirmed there was a shooting incident in the vicinity of rogatica , about 60 kilometers -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- , east of sarajevo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : locals gathered nearby after the incident " eufor troops were fired upon and they returned fire .
during the exchange two people in the house were injured .
the suspect , unable to escape , subsequently injured himself , " said eufor spokesman jem thomas .
eufor said in a statement that the operation was carried out in accordance with a warrant issued in 1999 by the sarajevo cantonal court for abazovic 's arrest . a top leader from bosnia 's serb entity criticized the raid as an unnecessary show of aggression and demanded that eufor 's commander conduct an open investigation into the incident and that those responsible be punished . " it acts as a serious incident which harms the reputation of eufor and which destroys confidence in this kind of military force , " said bosnian serb president dragan cavic .
" i am convinced that this action by eufor is a brutal show of force violating conventions on human rights , " said cavic .
casualties in past raids the more than 6,000 eufor troops provide a deterrence and continued compliance with provisions of the us-brokered dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war .
last year eufor took over from nato-led peacekeeping forces that were deployed in the former yugoslav republic after the war . in april 2004 the brother of serb war crimes suspect , milan lukic , was killed when local police raided his house .
the same month a serbian orthodox priest and his 28-year-old son were seriously injured during a nato swoop on their home in an attempt to capture top bosnian serb war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic . karadzic and his wartime military chief ratko mladic remain at large more than a decade after the un war crimes court issued indictments against them for their part in the siege of sarajevo and the srebrenica massacre . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ex-minister next un high representative for bosnia germany 's former postal service minister , christian schwarz-schilling , is to succeed britain 's paddy ashdown as the international community 's high representative in bosnia , officials announced wednesday .

" in no other energy sector is our dependence on imports as big as in the nuclear field .
we 're actually talking about a 100 percent dependence , as far as uranium imports are concerned , " gabriel said . watch that basket " in addition , world-wide uranium deposits will last only for another 20 years in the worst case , according to oecd estimates .
there 's a maximum reserve of no more than 4 million tonnes of uranium available at present , so it makes no sense to put too many eggs in this particular basket , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government is resolute on closing down the country 's nuclear power plants " no one wanting to draw up sensible energy policy could imagine investing billions of euros in an energy source that will be exhausted within a generation , " gabriel said . utz claassen , managing director of a major german energy supplier from baden-würtemberg , fears that the closing down of nuclear power plants will shift the focus too much on to more coal-driven plants , which , he argues , would be detrimental to the environment . " if we are serious about reducing carbon dioxide emissions for a healthier planet and keep energy prices under control , we ca n't really do without nuclear energy in the decades ahead , " claasen said . nuclear energy as a safety measure ? several european nations are considering the merits of nuclear power at the moment .
finland has begun work on a new nuclear plant , the first to be built on the continent in a decade , and france 's parliament also recently gave its approval for a new nuclear plant . " a modification of the -lrb- german -rrb- government 's current phase-out plan with a view to prolonging the lifespan of some of our nuclear power plants would certainly make sense in the face of the recent turbulence on the energy market , " claasen said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is the energy of the future environment minister gabriel points out , though , that playing off nuclear against coal energy does n't make sense at all .
nuclear power plants , he argues , do not produce any heating energy for households and industry , whereas gas and coal-powered stations do . according to the environment minister , it 's vital for germany to ensure a sensible mix of energy resources to be used with a greater percentage of renewable sources in future . " what 's clear to me is that a total independence from energy imports will remain an illusion , " gabriel said . " but we can certainly reduce our dependence by investing more in renewable energy .
it 'll also important to sign long-term supply contracts with a number of our partners abroad , " he said . renewable energy is the answer gabriel sees no danger in continuing the country 's large-scale cooperation with russia , as far as gas and oil supplies are concerned . # b # he speaks of the need to ensure long-term delivery contracts and mentions that a greater shift towards suppliers from the arab world would n't mean more planning security either .
the scarcity of resources world-wide , he argues , should prompt germans to be more aware of the need to save more energy . according to mcilvaine co . - a us based energy consulting company - the world renewable energy market will nearly double in sales from 2005 to 2008 .
germany has the world 's largest installed base for generating energy from wind and , after japan , the largest solar energy grid . gabriel confirmed that chancellor angela merkel will shortly be holding a summit of industry leaders and government representatives to discuss the country 's energy-political strategy in the decades ahead . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : fueling europe with russian gas the " gas war " between russia and ukraine has fueled a heated debate in germany about the country 's energy policy , but chancellor angela merkel reaffirmed her government 's commitment to the nuclear phase-out .

some may even watch some games too . soccer - as we ’ re all repeatedly told - is the beautiful game .
and a simple one at that .
you ’ ve got two teams , usually , with eleven ugly men either side .
they spend 90 minutes or so , kicking a ball around .
and , in the end , germany always wins .
or so the saying goes .
a simple game made for men . so what has heidi klum got to do with it all ?
the german supermodel is a woman , right ? !
well , it turns out that next year ’ s world cup is all about women .
it ’ s a simple matter of business . ms klum is just about germany ’ s best export .
she ‘ s the classic teutonic bride .
she ’ s bigger than cars , and better than sex .
small wonder , given that she was once heard suggesting , in a coquettish voice , at a photo shoot that “ these panties should be smaller , don ’ t you think ? ”
yes , dear .
so , you get ms klum reeling in the punters to an event that could either be a further financial defeat for germany or its remaking . it stands to reason then that ms klum was invited to leipzig to co-host the draw of the world cup ’ s first matches .
her dress was a mess , but ms klum was definitely all there - all star and all woman .
women being a commodity in short supply these days . yes , that ’ s right : short supply .
but there ’ s no need to fear .
back-up is on the way .
in fact , germany expects to be awash with sex workers from eastern europe .
the cheek of it , i hear you say , economic migrants trying to cash in on one hell of a cash cow . sex expected to be big business at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like ronaldinho , you too can look forward to scoring at the world cup well , get used to it .
it ’ s estimated there ’ ll be an extra 40,000 sex workers at hand come june 2006 , when the games get underway .
add that number to the 400,000 sex workers already in germany , and then divide that by the number of football fans expected - subtracting , of course , women and children first - and you get ... another number .
well , you get the picture . that ’ s a lot of business .
and it ’ s got women ’ s groups at each other ’ s throats .
in berlin , an advice center for sex workers is estimating a massive turnover .
while another organization , the national council for women , is calling on soccer players to act as role models to discourage other men from the practice .
it ’ s now goalkeeper oliver kahn ’ s job to explain that real men don ’ t support the sex trade . real men obviously being the sort to drool over supermodels like heidi klum , while her husband , the musician , seal , wails from the terraces at the opening ceremony , no doubt . enough to go round ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : form an orderly queue , boys but there ’ s a far more worrying statistic .
the organizers of the world cup are saying it will create 50,000 jobs for germany ’ s jobless youth .
and i ’ m wondering whether they ’ ve got their sums right .
i mean , deduct the 40,000 expected sex worker start-ups from the 50,000 new jobs , and that only leaves 10,000 to go around .
looks like there ’ ll be some very unhappy young men who ’ ll need to be appeased with the promise of sexual favors . on that score germany should come good .
because , at least for next year ’ s world cup , the beautiful game just became the beauty game . zulfikar abbany send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns over projected influx of prostitutes for world cup germany is braced for an influx of not only three million football fans to next year 's world cup but also thousands of illegal sex workers from eastern europe .

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

some call it the radio of the future and an alternative to today 's broadcasting . it 's been awhile since weblogs made it simple for anyone to become a world wide web publisher using easy-to-update online journals .
now with podcasting , it 's nearly as easy to become a radio broadcaster as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apple 's ipod nano portable music player a combination of the words " broadcast " and " ipod , " apple 's famous portable music player , podcasts are downloadable audio files , usually in mp3 format , that can be saved and heard whenever listeners choose . personalized radio interest in podcasting has grown as mp3 players become more and more common , allowing listeners to put together their own mix of podcasts covering nearly every topic , including religiously themed " godcasts , " the food lovers ' " gastrocast " cooking shows and " educasts " that help listeners learn everything from foreign languages to physics .
an array of news and music podcasts also keeps listeners well-informed and foot-tapping . listening to podcasts has several advantages over both weblogs and traditional radio .
unlike weblogs , also called blogs , that require readers be connected to the internet , podcast users do n't need to be online after downloading the audio file , making them independent of radio schedules that dictate when a program can be heard . a number of programs , including ipodder and apple 's itunes , make it easy for users to find and subscribe to podcasts and automatically download the most recent ones to their computer , and portable music player if they wish .
due to the podcasts ' large file sizes , usually between 30 and 60 megabytes , a flat rate , broadband internet connection is recommend to speed up downloads and keep down costs . amateurs rival professional quality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whether podcasting replaces radio remains to be seen but not everything can be put into a podcast .
intellectual property rights keep commercial products , like most pop music and books on tape , from being included in podcasts , which are normally a free and made under creative commons licenses that allowing others to do what they please with the content for non-commercial purposes . though there are some professionally produced podcasts , commercial radio has yet to make many large forays into downloadable programs , most podcasts are still created by amateurs whose quality often rivals that of traditional radio . reaching new listeners some bloggers and internet observers expect podcasting to be the radio of the future .
the ability to rewind , fast forward and listen to a program outside a station 's limited reception area make podcasts a way for today 's radio broadcasters to find more listeners .
whether they decide to embrace podcasting on a large scale , however , remains to be seen . " the positive response surprised me , " said wolfgang harrer , a journalist and weblog author who worked on a podcast during the 2004 us presidential election for dw-world and german public broadcaster zdf .

glitter was convicted of possessing child porn in britain in 1999 and served half of a four-month jail sentence .
he later went to cambodia , which permanently expelled him in 2002 .

the sailor is being held in us custody near where the incident took place , in yokosuka - where the uss kitty hawk aircraft carrier is based .
yoshie sato died on tuesday , after being found beaten and unconscious .
her death comes at a time when the us is trying to win local support to station a new nuclear-powered aircraft carrier at yokosuka .
analysts say this recent incident could complicate sensitive negotiations between washington and tokyo over the redeployment of us forces in japan .
incidents involving us troops and local japanese are particularly sensitive because of a 1995 case when three us servicemen raped a schoolgirl .
reported confession police believe yoshie sato was attacked during a robbery , according to local news reports .
the sailor , who has not been identified , is being held pending an investigation into the killing , the us navy said in a statement on friday .
japanese media reported on thursday that the sailor had already confessed to the killing , but commander john wallach , director of public affairs for the us naval forces in japan , told reuters news agency he could not confirm or deny those reports .
the us navy statement said it had ordered a " period of reflection " for all its personnel , imposing a temporary curfew requiring them to be back on base by midnight .
" the entire navy community in japan is deeply saddened by this incident , " the statement said .
rear admiral james kelly , commander of the us naval forces in japan , offered his " deep regret and sadness " over the death .
the us statement said the navy was co-operating closely with the japanese authorities , but it remains unclear whether the sailor will be handed over to japanese custody .
a us-japan pact governing the conduct of military personnel in japan does not require such a transfer until suspects are charged .
but after the 1995 rape of a japanese schoolgirl by three us servicemen on the island of okinawa , washington agreed to seriously consider handing over suspects accused of serious crimes .
about 50,000 us troops are stationed in japan under a joint security pact , but tokyo and washington agreed late last year to remove 7,000 marines and shift other remaining troops within japan .
