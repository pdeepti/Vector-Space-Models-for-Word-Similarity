the economy seems to be picking up , while the morose german landscape has been transformed into what the german magazine der spiegel has called a " land of smiles .

more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .

it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .

the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .

" taking the decision first and consulting after is not our idea of solidarity , " defense minister radek sikorski said on sunday during a round table discussion on energy in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish defense minister radek sikorski " germany is an important partner for us .
we are astonished that germany would do something which does n't benefit the consumers and whose geopolitical objective is to be able to cut off belarus and poland without cutting off germany , " he said . " poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head .
that was the locarno tradition , that was the molotov-ribbentrop tradition .
that was the 20th century .
we do n't want any repetition of that , " sikorski said in a reference to hitler 's nonaggression pact with stalin in 1939 which allowed poland to be carved up between the nazis and the soviet union . in early march poland 's conservative president lech kaczynski had already criticized plans for the pipeline saying it was " in flagrant contradiction with polish interests " russian state-controlled energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and e.on agreed in september to build the 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 740-mile -rrb- natural gas pipeline . the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania have also been up in arms over the project .
poland and its baltic neighbors say the pipeline not only deprives them of transit fees , but poses environmental risks and undermines their energy security .
the former soviet union dumped tons of chemical weapons in the baltic sea following world war ii , and construction of the underwater pipeline could disturb them , these countries have said . a heat war ? poland is not the only european country which sees the russian energy supplier as a political and economic hot potato .
tensions between russia and the european union burst into the open last week over gazprom 's hard-headed ambitions to control everything from supply to distribution of european gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's expansion has the blessings of russian president vladimir putin gazprom has a swagger in its giant step and is making some in europe nervous with its sheer size , its control of vast gas reserves and declared intention of getting into the retail end of the industry on european soil . already , the european union gets 26 percent of its natural gas from gazprom and russian president vladimir putin has a blunt response to any eu jitters . " we constantly hear about some threat of dependence on russia and that russian companies should have limited access to the energy market , " he said in the siberian city of tomsk thursday after meeting german chancellor angela merkel .
" what are we to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start to look for other markets . " when gazprom talks , the energy-hungry west listens . a russian giant the company 's market capitalization leapt wednesday to $ 266 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- , making it second only to the us exxonmobil among world energy companies . the semi-public company controls 60 percent of russia 's immense natural gas reserves and has monopoly control over the country 's gas pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gazprom headquaters in moscow now gazprom , whose policies and managers are closely linked to the kremlin , is looking to eat up more than a dozen european assets such as centrica , which distributes gas across half the british market , deputy chairman alexander medvedev said last tuesday . putin this week blasted what he said were moves being considered in britain to block a gazprom acquisition of centrica " under the slightest pretext . " " when people come to us , it is investment and globalization , but if we plan to go somewhere , then it is already the expansion of russian companies . " no reciprocity according to adam landes , oil and gas analyst for renaissance capital , however , gazprom is far from the innocent party it claims to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- russian-german pipeline is scheduled to beging operating in 2010 " there is no reciprocity , gazprom is criticizing europe for not opening its markets but russia is completely shut , " he said .
" gazprom responds ruthlessly to threats ... it always behaved like that . " austrian economy minister martin bartenstein warned that an eu-gazprom conflict would " have no benefit . "
british prime minister tony blair 's government has also indicated that gazprom is free to shop for centrica . but the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a stillborn pact medvedev told participants at an economic forum in london last week that the energy pact between russia and the eu was " stillborn .

" we are not going to stand by and watch the government take apart the public health system piece by piece , " franz bsirske , the president of the public service trade union verdi , told a protest in berlin . the head of the powerful metal workers ' union ig metall , jürgen peters , said in the southern city of munich that trade unions should stand firm against any attempt to implement " social reforms that take us backwards . "
" we already have five million unemployed people .
and those who have jobs are made to work longer so that those who do n't have even less of a chance of finding work , " he said . bsirske and peters were referring to plans to reform the public health system and to raise the national retirement age to 67 years , up from 63 for women and 65 for men . merkel 's government of christian democrats and social democrats was due to discuss health and tax reforms on monday and to hold talks later in the month on prolonging the traditional trial period of six months for young employees to two years . " france 's problems are germany 's " the president of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , lashed out against the youth contract reform at a rally in wolfsburg , the central city that is home to the headquarters of car maker volkswagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer compared germany to france " the government should not put in place anti-social policies , " sommer said .
evoking the recent outcry in france over a youth jobs law which would have made it easier for companies to hire and fire people under 26 , he added : " what is wrong in france is also wrong in germany . " sommer said the dgb , the umbrella body for german trade unions , was launching a campaign to defend the dignity of workers and lashed out at employers " whose main objective is their own bank accounts and not the dignity of their workers . " demonstrators ' numbers overwhelm neo-nazis in leipzig , neo-nazis and thousands of left-wing protestors pelted each other with stones and bottles , police said .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .

" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .

only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .

24 , 2006 -rrb- german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge .

27 , 2006 -rrb- german strikes drag on , french protests escalate " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .

" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .

only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 01.05.2006 world-shaping angies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paparazzi love her : chancellor merkel , color-coordinated with her husband a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .
the barman looks at them and asks : " what is this ?
unsexiest people alive ? "
" no , " they respond .
" we rock the world . " sex appeal may be seriously overrated , after all . take german chancellor angela merkel , for example . what does a frowny-faced physicist who grew up in the communist east have in common with us actress , sex bomb , video game impersonator and general goody-goody angelina jolie - other than the similar first name ?
is it those soft , kissable , honey-colored lips of pure delicious lush ?
or is it , perhaps , the sizzling hot passion for the eternally tanned bundle of metrosexual appeal , a.k.a.
brad pitt ?
or is it the fact that paparazzi all over the world are desperately offering their children for sale in exchange for a compromising shot of one of the two angies , in or out of the bathing suit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other angie : actress and un goodwill ambassador jolie none of the above .
both angies , however , along with luminaries ranging from legally blond reese witherspoon to almost illegally ineloquent george w. bush , have made the latest list of 100 people who - for better or worse - shaped our world in 2005 , according to us time magazine . a strange world a world which is shaped , at the same time , albeit in different categories , by cocky standup comedian ellen degeneres and iran 's whacko president and nuclear power buff mahmoud ahmadinejad , is a strange , dislocated kind of the world in which the borders between politics , big business and entertainment are often blurred for the sake of generating media excitement as a kind of postmodern gesamtkunstwerk . which is exactly why it is so remarkable that german chancellor angela merkel - whose all work and no play attitude makes her a perfect , if less entertaining , antipode to her cigar-smoking predecessor gerhard schröder - is rising to such celebrity status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they move in high circles : merkel and pope benedict xvi mekel still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
in one comedy show , she is portrayed by a bearded actor wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , while being dubbed by a radio anchor famous for imitating both the eerie monotony and the subtle fluctuations of merkel 's high-pitched , guttural voice . yet this " dull " and " unexciting " politician is enjoying unprecedented approval ratings .
the economy seems to be picking up , while the morose german landscape has been transformed into what the german magazine der spiegel has called a " land of smiles . " unsexy , but influential the latest list of those who make the world go around confirms the clichéd view of germany as a nation of serious , unsexy people .
german top models heidi klum , claudia schiffer and nadia auermann are nowhere on the list .
neither are young german soccer jocks michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
this should make germans proud , because their country can also offer brains , not just brawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend franz beckenbauer the other germans who made it big on the international scene , according to time , are prada wearing pope benedict xvi , 79 ; german soccer legend and president of the organizing committee of the world cup franz beckenbauer , 60 ; and - the young gun , so to speak - daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche , soon to turn 54 . influence on the world stage is , of course , a nebulous concept .
you can not measure it in either absolute or relative terms , and lists like these are ultimately exercises in often unfathomable editorial policies . angie rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche - making the walrus moustache fashionable again ?
and while in terms of their looks , benedict xvi , beckenbauer and zetsche can hardly measure up to george clooney - their fellow world-shaping giant , according to time - germans , in general , seem to be doing better and better in the eyes of the world . when the white smoke coming out of the most watched chimney in the entire world indicated that german cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope last spring , germany collectively fell into papal hysteria .
" we are the pope , " read a headline in one of germany 's most widely circulated tabloids . now , with their first female chancellor listed as one of the big movers and shakers , the new - slightly exaggerated - headline could read : " angie rules the world . " who would have thought ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click hear for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe . "
no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .
-lrb- july 27 , 2005 -rrb- of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .
now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride .

the economy seems to be picking up , while the morose german landscape has been transformed into what the german magazine der spiegel has called a " land of smiles . " unsexy , but influential the latest list of those who make the world go around confirms the clichéd view of germany as a nation of serious , unsexy people .
german top models heidi klum , claudia schiffer and nadia auermann are nowhere on the list .
neither are young german soccer jocks michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
this should make germans proud , because their country can also offer brains , not just brawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend franz beckenbauer the other germans who made it big on the international scene , according to time , are prada wearing pope benedict xvi , 79 ; german soccer legend and president of the organizing committee of the world cup franz beckenbauer , 60 ; and - the young gun , so to speak - daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche , soon to turn 54 . influence on the world stage is , of course , a nebulous concept .
you can not measure it in either absolute or relative terms , and lists like these are ultimately exercises in often unfathomable editorial policies . angie rules bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dieter zetsche - making the walrus moustache fashionable again ?
and while in terms of their looks , benedict xvi , beckenbauer and zetsche can hardly measure up to george clooney - their fellow world-shaping giant , according to time - germans , in general , seem to be doing better and better in the eyes of the world . when the white smoke coming out of the most watched chimney in the entire world indicated that german cardinal joseph ratzinger was elected pope last spring , germany collectively fell into papal hysteria .
" we are the pope , " read a headline in one of germany 's most widely circulated tabloids . now , with their first female chancellor listed as one of the big movers and shakers , the new - slightly exaggerated - headline could read : " angie rules the world . " who would have thought ? toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click hear for a selection of quirkiest stories from dw-world 's " from the fringe .

no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .

now , even the pope has been dragged into the post-election fun ride .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .
-lrb- apr .
24 , 2006 -rrb- german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge .
-lrb- apr .
27 , 2006 -rrb- german strikes drag on , french protests escalate " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .
-lrb- apr .
24 , 2006 -rrb- german economy gathers steam , institutes revise forecast german economic performance is predicted to grow by 1.8 percent in 2006 , the highest rate in six years , the country 's six leading economic institutes said .
but a wave of new jobs is not expected to accompany the upsurge .
-lrb- apr .
27 , 2006 -rrb- german strikes drag on , french protests escalate " not again ! " is a common response to protests in france , but a number of groups across the rhine are proving they know how to stage a strike , too .
they just do n't need to do it as often , experts say .

" we are not going to stand by and watch the government take apart the public health system piece by piece , " franz bsirske , the president of the public service trade union verdi , told a protest in berlin . the head of the powerful metal workers ' union ig metall , jürgen peters , said in the southern city of munich that trade unions should stand firm against any attempt to implement " social reforms that take us backwards . "
" we already have five million unemployed people .
and those who have jobs are made to work longer so that those who do n't have even less of a chance of finding work , " he said . bsirske and peters were referring to plans to reform the public health system and to raise the national retirement age to 67 years , up from 63 for women and 65 for men . merkel 's government of christian democrats and social democrats was due to discuss health and tax reforms on monday and to hold talks later in the month on prolonging the traditional trial period of six months for young employees to two years . " france 's problems are germany 's " the president of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , lashed out against the youth contract reform at a rally in wolfsburg , the central city that is home to the headquarters of car maker volkswagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer compared germany to france " the government should not put in place anti-social policies , " sommer said .
evoking the recent outcry in france over a youth jobs law which would have made it easier for companies to hire and fire people under 26 , he added : " what is wrong in france is also wrong in germany . " sommer said the dgb , the umbrella body for german trade unions , was launching a campaign to defend the dignity of workers and lashed out at employers " whose main objective is their own bank accounts and not the dignity of their workers . " demonstrators ' numbers overwhelm neo-nazis in leipzig , neo-nazis and thousands of left-wing protestors pelted each other with stones and bottles , police said .
the violence broke out as some 5,000 people tried to stop protest marches by about 550 neo-nazis in leipzig by blocking the streets with burning trash cans , the police said .
some 2,000 policemen who had been brought in from around the country eventually separated the two groups , arresting 20 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no sex with neo-nazis " read the demonstrators ' banner in the northeastern city of rostock some 500 members of germany 's extreme right national democratic party clashed with about 4,000 counter protestors , the police said , adding that they arrested 40 people there . in germany neo-nazi demonstrations often provoke much larger counter protests and end in clashes with the police , particularly on may day . quiet in berlin , so far in berlin 's kreuzberg district , which is home to a large turkish community , several hundred people marched through the streets in support of kurdish and maoist organizations on monday .
police said they were expecting left-wing groups to launch protests in kreuzberg later in the day . the area is known for unrest during walpurgis night , may day 's eve celebrations , which have their roots in a pagan spring rite .

" taking the decision first and consulting after is not our idea of solidarity , " defense minister radek sikorski said on sunday during a round table discussion on energy in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish defense minister radek sikorski " germany is an important partner for us .
we are astonished that germany would do something which does n't benefit the consumers and whose geopolitical objective is to be able to cut off belarus and poland without cutting off germany , " he said . " poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head .
that was the locarno tradition , that was the molotov-ribbentrop tradition .
that was the 20th century .
we do n't want any repetition of that , " sikorski said in a reference to hitler 's nonaggression pact with stalin in 1939 which allowed poland to be carved up between the nazis and the soviet union . in early march poland 's conservative president lech kaczynski had already criticized plans for the pipeline saying it was " in flagrant contradiction with polish interests " russian state-controlled energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and e.on agreed in september to build the 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 740-mile -rrb- natural gas pipeline . the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania have also been up in arms over the project .
poland and its baltic neighbors say the pipeline not only deprives them of transit fees , but poses environmental risks and undermines their energy security .
the former soviet union dumped tons of chemical weapons in the baltic sea following world war ii , and construction of the underwater pipeline could disturb them , these countries have said . a heat war ? poland is not the only european country which sees the russian energy supplier as a political and economic hot potato .
tensions between russia and the european union burst into the open last week over gazprom 's hard-headed ambitions to control everything from supply to distribution of european gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's expansion has the blessings of russian president vladimir putin gazprom has a swagger in its giant step and is making some in europe nervous with its sheer size , its control of vast gas reserves and declared intention of getting into the retail end of the industry on european soil . already , the european union gets 26 percent of its natural gas from gazprom and russian president vladimir putin has a blunt response to any eu jitters . " we constantly hear about some threat of dependence on russia and that russian companies should have limited access to the energy market , " he said in the siberian city of tomsk thursday after meeting german chancellor angela merkel .
" what are we to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start to look for other markets . " when gazprom talks , the energy-hungry west listens . a russian giant the company 's market capitalization leapt wednesday to $ 266 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- , making it second only to the us exxonmobil among world energy companies . the semi-public company controls 60 percent of russia 's immense natural gas reserves and has monopoly control over the country 's gas pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gazprom headquaters in moscow now gazprom , whose policies and managers are closely linked to the kremlin , is looking to eat up more than a dozen european assets such as centrica , which distributes gas across half the british market , deputy chairman alexander medvedev said last tuesday . putin this week blasted what he said were moves being considered in britain to block a gazprom acquisition of centrica " under the slightest pretext . " " when people come to us , it is investment and globalization , but if we plan to go somewhere , then it is already the expansion of russian companies . " no reciprocity according to adam landes , oil and gas analyst for renaissance capital , however , gazprom is far from the innocent party it claims to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- russian-german pipeline is scheduled to beging operating in 2010 " there is no reciprocity , gazprom is criticizing europe for not opening its markets but russia is completely shut , " he said .
" gazprom responds ruthlessly to threats ... it always behaved like that . " austrian economy minister martin bartenstein warned that an eu-gazprom conflict would " have no benefit . "
british prime minister tony blair 's government has also indicated that gazprom is free to shop for centrica . but the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a stillborn pact medvedev told participants at an economic forum in london last week that the energy pact between russia and the eu was " stillborn . " according to putin 's economic advisor igor shuvalov , this kind of tension was to be understood as part of russia 's growing pains . " russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid , " he said .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.05.2006 poland hits out at germany over gas partnership with russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu gets 26 percent of its natural gas from russian energy giant gazprom while europe is getting increasingly nervous about its reliance on russian natural gas , germany is getting its share of criticism for partnering with russia to build a baltic sea pipeline . poland has again criticized neighboring germany for leaving it out of the picture in a project with russia to build a gas pipeline beneath the baltic sea . " taking the decision first and consulting after is not our idea of solidarity , " defense minister radek sikorski said on sunday during a round table discussion on energy in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish defense minister radek sikorski " germany is an important partner for us .
we are astonished that germany would do something which does n't benefit the consumers and whose geopolitical objective is to be able to cut off belarus and poland without cutting off germany , " he said . " poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head .
that was the locarno tradition , that was the molotov-ribbentrop tradition .
that was the 20th century .
we do n't want any repetition of that , " sikorski said in a reference to hitler 's nonaggression pact with stalin in 1939 which allowed poland to be carved up between the nazis and the soviet union . in early march poland 's conservative president lech kaczynski had already criticized plans for the pipeline saying it was " in flagrant contradiction with polish interests " russian state-controlled energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and e.on agreed in september to build the 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 740-mile -rrb- natural gas pipeline . the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania have also been up in arms over the project .
poland and its baltic neighbors say the pipeline not only deprives them of transit fees , but poses environmental risks and undermines their energy security .
the former soviet union dumped tons of chemical weapons in the baltic sea following world war ii , and construction of the underwater pipeline could disturb them , these countries have said . a heat war ? poland is not the only european country which sees the russian energy supplier as a political and economic hot potato .
tensions between russia and the european union burst into the open last week over gazprom 's hard-headed ambitions to control everything from supply to distribution of european gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's expansion has the blessings of russian president vladimir putin gazprom has a swagger in its giant step and is making some in europe nervous with its sheer size , its control of vast gas reserves and declared intention of getting into the retail end of the industry on european soil . already , the european union gets 26 percent of its natural gas from gazprom and russian president vladimir putin has a blunt response to any eu jitters . " we constantly hear about some threat of dependence on russia and that russian companies should have limited access to the energy market , " he said in the siberian city of tomsk thursday after meeting german chancellor angela merkel .
" what are we to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start to look for other markets . " when gazprom talks , the energy-hungry west listens . a russian giant the company 's market capitalization leapt wednesday to $ 266 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- , making it second only to the us exxonmobil among world energy companies . the semi-public company controls 60 percent of russia 's immense natural gas reserves and has monopoly control over the country 's gas pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gazprom headquaters in moscow now gazprom , whose policies and managers are closely linked to the kremlin , is looking to eat up more than a dozen european assets such as centrica , which distributes gas across half the british market , deputy chairman alexander medvedev said last tuesday . putin this week blasted what he said were moves being considered in britain to block a gazprom acquisition of centrica " under the slightest pretext . " " when people come to us , it is investment and globalization , but if we plan to go somewhere , then it is already the expansion of russian companies . " no reciprocity according to adam landes , oil and gas analyst for renaissance capital , however , gazprom is far from the innocent party it claims to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- russian-german pipeline is scheduled to beging operating in 2010 " there is no reciprocity , gazprom is criticizing europe for not opening its markets but russia is completely shut , " he said .
" gazprom responds ruthlessly to threats ... it always behaved like that . " austrian economy minister martin bartenstein warned that an eu-gazprom conflict would " have no benefit . "
british prime minister tony blair 's government has also indicated that gazprom is free to shop for centrica . but the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a stillborn pact medvedev told participants at an economic forum in london last week that the energy pact between russia and the eu was " stillborn . " according to putin 's economic advisor igor shuvalov , this kind of tension was to be understood as part of russia 's growing pains . " russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid , " he said .
" now we are growing and we raise our voice . " dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel , putin hail gas deal , disagree on iran concluding their two-day summit in siberia , russian and german leaders saw the signing of a major joint venture between companies from both countries to develop a natural gas field .
they failed to agree on iran .
-lrb- apr .

" we have more information than before ... we have made progress but the european union will only appreciate the result , not our efforts , " the minister said . suffocating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica mladic has been wanted since 1995 for genocide and war crimes committed during bosnia 's 1992-95 war .
the genocide charge relates to the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica , considered the worst single atrocity in europe since world war ii . serbian justice minister zoran stojkovic declared that the arrest of mladic , who remains a hero to ardent serb nationalists across the balkans , was now a " technical " matter . capital investments minister velimir ilic appealed in the newspaper politika for the fugitive to give himself up , though he also said he felt belgrade was under " suffocating pressure . " an optimistic note came from erhard busek , the eu 's special coordinator of the stability pact for the balkans , who said mladic would probably be handed over on may 10 . " the latest information i have is that belgrade is now planning to give him up on may 10 , " busek told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung . " the more delays there are , the less credible belgrade gets , " busek noted , calling on the european authorities to act more firmly .
" we need to get tougher and turn our words into actions , " he said . a shrinking country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's impoversihed province of kosovo is likely to become independent serbian ministers ' latest announcements of progress in tracking mladic down are unlikely to convince the eu , which remains skeptical after the recent arrests of five of the suspect 's aides . but belgrade is in a difficult situation .
a postponement of talks with the eu could not come at a worse time .
the country is facing independence claims both from kosovo albanians and from its sister republic montenegro , which is to hold a referendum on may 21 to decide whether to secede from its union with serbia . serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic , in brussels this weekend , admitted that " serbia 's european future " would be " under threat " if the country did not meet its obligations to the icty . " it is as though the hague were our capital , " he said .
" formally , i am in charge of the team of negotiators working on eu accession , but the real bosses are the fugitives wanted by the icty , because the talks ' continuation depends on them .

" we have more information than before ... we have made progress but the european union will only appreciate the result , not our efforts , " the minister said . suffocating pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is held responsible for the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica mladic has been wanted since 1995 for genocide and war crimes committed during bosnia 's 1992-95 war .
the genocide charge relates to the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 muslim men and boys in the eastern bosnian town of srebrenica , considered the worst single atrocity in europe since world war ii . serbian justice minister zoran stojkovic declared that the arrest of mladic , who remains a hero to ardent serb nationalists across the balkans , was now a " technical " matter . capital investments minister velimir ilic appealed in the newspaper politika for the fugitive to give himself up , though he also said he felt belgrade was under " suffocating pressure . " an optimistic note came from erhard busek , the eu 's special coordinator of the stability pact for the balkans , who said mladic would probably be handed over on may 10 . " the latest information i have is that belgrade is now planning to give him up on may 10 , " busek told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung . " the more delays there are , the less credible belgrade gets , " busek noted , calling on the european authorities to act more firmly .
" we need to get tougher and turn our words into actions , " he said . a shrinking country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's impoversihed province of kosovo is likely to become independent serbian ministers ' latest announcements of progress in tracking mladic down are unlikely to convince the eu , which remains skeptical after the recent arrests of five of the suspect 's aides . but belgrade is in a difficult situation .
a postponement of talks with the eu could not come at a worse time .
the country is facing independence claims both from kosovo albanians and from its sister republic montenegro , which is to hold a referendum on may 21 to decide whether to secede from its union with serbia . serbia-montenegro 's foreign minister vuk draskovic , in brussels this weekend , admitted that " serbia 's european future " would be " under threat " if the country did not meet its obligations to the icty . " it is as though the hague were our capital , " he said .
" formally , i am in charge of the team of negotiators working on eu accession , but the real bosses are the fugitives wanted by the icty , because the talks ' continuation depends on them .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .

" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .

following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .

most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 01.05.2006 world-shaping angies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paparazzi love her : chancellor merkel , color-coordinated with her husband a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .
the barman looks at them and asks : " what is this ?
unsexiest people alive ? "
" no , " they respond .
" we rock the world . " sex appeal may be seriously overrated , after all . take german chancellor angela merkel , for example . what does a frowny-faced physicist who grew up in the communist east have in common with us actress , sex bomb , video game impersonator and general goody-goody angelina jolie - other than the similar first name ?
is it those soft , kissable , honey-colored lips of pure delicious lush ?
or is it , perhaps , the sizzling hot passion for the eternally tanned bundle of metrosexual appeal , a.k.a.
brad pitt ?
or is it the fact that paparazzi all over the world are desperately offering their children for sale in exchange for a compromising shot of one of the two angies , in or out of the bathing suit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other angie : actress and un goodwill ambassador jolie none of the above .
both angies , however , along with luminaries ranging from legally blond reese witherspoon to almost illegally ineloquent george w. bush , have made the latest list of 100 people who - for better or worse - shaped our world in 2005 , according to us time magazine . a strange world a world which is shaped , at the same time , albeit in different categories , by cocky standup comedian ellen degeneres and iran 's whacko president and nuclear power buff mahmoud ahmadinejad , is a strange , dislocated kind of the world in which the borders between politics , big business and entertainment are often blurred for the sake of generating media excitement as a kind of postmodern gesamtkunstwerk . which is exactly why it is so remarkable that german chancellor angela merkel - whose all work and no play attitude makes her a perfect , if less entertaining , antipode to her cigar-smoking predecessor gerhard schröder - is rising to such celebrity status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they move in high circles : merkel and pope benedict xvi mekel still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
in one comedy show , she is portrayed by a bearded actor wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , while being dubbed by a radio anchor famous for imitating both the eerie monotony and the subtle fluctuations of merkel 's high-pitched , guttural voice . yet this " dull " and " unexciting " politician is enjoying unprecedented approval ratings .
the economy seems to be picking up , while the morose german landscape has been transformed into what the german magazine der spiegel has called a " land of smiles . " unsexy , but influential the latest list of those who make the world go around confirms the clichéd view of germany as a nation of serious , unsexy people .
german top models heidi klum , claudia schiffer and nadia auermann are nowhere on the list .
neither are young german soccer jocks michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger .
this should make germans proud , because their country can also offer brains , not just brawn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer legend franz beckenbauer the other germans who made it big on the international scene , according to time , are prada wearing pope benedict xvi , 79 ; german soccer legend and president of the organizing committee of the world cup franz beckenbauer , 60 ; and - the young gun , so to speak - daimlerchrysler ceo dieter zetsche , soon to turn 54 . influence on the world stage is , of course , a nebulous concept .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .

" taking the decision first and consulting after is not our idea of solidarity , " defense minister radek sikorski said on sunday during a round table discussion on energy in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish defense minister radek sikorski " germany is an important partner for us .
we are astonished that germany would do something which does n't benefit the consumers and whose geopolitical objective is to be able to cut off belarus and poland without cutting off germany , " he said . " poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head .
that was the locarno tradition , that was the molotov-ribbentrop tradition .
that was the 20th century .
we do n't want any repetition of that , " sikorski said in a reference to hitler 's nonaggression pact with stalin in 1939 which allowed poland to be carved up between the nazis and the soviet union . in early march poland 's conservative president lech kaczynski had already criticized plans for the pipeline saying it was " in flagrant contradiction with polish interests " russian state-controlled energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and e.on agreed in september to build the 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 740-mile -rrb- natural gas pipeline . the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania have also been up in arms over the project .
poland and its baltic neighbors say the pipeline not only deprives them of transit fees , but poses environmental risks and undermines their energy security .
the former soviet union dumped tons of chemical weapons in the baltic sea following world war ii , and construction of the underwater pipeline could disturb them , these countries have said . a heat war ? poland is not the only european country which sees the russian energy supplier as a political and economic hot potato .
tensions between russia and the european union burst into the open last week over gazprom 's hard-headed ambitions to control everything from supply to distribution of european gas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom 's expansion has the blessings of russian president vladimir putin gazprom has a swagger in its giant step and is making some in europe nervous with its sheer size , its control of vast gas reserves and declared intention of getting into the retail end of the industry on european soil . already , the european union gets 26 percent of its natural gas from gazprom and russian president vladimir putin has a blunt response to any eu jitters . " we constantly hear about some threat of dependence on russia and that russian companies should have limited access to the energy market , " he said in the siberian city of tomsk thursday after meeting german chancellor angela merkel .
" what are we to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start to look for other markets . " when gazprom talks , the energy-hungry west listens . a russian giant the company 's market capitalization leapt wednesday to $ 266 billion -lrb- 212 billion euros -rrb- , making it second only to the us exxonmobil among world energy companies . the semi-public company controls 60 percent of russia 's immense natural gas reserves and has monopoly control over the country 's gas pipelines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gazprom headquaters in moscow now gazprom , whose policies and managers are closely linked to the kremlin , is looking to eat up more than a dozen european assets such as centrica , which distributes gas across half the british market , deputy chairman alexander medvedev said last tuesday . putin this week blasted what he said were moves being considered in britain to block a gazprom acquisition of centrica " under the slightest pretext . " " when people come to us , it is investment and globalization , but if we plan to go somewhere , then it is already the expansion of russian companies . " no reciprocity according to adam landes , oil and gas analyst for renaissance capital , however , gazprom is far from the innocent party it claims to be . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- russian-german pipeline is scheduled to beging operating in 2010 " there is no reciprocity , gazprom is criticizing europe for not opening its markets but russia is completely shut , " he said .
" gazprom responds ruthlessly to threats ... it always behaved like that . " austrian economy minister martin bartenstein warned that an eu-gazprom conflict would " have no benefit . "
british prime minister tony blair 's government has also indicated that gazprom is free to shop for centrica . but the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a stillborn pact medvedev told participants at an economic forum in london last week that the energy pact between russia and the eu was " stillborn . " according to putin 's economic advisor igor shuvalov , this kind of tension was to be understood as part of russia 's growing pains . " russia is part of the family ; we were considered the small kid , " he said .
" now we are growing and we raise our voice .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick .

more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .

it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .

the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 01.05.2006 world-shaping angies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paparazzi love her : chancellor merkel , color-coordinated with her husband a politician , an ex-soccer player , a businessman and a pope - all germans - walk into a bar .
the barman looks at them and asks : " what is this ?
unsexiest people alive ? "
" no , " they respond .
" we rock the world . " sex appeal may be seriously overrated , after all . take german chancellor angela merkel , for example . what does a frowny-faced physicist who grew up in the communist east have in common with us actress , sex bomb , video game impersonator and general goody-goody angelina jolie - other than the similar first name ?
is it those soft , kissable , honey-colored lips of pure delicious lush ?
or is it , perhaps , the sizzling hot passion for the eternally tanned bundle of metrosexual appeal , a.k.a.
brad pitt ?
or is it the fact that paparazzi all over the world are desperately offering their children for sale in exchange for a compromising shot of one of the two angies , in or out of the bathing suit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other angie : actress and un goodwill ambassador jolie none of the above .
both angies , however , along with luminaries ranging from legally blond reese witherspoon to almost illegally ineloquent george w. bush , have made the latest list of 100 people who - for better or worse - shaped our world in 2005 , according to us time magazine . a strange world a world which is shaped , at the same time , albeit in different categories , by cocky standup comedian ellen degeneres and iran 's whacko president and nuclear power buff mahmoud ahmadinejad , is a strange , dislocated kind of the world in which the borders between politics , big business and entertainment are often blurred for the sake of generating media excitement as a kind of postmodern gesamtkunstwerk . which is exactly why it is so remarkable that german chancellor angela merkel - whose all work and no play attitude makes her a perfect , if less entertaining , antipode to her cigar-smoking predecessor gerhard schröder - is rising to such celebrity status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they move in high circles : merkel and pope benedict xvi mekel still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
in one comedy show , she is portrayed by a bearded actor wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , while being dubbed by a radio anchor famous for imitating both the eerie monotony and the subtle fluctuations of merkel 's high-pitched , guttural voice . yet this " dull " and " unexciting " politician is enjoying unprecedented approval ratings .

the barman looks at them and asks : " what is this ?
unsexiest people alive ? "
" no , " they respond .
" we rock the world . " sex appeal may be seriously overrated , after all . take german chancellor angela merkel , for example . what does a frowny-faced physicist who grew up in the communist east have in common with us actress , sex bomb , video game impersonator and general goody-goody angelina jolie - other than the similar first name ?
is it those soft , kissable , honey-colored lips of pure delicious lush ?
or is it , perhaps , the sizzling hot passion for the eternally tanned bundle of metrosexual appeal , a.k.a.
brad pitt ?
or is it the fact that paparazzi all over the world are desperately offering their children for sale in exchange for a compromising shot of one of the two angies , in or out of the bathing suit ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other angie : actress and un goodwill ambassador jolie none of the above .
both angies , however , along with luminaries ranging from legally blond reese witherspoon to almost illegally ineloquent george w. bush , have made the latest list of 100 people who - for better or worse - shaped our world in 2005 , according to us time magazine . a strange world a world which is shaped , at the same time , albeit in different categories , by cocky standup comedian ellen degeneres and iran 's whacko president and nuclear power buff mahmoud ahmadinejad , is a strange , dislocated kind of the world in which the borders between politics , big business and entertainment are often blurred for the sake of generating media excitement as a kind of postmodern gesamtkunstwerk . which is exactly why it is so remarkable that german chancellor angela merkel - whose all work and no play attitude makes her a perfect , if less entertaining , antipode to her cigar-smoking predecessor gerhard schröder - is rising to such celebrity status . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they move in high circles : merkel and pope benedict xvi mekel still gets lampooned on german tv on a regular basis .
in one comedy show , she is portrayed by a bearded actor wearing merkel 's favorite peach-colored power suite , while being dubbed by a radio anchor famous for imitating both the eerie monotony and the subtle fluctuations of merkel 's high-pitched , guttural voice . yet this " dull " and " unexciting " politician is enjoying unprecedented approval ratings .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.05.2006 opinion : unions demand much , yet lack vision großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union members at a leipzig rally may 1 is labor day in europe .
this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .

this year , the german confederation of trade unions has organized festivities based on the slogan " your dignity is our yardstick . " " times have gotten tougher : human dignity has become vulnerable again , " michael sommer , director of the german confederation of trade unions said regarding this year 's labor day motto . sommer lists the negative effects of globalization on germans , with one consequence being that employment does not protect people from poverty .
more than 2.5 million people work for poverty wages , which means they earn less than half of the average german gross wage of 1,442 euros a month -lrb- $ 1,820 -rrb- .
another 5 million people work for low wages . that corresponds with statistics the federal statistical office recently published that showed that ever fewer germans can live from gainful employment .
one in three germans , the statistics say , are subsidized by family members - it 's an alarming number . minimum wage is necessary based on those statistics , the german confederation of trade unions is making demands : a minimum wage is needed , for instance .
it says no one should have to work for less than 7.50 euros an hour .
in addition , the confederation is demanding that the german government not loosen job protection protection laws further , as they are economically counterproductive since employed people in secure jobs refrain from spending money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union chief michael sommer -lrb- third from right -rrb- takes charge the confederation believes the announced increase of the retirement age from 65 to 67 should also be repealed since the real age of retirement lies around 60 anyway .
the conderation says that the older age for retirement is nothing other than a disguised attempt to slash pensions . at various labor day rallies around the country , union bosses will be voicing these demands loudly to the government - and will involuntarily anchor a particular image of the unions in the public 's eye .
once viewed as organizations with progressive shaping power , unions are now seen by the public more as conservative institutions constantly defending the status quo . yet impeding or reversing progress , leaving everything as it is - these are not the solutions for the reforms so needed in our society , reforms which surveys show more and more germans feel are necessary . unions losing members the unions therefore should n't be surprised when their members leave the organizations and when employees in small and mid-sized companies , in modern sectors like the it industry , but also women and children , are not interested in being a part of the unions . dignity , solidarity , self-determination , a fair share - all are nice words that unions like to use profusely , but they are not a substitute for solutions to the problems in a society that is becoming increasingly complicated , diverse , labor-divided - and older . rolf wenkel -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de employers warn union pay accord will cost jobs a deal was reached in germany 's metalworking industry over the weekend to give a 3 percent pay hike to the sector 's workers , averting the threat of an all-out strike .
employers , however , say it will cost jobs .

" we are not going to stand by and watch the government take apart the public health system piece by piece , " franz bsirske , the president of the public service trade union verdi , told a protest in berlin . the head of the powerful metal workers ' union ig metall , jürgen peters , said in the southern city of munich that trade unions should stand firm against any attempt to implement " social reforms that take us backwards . "
" we already have five million unemployed people .
and those who have jobs are made to work longer so that those who do n't have even less of a chance of finding work , " he said . bsirske and peters were referring to plans to reform the public health system and to raise the national retirement age to 67 years , up from 63 for women and 65 for men . merkel 's government of christian democrats and social democrats was due to discuss health and tax reforms on monday and to hold talks later in the month on prolonging the traditional trial period of six months for young employees to two years . " france 's problems are germany 's " the president of the german federation of trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , michael sommer , lashed out against the youth contract reform at a rally in wolfsburg , the central city that is home to the headquarters of car maker volkswagen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sommer compared germany to france " the government should not put in place anti-social policies , " sommer said .
evoking the recent outcry in france over a youth jobs law which would have made it easier for companies to hire and fire people under 26 , he added : " what is wrong in france is also wrong in germany . " sommer said the dgb , the umbrella body for german trade unions , was launching a campaign to defend the dignity of workers and lashed out at employers " whose main objective is their own bank accounts and not the dignity of their workers . " demonstrators ' numbers overwhelm neo-nazis in leipzig , neo-nazis and thousands of left-wing protestors pelted each other with stones and bottles , police said .
the violence broke out as some 5,000 people tried to stop protest marches by about 550 neo-nazis in leipzig by blocking the streets with burning trash cans , the police said .
some 2,000 policemen who had been brought in from around the country eventually separated the two groups , arresting 20 people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " no sex with neo-nazis " read the demonstrators ' banner in the northeastern city of rostock some 500 members of germany 's extreme right national democratic party clashed with about 4,000 counter protestors , the police said , adding that they arrested 40 people there . in germany neo-nazi demonstrations often provoke much larger counter protests and end in clashes with the police , particularly on may day . quiet in berlin , so far in berlin 's kreuzberg district , which is home to a large turkish community , several hundred people marched through the streets in support of kurdish and maoist organizations on monday .
police said they were expecting left-wing groups to launch protests in kreuzberg later in the day . the area is known for unrest during walpurgis night , may day 's eve celebrations , which have their roots in a pagan spring rite .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .

" taking the decision first and consulting after is not our idea of solidarity , " defense minister radek sikorski said on sunday during a round table discussion on energy in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish defense minister radek sikorski " germany is an important partner for us .
we are astonished that germany would do something which does n't benefit the consumers and whose geopolitical objective is to be able to cut off belarus and poland without cutting off germany , " he said . " poland has a particular sensitivity to corridors and deals above our head .
that was the locarno tradition , that was the molotov-ribbentrop tradition .
that was the 20th century .
we do n't want any repetition of that , " sikorski said in a reference to hitler 's nonaggression pact with stalin in 1939 which allowed poland to be carved up between the nazis and the soviet union . in early march poland 's conservative president lech kaczynski had already criticized plans for the pipeline saying it was " in flagrant contradiction with polish interests " russian state-controlled energy giant gazprom and german companies basf and e.on agreed in september to build the 1,200-kilometre -lrb- 740-mile -rrb- natural gas pipeline . the baltic states of estonia , latvia and lithuania have also been up in arms over the project .
poland and its baltic neighbors say the pipeline not only deprives them of transit fees , but poses environmental risks and undermines their energy security .
the former soviet union dumped tons of chemical weapons in the baltic sea following world war ii , and construction of the underwater pipeline could disturb them , these countries have said . a heat war ? poland is not the only european country which sees the russian energy supplier as a political and economic hot potato .

" we constantly hear about some threat of dependence on russia and that russian companies should have limited access to the energy market , " he said in the siberian city of tomsk thursday after meeting german chancellor angela merkel .
" what are we to do when we hear the same thing every day ?
we start to look for other markets .

" gazprom responds ruthlessly to threats ... it always behaved like that . " austrian economy minister martin bartenstein warned that an eu-gazprom conflict would " have no benefit . "
british prime minister tony blair 's government has also indicated that gazprom is free to shop for centrica . but the european union has ratcheted up pressure on russia to sign its energy charter , a document that regulates energy transport and would prohibit any signatory from disrupting contracted supplies for any reason . a stillborn pact medvedev told participants at an economic forum in london last week that the energy pact between russia and the eu was " stillborn .

in the pilgrimage season , believers flock by the millions to sacred german sites , renewing their faith along the way . for six months of the year , kevelaer is a quiet little village on the dutch border .
but from may 1 to the end of november , its streets , parking lots and train station are jam-packed with people .
an annual 800,000 religious devotes come to pray at a shrine for the virgin mary , “ the comforter of the grieved . "
young and old come to kevelaer , said karl hagemann from the catholic diocese of münster . " other aspects of catholic tradition , like confession , are dying out in germany , " said hagemann , " but pilgrimage is booming . " guiding the flock along different ways bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three days with cross and banner as far back as the 13th century , christians from all over europe hiked through pelting rain and blinding sun to see the holy relics in trier , aachen or cologne .
a laborious trip was a sign of strong faith .
most of today 's pilgrims take an easier route : day tours in air-conditioned buses , trains and cars . " we have a group of motorcyclists that arrive in july , " said rainer killich , head of the kevelaer pilgrimage bureau .
five cantors are on permanent staff to assist the pilgrims with prayer services and nightly vigils . hermann-josef geus prefers the hard road to kevelaer .
for the past 45 years , he has marched with the kevelaer bruderschaft bonn , a 307-year-old brotherhood dedicated to the pilgrimage .
three days there , three days back , in the heat of july , praying and meditating along the way . " the first time , i prayed that i would pass my apprenticeship test , " geus said .
" and then i did .
so i went back the next year , in thanks .
and from then i just kept on going . " seeing the sites but what is a pilgrimage anyway ?
and how can you tell a spiritual pilgrim from a sight-seeing tourist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands walk the streets of kevelaer " there are n't usually any outwardly signs to go on anymore , no pilgrim 's attire , " said karl hagemann from the münster diocese .
" the pilgrims pray in their buses or on the road , attend a special mass at the site maybe .
but there is the tourist aspect as well .
afterwards they still go to the local café for coffee and cake .
the tourists might have coffee first , and visit the church afterwards . " over one and a half million visitors travelled to the 23 official pilgrimage sites in the münster diocese last year .
but there are no overall statistics for the number of pilgrims underway annually in germany . " a pilgrimage is a trip for spiritual enlightenment , a path to a site for prayer , " said manfred becker-huberti of the archdiocese of cologne .
" the sites are very different : holy relics , or a place where an epiphany - communication with saints - took place , sometimes even a devotional image of the virgin mary .
some are open only in the pilgrimage season , which has its roots in pagan may traditions , others are open year round .
the faithful themselves turn a place into a pilgrimage site by going there . " millions of young people flocked to cologne last summer for world youth day .
their positive feedback has inspired the archdiocese of cologne to reinstate its famous medieval pilgrimage to the remains of the three wise men in the cologne cathedral .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi and others pilger to the three wise men 's shrine in cologne " there was a huge demand to get close to the relics , " said manfred becker-huberti .
" we have invited european diocese to come for a visit in september .
they will be able to get very close , to bask in the aura of the three kings . " tradition and religious trend pilgrim hermann-josef geus has witnessed the ups and downs of pilgrimage in germany .
following world war ii and into the mid 1970s , christians began to leave the church , and visitors to traditional sites like altöttingen in bavaria dropped to record lows .
only 35 people trekked in geus ' group in 1974 .
last year , 160 pilgrims made the trip from bonn on foot , another 600 met the group in kevelaer to celebrate . " the majority are older , between 50 and 70 , " hermann geus said .
" but we have a strong group of young people as well , in their mid-20s . " " people , especially young people , want to celebrate their religion as a group , " karl hagemann from the münster diocese agreed .
" it brings them together , gives them a feeling of community . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann-josef und erika geus , married for 36 years geus can attest to this from personal experience .
he went to kevelaer looking for the virgin mary and found someone else instead . " i met erika on her first pilgrimage to kevelaer in 1968 .
she was only here in bonn for a year , doing an apprenticeship .
she usually went to trier to pray , but that year she could n't get the time off , so she came with us .
i guess you could say it was luck - or a divine coincidence . " two years later , the two were married .
it was a match made in heaven . kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bavarian pope revitalizes catholic church in germany the election of a german pope has revived the once flagging fortunes of the roman catholic church in germany , bringing people back to the fold and inspiring the affection of younger worshippers , observers say .

lara croft of tomb raider fame has gone on to become one of the most famous virtual celebrities .

instead , they have been somewhat of an estranged couple .
he left shortly after the first tomb raider game , angry with how lara was being sexed up .
the most visible sign of this was lara 's breast augmentation .
but the subsequent five sequels also strayed from the original tomb raider formula .
lara 's reputation as the leading lady of video games reached a nadir three years ago with the release of tomb raider : angel of darkness .
the widely derided game tested the faith of even the most dedicated fans , as did an equally poor film , cradle of life .

" i felt like i had a wayward child and had to do one of those intervention things . "
the most visible sign of his intervention is lara 's look .

but he also wanted the game to return to the basics of exploration and puzzle-solving that made the original tomb raider such a hit .
shortly after he joined the team working on legend , mr gard convinced them to scrap the original script for the game .
he spent some eight months rewriting the story , so that it was closer to the themes of the original tomb raider .
" as a character , lara croft is about delving into history , " said mr gard .
" it is about looking into the unexplained .
" at its heart , it is about uncovering mysteries and exploration . "
lara 's rebirth lara still wields her trademark dual pistols in legend , but there is less of an emphasis on shooting enemies .
the reworking of the tomb raider franchise has hit a chord with gamers and critics alike .
the game has topped the charts in the uk and across europe , riding a wave of overwhelmingly positive reviews .
legend is the seventh title to be released in the tomb raider series , one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time , with more than 28 million copies sold .
mr gard sees legend as the rebirth of lara and is already thinking about ideas for the next tomb raider game .
" i really think there is a lot more to be done with her character , " he said .

the agreement between cyclists and the snowdonia national park authority is now entering its third year .
people are urged to take notice of the agreement to avoid the need for a formal regulation of mountain use .
however , cyclists have said they would prefer some routes to be kept open for their use .

the voluntary agreement was revised in 2003 by cyclists touring club cymru -lrb- ctc -rrb- , the welsh cycling union and the international mountain bicycling organisation .

but it quickly turned to disaster .
although they are of themselves no more than a tiny sequence of numbers , there are some dates that carry entire stories within them .
none more so in industrial britain than 1926 , the year of the general strike , a time when the country seemed as though it might be on the brink of revolution .
and even today , long after practically everyone who was personally involved has died , you can still start an argument about it .
it 's a story of hope and betrayal , of sacrifice , defiance and , ultimately , a defeat that rankled bitterly decades on .
it was what the rhymney poet idris davies described as the great dream and the swift disaster .
for most of those involved -lrb- and the general strike was n't all that general -rrb- it was simply a spasm of protest that in the end achieved nothing the strike was called by the tuc for one minute to midnight on 3 may , 1926 .
it was an unprecedented show of solidarity with the miners - a million of them throughout britain at that time - who were under pressure to work longer hours for less money .
it was to be a trial of strength between organised labour and the establishment as represented by the coal owners and the government .
nine days later it was all over .
the strike may have represented the peak of trade union power the strike had begun to crumble almost before it had begun and it was called off without a single concession being made to the miners ' case .
for most of those involved -lrb- and the general strike was n't all that general -rrb- it was simply a spasm of protest that in the end achieved nothing .
but for many of britain 's miners it was only a beginning .
huge community effort in some of the coalfields , south wales in particular , there was no return to work .
it was n't a strike , those involved said , but a lockout by the owners .
through the summer and into the winter they stayed out .
the atmosphere of that period was curiously mixed - part grim struggle , part festival .
there was a huge community effort to provide food and clothes for the thousands of families who had nothing .
but at the same time they organised cricket matches , boxing tournaments , musical entertainments and fancy dress competitions .
their emotions were astonishingly fresh , in particular their fierce antagonism towards those they blamed for their defeat any sense of carnival disappeared soon enough as the months wore on .
resolution inevitably cracked and increasing numbers of men went back to work .
those who stayed out fought with police brought in to protect working miners .
finally , in december , the dispute ended , not by agreement but through sheer attrition .
trade union membership and power have waned over the years the miners went back to work without having gained a single concession from the owners .
those are the bare bones of a story that has resonated round industrial britain ever since .
thirty years ago i talked to people who had been active in it .
even half a century on their memories and their emotions were astonishingly fresh , in particular their fierce antagonism towards those they blamed for their defeat - owners , government and , most resented of all , other trade unions .
the spirit of that time , a sense that there were old grievances to be settled , coloured attitudes generations on .
so much so that when you look at the last miners ' strike , that year of explosive conflict between 1984 and 1985 , you ca n't avoid a sense of the cause of the general strike being restaged in another era .
this time , though , the disaster was final , for 1985 effectively marked the end of coal as a significant british industry .
there was no longer any dream for the miners to cling on to .
great dream , swift disaster is on bbc radio wales from monday , 1 may to thursday , 4 may -lrb- 1830 bst -rrb- and on friday 5 may -lrb- 1800 bst -rrb- .
