if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

" our goal is clear .
we want to get rid of all those involved in doping , " federation president rudolf scharping said .
" we have had very intense discussions and we have all reached the same conclusions . " the summit on the eve of the hamburg cyclassics , germany 's only one-day protour event , comes in the wake of cycling 's latest doping storm triggered by american tour de france winner floyd landis failing a doping test . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich just before the race started on july 1 , german winner of the 1997 tour jan ullrich was suspended and later sacked by his t-mobile team over his implication in spain 's high-profile doping investigation . the key to tackling drug cheats was drawing up individual profiles on each rider to improve the effectiveness of testing , scharping said . " the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .
but he added : " the framework for the fight against doping is n't the most important thing .
what is important is that it is effective .

" the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.07.2006 retinal implants are ray of hope for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breakthrough for many blind people could be in sight researchers in aachen have developed retinal implants that synthetically reproduce aspects of sight .
the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-
on top of that there are the monthly maintenance costs .
but keskin believes the positive feedback from the visitors has made it a good investment . ' ' many visitors have already asked us if we have addresses for mosques nearby , so that they can get more information about islam . "

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .

schumacher also cut the gap to championship leader fernando alonso from 17 to 11 points after the spaniard struggled to fifth place in his renault . for massa , the result equalled his best finish in formula one , and was his third visit to the podium this year . kimi raikkonen , who started from pole position , came home third for mclaren , but only after making a stunning passing maneuver on briton jenson button 's honda with eight laps to go . " it was a surprise being so far in front of our rivals , but we 'll take it , " said schumacher .
" we had a superb weekend . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferrari driver michael schumacher in the lead as usual massa said : " i 'm getting used to the podium , not in first place , but my time will come . " a one-two finish was our target , especially after seeing our pace yesterday morning .
we thought we 'd be very strong . " surprised at own dominance michael schumacher could not hide his surprise at ferrari 's dominance after the win . he told a news conference immediately after the race that although he was delighted with his 89th formula one win and his 70th for ferrari , even he was surprised just how easily it came .

" our goal is clear .
we want to get rid of all those involved in doping , " federation president rudolf scharping said .
" we have had very intense discussions and we have all reached the same conclusions . " the summit on the eve of the hamburg cyclassics , germany 's only one-day protour event , comes in the wake of cycling 's latest doping storm triggered by american tour de france winner floyd landis failing a doping test . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich just before the race started on july 1 , german winner of the 1997 tour jan ullrich was suspended and later sacked by his t-mobile team over his implication in spain 's high-profile doping investigation . the key to tackling drug cheats was drawing up individual profiles on each rider to improve the effectiveness of testing , scharping said . " the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .
but he added : " the framework for the fight against doping is n't the most important thing .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors .

"
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal .

" blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .
" we have repeatedly called on the israelis to act proportionately . " european commission spokeswoman katharina von schnurbein said : " the commission has repeatedly requested that both parties come to a ceasefire as soon as possible and that under all circumstances both parties should stick to humanitarian norms and international law , " from his summer residence north of rome , pope benedict xvi appealed for an immediate ceasefire to end a crisis he described as " ever more tragic . " " in the name of god , i call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides , " he told the faithful from his summer residence north of rome . threats of escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah leader sheik hassan nasrallah making a televised statement the attacks came after defiant hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah vowed to strike cities in the center of the country if the jewish state continued to attack civilians in lebanon . hamas , the palestinian ruling islamist movement , warned sunday that " all options were open " against israel after the raid . israel , backed by the united states , has refused to set a date for ending its war on the shiite muslim group that has made hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed much of lebanon 's infrastructure . in a televised speech apparently timed to coincide with rice 's arrival , nasrallah accused the top us diplomat of returning to the region just to impose " conditions " on lebanon as part of plans to create a new middle east order . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland had appealed for a truce to allow casualties to be removed and food and medicine to be sent into the war zone , saying one third of the casualties were children . but an israeli foreign ministry official said a ceasefire was unacceptable because hezbollah " would exploit it to gather civilians to use them as a human shield in the combat zone " . bush and blair us president george w. bush stressed in his weekly radio address that " militias in lebanon must be disarmed , the flow of illegal arms must be halted , and the lebanese security services should deploy throughout the country " . he said that during his meetings with british prime minister tony blair in washington friday they agreed that a " robust multinational force must be dispatched to lebanon quickly . " blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .
" we have repeatedly called on the israelis to act proportionately . " european commission spokeswoman katharina von schnurbein said : " the commission has repeatedly requested that both parties come to a ceasefire as soon as possible and that under all circumstances both parties should stick to humanitarian norms and international law , " from his summer residence north of rome , pope benedict xvi appealed for an immediate ceasefire to end a crisis he described as " ever more tragic . " " in the name of god , i call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides , " he told the faithful from his summer residence north of rome . threats of escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah leader sheik hassan nasrallah making a televised statement the attacks came after defiant hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah vowed to strike cities in the center of the country if the jewish state continued to attack civilians in lebanon . hamas , the palestinian ruling islamist movement , warned sunday that " all options were open " against israel after the raid . israel , backed by the united states , has refused to set a date for ending its war on the shiite muslim group that has made hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed much of lebanon 's infrastructure . in a televised speech apparently timed to coincide with rice 's arrival , nasrallah accused the top us diplomat of returning to the region just to impose " conditions " on lebanon as part of plans to create a new middle east order . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland had appealed for a truce to allow casualties to be removed and food and medicine to be sent into the war zone , saying one third of the casualties were children . but an israeli foreign ministry official said a ceasefire was unacceptable because hezbollah " would exploit it to gather civilians to use them as a human shield in the combat zone " . bush and blair us president george w. bush stressed in his weekly radio address that " militias in lebanon must be disarmed , the flow of illegal arms must be halted , and the lebanese security services should deploy throughout the country " . he said that during his meetings with british prime minister tony blair in washington friday they agreed that a " robust multinational force must be dispatched to lebanon quickly . " blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.07.2006 retinal implants are ray of hope for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breakthrough for many blind people could be in sight researchers in aachen have developed retinal implants that synthetically reproduce aspects of sight .
the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .

a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .

a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .

the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .

" blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .
" we have repeatedly called on the israelis to act proportionately . " european commission spokeswoman katharina von schnurbein said : " the commission has repeatedly requested that both parties come to a ceasefire as soon as possible and that under all circumstances both parties should stick to humanitarian norms and international law , " from his summer residence north of rome , pope benedict xvi appealed for an immediate ceasefire to end a crisis he described as " ever more tragic . " " in the name of god , i call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides , " he told the faithful from his summer residence north of rome . threats of escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah leader sheik hassan nasrallah making a televised statement the attacks came after defiant hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah vowed to strike cities in the center of the country if the jewish state continued to attack civilians in lebanon . hamas , the palestinian ruling islamist movement , warned sunday that " all options were open " against israel after the raid . israel , backed by the united states , has refused to set a date for ending its war on the shiite muslim group that has made hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed much of lebanon 's infrastructure . in a televised speech apparently timed to coincide with rice 's arrival , nasrallah accused the top us diplomat of returning to the region just to impose " conditions " on lebanon as part of plans to create a new middle east order . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland had appealed for a truce to allow casualties to be removed and food and medicine to be sent into the war zone , saying one third of the casualties were children . but an israeli foreign ministry official said a ceasefire was unacceptable because hezbollah " would exploit it to gather civilians to use them as a human shield in the combat zone " . bush and blair us president george w. bush stressed in his weekly radio address that " militias in lebanon must be disarmed , the flow of illegal arms must be halted , and the lebanese security services should deploy throughout the country " . he said that during his meetings with british prime minister tony blair in washington friday they agreed that a " robust multinational force must be dispatched to lebanon quickly . " blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict .

" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors .

" the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

we thought we 'd be very strong . " surprised at own dominance michael schumacher could not hide his surprise at ferrari 's dominance after the win . he told a news conference immediately after the race that although he was delighted with his 89th formula one win and his 70th for ferrari , even he was surprised just how easily it came . " our car just functioned really great , " said schumacher .
" we had a good work out before coming here , in the last test before the summer break . " it is a package that is the reason we can perform as we do perform , but it is a bit of a surprise being that much in front .

" our goal is clear .
we want to get rid of all those involved in doping , " federation president rudolf scharping said .
" we have had very intense discussions and we have all reached the same conclusions .

" the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .
" we have repeatedly called on the israelis to act proportionately . " european commission spokeswoman katharina von schnurbein said : " the commission has repeatedly requested that both parties come to a ceasefire as soon as possible and that under all circumstances both parties should stick to humanitarian norms and international law , " from his summer residence north of rome , pope benedict xvi appealed for an immediate ceasefire to end a crisis he described as " ever more tragic . " " in the name of god , i call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides , " he told the faithful from his summer residence north of rome . threats of escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah leader sheik hassan nasrallah making a televised statement the attacks came after defiant hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah vowed to strike cities in the center of the country if the jewish state continued to attack civilians in lebanon . hamas , the palestinian ruling islamist movement , warned sunday that " all options were open " against israel after the raid . israel , backed by the united states , has refused to set a date for ending its war on the shiite muslim group that has made hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed much of lebanon 's infrastructure . in a televised speech apparently timed to coincide with rice 's arrival , nasrallah accused the top us diplomat of returning to the region just to impose " conditions " on lebanon as part of plans to create a new middle east order . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland had appealed for a truce to allow casualties to be removed and food and medicine to be sent into the war zone , saying one third of the casualties were children . but an israeli foreign ministry official said a ceasefire was unacceptable because hezbollah " would exploit it to gather civilians to use them as a human shield in the combat zone " . bush and blair us president george w. bush stressed in his weekly radio address that " militias in lebanon must be disarmed , the flow of illegal arms must be halted , and the lebanese security services should deploy throughout the country " . he said that during his meetings with british prime minister tony blair in washington friday they agreed that a " robust multinational force must be dispatched to lebanon quickly . " blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal .

" our goal is clear .
we want to get rid of all those involved in doping , " federation president rudolf scharping said .
" we have had very intense discussions and we have all reached the same conclusions .

" the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-
on top of that there are the monthly maintenance costs .
but keskin believes the positive feedback from the visitors has made it a good investment . ' ' many visitors have already asked us if we have addresses for mosques nearby , so that they can get more information about islam . "

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-
on top of that there are the monthly maintenance costs .
but keskin believes the positive feedback from the visitors has made it a good investment . ' ' many visitors have already asked us if we have addresses for mosques nearby , so that they can get more information about islam . "

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

" our goal is clear .
we want to get rid of all those involved in doping , " federation president rudolf scharping said .
" we have had very intense discussions and we have all reached the same conclusions .

" the federation will refuse to select cyclists for big championships if they have not submitted all the required information , " he said . a former government minister , scharping said germany should also consider drawing up legislation to counter doping in sport .

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place . " we change the clocks every year , why not our work schedules ? " he said .
" people can take a little nap at noon and then with new energy work longer in the evenings . " while the worst of the recent heat wave appears to be over , according to reports , this july has been the hottest since records began being kept some 100 years ago . but employers ' groups , trade unions and industry associations have thrown cold water on the idea , saying the current work rules are fine the way they are , and anyway , a siesta would only make sense for those whose jobs have them working in the heat and sun . still , none of them wants a mandated nap time . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boring phone call puts man to sleep , brings out police a less-than-sparkling phone conversation prompted an emergency alert when a german man nodded off while talking to his girlfriend , authorities said tuesday .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .
i have several members of the family inside and i do not think that there will be any other survivors . " the army also rejected any responsibility for the civilian deaths in qana , saying hezbollah used the village as a base to launch rockets , and that residents had already been ordered to leave . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the first time qana has been hit - this scene is from 1996 the village , said by some to be where jesus turned water into wine , is also the site of an israeli bombing of a un base in april 1996 that killed 105 people during israel 's " grapes of wrath " offensive - also aimed at wiping out hezbollah . rice confirmed she had cancelled plans to go to beirut sunday after the attack .
she told reporters in jerusalem she was " deeply saddened " by the deaths . un headquarters stormed angry protestors attacked and broke into the united nations headquarters in beirut on sunday after the israeli raids on qana . the demonstrators hurled stones at the building and smashed windows with rocks and iron bars before penetrating the building from the main door , they said .
the protestors burned curtains and destroyed furniture inside the building , they said . " feltman out now ! " they shouted in unison , in reference to us ambassador jeffrey feltman . a un employee told afp that the un staff in the building had sought refuge in an underground basement . european reaction reactions poured in from europe as news of the civilian deaths become known . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday 's events showed again that " the highest priority must now be a ceasefire as quickly as possible . "
steinmeier said in a statement that he had " learned with horror " of the deaths of civilians . french president jacques chirac strongly denounced the bombardment of the village . " france condemns this unjustifiable action which shows more than ever the need to agree on an immediate ceasefire , without which these kind of tragedies will only be repeated , " chirac said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice speaks with israeli defense minister amir peretz in jerusalem britain 's foreign secretary margaret beckett told sky news that the incident was a tragedy and a setback for any peace deal . " it 's absolutely dreadful , it 's quite appalling .
undoubtedly today 's events will make things worse at least in the short term , " she said in the sunday interview , although she stopped short of calling for a ceasefire .
" we have repeatedly called on the israelis to act proportionately . " european commission spokeswoman katharina von schnurbein said : " the commission has repeatedly requested that both parties come to a ceasefire as soon as possible and that under all circumstances both parties should stick to humanitarian norms and international law , " from his summer residence north of rome , pope benedict xvi appealed for an immediate ceasefire to end a crisis he described as " ever more tragic . " " in the name of god , i call on all those responsible for this spiral of violence so that weapons are immediately laid down on all sides , " he told the faithful from his summer residence north of rome . threats of escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah leader sheik hassan nasrallah making a televised statement the attacks came after defiant hezbollah leader hassan nasrallah vowed to strike cities in the center of the country if the jewish state continued to attack civilians in lebanon . hamas , the palestinian ruling islamist movement , warned sunday that " all options were open " against israel after the raid . israel , backed by the united states , has refused to set a date for ending its war on the shiite muslim group that has made hundreds of thousands homeless and destroyed much of lebanon 's infrastructure . in a televised speech apparently timed to coincide with rice 's arrival , nasrallah accused the top us diplomat of returning to the region just to impose " conditions " on lebanon as part of plans to create a new middle east order . un humanitarian coordinator jan egeland had appealed for a truce to allow casualties to be removed and food and medicine to be sent into the war zone , saying one third of the casualties were children . but an israeli foreign ministry official said a ceasefire was unacceptable because hezbollah " would exploit it to gather civilians to use them as a human shield in the combat zone " . bush and blair us president george w. bush stressed in his weekly radio address that " militias in lebanon must be disarmed , the flow of illegal arms must be halted , and the lebanese security services should deploy throughout the country " . he said that during his meetings with british prime minister tony blair in washington friday they agreed that a " robust multinational force must be dispatched to lebanon quickly . " blair said world powers would meet at the un monday to discuss the possible deployment of a multinational force .
but syria said it would simply be an " occupation force " that served israel 's interests . the british leader defended his siding with bush on the lebanese crisis , and brushed off mounting protests back home about the use of a scottish airport by us jets carrying weapons bound for israel . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rome meeting fails to agree on ceasefire , pledges " urgency " a 15-nation crisis conference failed wednesday to agree on calling for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east but vowed to work with " utmost urgency " for a truce .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .

this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

hundreds of protestors stormed un headquarters in beirut . the raid on the southern village of qana was the deadliest single strike since the jewish state unleashed its war on hezbollah 19 days ago .
it killed more than 50 people , including 37 children . lebanese prime minister fuad siniora denounced the attack as a " war crime , " demanding an immediate ceasefire in a bloody conflict that has now killed more than 500 people and left a trail of destruction across the country . rescue workers with only their bare hands clawed through rubble of flattened homes to find survivors from the raid on qana , launched just as us secretary of state condoleezza rice was back in the region pursuing a new round of diplomacy to try to end the conflict . " the bombing was so intense that no-one could move , " said a distraught ibrahim shalhoub , 26 .
" i succeeded in getting out and everything collapsed .

if you ca n't beat the heat … .take a nap .
people in southern european countries do , some politicians are asking : in this record heat , why not in germany ? the word siesta conjures up images of dusty , sun-drenched , small-town streets .
the heat of mid-day has put everyone into a torpor , driving them inside to catch some down time behind closed shutters in cool , darkened rooms . it 's not exactly what comes to mind when thinking of germany , where often cloudy skies and cool temperatures have made a mid-day retreat from the heat not that necessary . but now that summers appear to be turning mediterranean even up in germany , some social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- and green party politicians began calling last week for the country to import the tradition from the sunny south . " i am for the introduction of a so-called siesta between 12 and 4 p.m. , " said former spd general secretary klaus-uwe benneter in a newspaper interview .
" here in central europe , we 're going to have to attune ourselves over the long term to a southern european climate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this pup has the right idea green parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele also sees good reason for some mid-day snooze time , calling for a one-and-a-half to two-hour siesta to be put into place .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-
on top of that there are the monthly maintenance costs .
but keskin believes the positive feedback from the visitors has made it a good investment . ' ' many visitors have already asked us if we have addresses for mosques nearby , so that they can get more information about islam . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.07.2006 retinal implants are ray of hope for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breakthrough for many blind people could be in sight researchers in aachen have developed retinal implants that synthetically reproduce aspects of sight .
the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .
in front of the screen , theater-style chairs have been set up .
a school group from hanau recently settled down and watched the film with visible interest . ' ' i think it 's great that they take this into the public , " said one of the german students .
' ' we also talk about these things in the school .
we have a high number of foreigners , especially turks , " she said , adding that it is important to bring the islamobil to people ' ' who normally are n't interested in the subject . " attracti n g all ages the mobile mosque attracts visitors of all ages .
one elderly woman said she found it good that the islamobil answered questions about social groups like families and women . ' ' there is a lot of information here that i 've never seen in this form before .
i think it 's very interesting , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sehitlik mosque in berlin is the city 's largest .
the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .
" we wanted to confront people directly and say either inform yourself or do n't . "
the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-
on top of that there are the monthly maintenance costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.07.2006 retinal implants are ray of hope for the blind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breakthrough for many blind people could be in sight researchers in aachen have developed retinal implants that synthetically reproduce aspects of sight .
the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot .

the goal of the project is for muslims to reach out to non-muslims , instead of waiting for the reverse to happen , said keskin , thus , the idea to bring the cultural dialogue directly to the germans where they live . ' ' for us it was important to be provocative , " keskin said .

the confrontation should be understood as positive , not negative , keskin added . the islamobil costs 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 315,000 . -rrb-

they hope their ' ' rolling mosque " will help change german public opinion , which often associates islam and muslims with terror and fanaticism . on a recent friday afternoon , a truck with a large trailer pulled up across from the historic town hall in hanau , near frankfurt .
oriental music blasted from the speakers , attracting attention . a stage had been built on top of the trailer .
a cupola and two minarets soared above the roof .
pillars and arches decorated the sides .
alongside was written " islamobil , " a word made up from the german words for islam and automobile . the islamobil is a sort of travelling mosque , one that aims to inform germans about islam .
a group of young muslims from the small city of brühl near cologne came up with the idea in 2001 and will travel around germany with it this summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims pray in a berlin mosque one of the founders , gülüzar keskin , said the idea was born out of the desire to explain and illustrate islam on-the-spot . ' ' first we established an organization with the goal of informing germans about islam , " keskin said .
' ' then we thought it would be a very good and practical idea to create a mobile mosque and travel around germany in it . " the image of islam and muslims has deteriorated in germany since the terrorism attacks on sept.11 , 2001 .
many citizens associate the religion with terror , fanaticism and the repression of women .
the organizers hope the islamobil will correct this picture . religio n o n display inside the islamobil , a cool , comfortable atmosphere dominates .
on the ceiling , mounted lights illuminate the room .
some visitors pause to read from the information boards hung on the walls that explain the history and basic principals of islam .
others keep themselves busy looking at small monitors .
here , at the touch of the fingers , visitors can find information about islam and also access a call to prayer . tayyib shamsuddin , from the muslim working committee of hanau , said the display allows people to ' ' find out about islam , what it means to be muslim and the basic principals of the religion like fasting , praying and this and that . ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the headscarf is one of the most visible symbols of islam to the rear of the room is a large flat screen that shows a short film about the different kinds of mosque construction and the meaning that mosques have for muslims .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

the devices could bring light to sufferers of different forms of blindness when they hit the market in a few years . twenty years ago , hans-joachim sturm was told that he had retinitis pigmentosa .
he did n't know what to think at first , but would soon become well acquainted with this eye ailment . retinitis pigmentosa is an incurable , hereditary disease that slowly kills the light-sensitive cells on the retina until the patient is left in darkness .
sturm is one of 40,000 sufferers of the disease in germany . " after a year , you see even less … " " it goes slowly , with spurts of digression from time to time .
for a long period , things stay the same and you do n't notice anything and then , suddenly , what you were just recently able to see is n't there anymore .
after a year , you see even less , and it continues like that , " said 64-year-old sturm . first signs of the eye disease are a loss of color and contrast in the vision or night blindness .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another artificial eye , but this one by artist anne rose bekker ca n't help you see though the light-sensitive retinal cells die off , the nerve cells behind them , which transfer information to the brain , remain up to 30 percent intact .
this means that if visual stimuli could circumvent the damaged retina , the patient would be capable of seeing again . with this point in mind , researchers at the rwth aachen university of technology developed a special device for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa .
the prosthetic consists of two parts : a high-tech pair of glasses and an implant that is surgically placed in the eye . a tiny video camera is built into the glasses , along with an encoder that converts images into signals the nerves understand .
the signals are then sent wirelessly to a receiver that has been implanted into the ocular lens . the signals are then transferred to a micro contact film via a miniscule cable .
these lie directly on the retina and stimulate with electrodes the nerve cells that lead to the optic nerve . in this way , a person blinded by retinitis pigmentosa can see what the camera sees - almost . not exactly 20-20 " the picture that the patient sees is very dim at the beginning , " said peter walter from the university clinic in aachen .
" but it can help a blind patient to differentiate between day and night , perhaps to get out of the way of large objects , circumnavigate obstacles , and recognize doors and windows . unfortunately , the implants can not restore the ability to read or recognize faces , said walter . the resolution of the picture transferred through the device is dependent on the number of electrodes on the retina , which is limited to 200 to 300 .
conducting more energy to the eye heats it up , which could cause complete damage . as of yet , no solution has been found to counter this limitation .
however , interest in retina implant research is strong and several research teams around the world are at work . next to germany , research is most advanced in the us , especially at universities in boston and baltimore . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently being tested on animals , the implants have n't been used on human eyes yet similar to the german model , scientists at john hopkins university in baltimore are experimenting with the stimulation of nerve cells via short electronic impulses so that the brain can perceive pictures once again . experts at boston 's harvard medical school have developed an approach together with the massachusetts institute of technology that could protect the eye from overheating : they are working on a film structure with micro contacts that can be placed between the light-sensitive cells on the retina and the nerve cells . broad application makes implants interesting the us national institute of health has supported the research with more than $ 12 million so far .
interest is so high in the retinal implant project because it can be useful to more than just the relatively small number of retinitis pigmentosa patients . " i can imagine that we might be able to help patients suffering from macula degeneration , " said wilfried mokwa from the aachen institute for electro-technology , referring to an age-related form of blindness that is much more common than retinitis pigmentosa . but research still has a long way to go .
the retinal implants are currently being tested on animals in aachen and , if everything goes well , will be used by humans for the first time at the end of the year .
experts expect it to take five to seven years before the implants reach the market . ingo wagner -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu agrees to limited use of funds in stem cell research in a compromise deal that will allow current large-scale projects the finances they need to continue running , the eu agreed monday to allow limited amounts of bloc funding for stem cell research .

jim dooley was a member of the dooleys , a band which appeared on the show 21 times .
here , he remembers what it was like to perform on top of the pops for the first time . "
after seven years of playing the live circuit in britain we got the call that we 'd waited so desperately for .
we were booked to appear on top of the pops .
i remember us dancing around in our underwear in our bedsit in worsley in manchester .
we were a band of three brothers , three sisters and a brother-in-law . "
our first appearance on the show in august 1977 was a life-changing experience " on 4 august 1977 we were to appear with our first single " think i 'm going to fall in love with you " .
it was the first of seven appearances we were to make that year .
overnight sensation in the 1970s everyone watched top of the pops and the programme had the ability to quite literally turn you into an overnight sensation .
the condition for appearing was simple .
you had to perform if you were a british act and available in the uk at the time .
in those days the show was broadcast on a thursday so we had to be in london on a tuesday to start our preparations .
first we 'd have to record the track which was to be played on the show .
at the time facilities at the bbc were pretty archaic so we were allowed to use a proper recording studio in willesden in north london .
on wednesday we had to be at bbc television centre in west london to start the studio rehearsals .
the morning session was for us to practice our dance moves and for the cameramen to plot how they were going to film us .
wednesday afternoon would be a full dress rehearsal and and that evening the show would be recorded .
our first appearance was alongside a band called the floaters and the jam .
exhilarating " top of the pops was all about a passion for the music " we were in the north east , to play at the stockton fiesta , and watched the broadcast on thursday night .
it was the most exhilarating feeling to see ourselves playing on what was the greatest music show in the world .
i still watch top of the pops and will be pretty sad to see it go .
it was a reflection of a vibrant british music scene .
i think a lot of the people working in the industry today just do n't have passion for the music anymore .
that is what the show was all about . "

jim dooley was a member of the dooleys , a band which appeared on the show 21 times .
here , he remembers what it was like to perform on top of the pops for the first time .
after seven years of playing the live circuit in britain we got the call that we 'd waited so desperately for .
we were booked to appear on top of the pops .
i remember us dancing around in our underwear in our bedsit in worsley in manchester .
we were a band of three brothers , three sisters and a brother-in-law .
our first appearance on the show in august 1977 was a life-changing experience on 4 august 1977 we were to appear with our first single " think i 'm going to fall in love with you " .
it was the first of seven appearances we were to make that year .
overnight sensation in the 1970s everyone watched top of the pops and the programme had the ability to quite literally turn you into an overnight sensation .
jim -lrb- right -rrb- and the band appear for the first time on the show the condition for appearing was simple .
you had to perform if you were a british act and available in the uk at the time .
in those days the show was broadcast on a thursday so we had to be in london on a tuesday to start our preparations .
first we 'd have to record the track which was to be played on the show .
at the time facilities at the bbc were pretty archaic so we were allowed to use a proper recording studio in willesden in north london .
on wednesday we had to be at bbc television centre in west london to start the studio rehearsals .
the morning session was for us to practice our dance moves and for the cameramen to plot how they were going to film us .
wednesday afternoon would be a full dress rehearsal and and that evening the show would be recorded .
our first appearance was alongside a band called the floaters and the jam .
exhilarating top of the pops was all about a passion for the music we were in the north east , to play at the stockton fiesta , and watched the broadcast on thursday night .
it was the most exhilarating feeling to see ourselves playing on what was the greatest music show in the world .
i still watch top of the pops and will be pretty sad to see it go .
it was a reflection of a vibrant british music scene .
i think a lot of the people working in the industry today just do n't have passion for the music anymore .
that is what the show was all about .

" the arresting officer was just doing his job and i feel fortunate that i was apprehended before i caused injury to any other person , " he said .
gibson said he " acted like a person completely out of control " when he was arrested and said things " that i do not believe to be true and which are despicable " .
" i take this opportunity to apologise to the deputies involved for my belligerent behaviour , " he said .
" they have always been there for me in my community and indeed probably saved me from myself . "
' cover-up ' gibson did not explain the offensive comments and a detective from the los angeles county sheriff 's department also declined to comment on the actor 's behaviour .
however sergeant john hocking told the ap news agency detectives would begin investigating the incident on monday .
sheriff lee baca denied that his department were trying to cover up gibson 's alleged behaviour .
" there is no cover-up .
our job is not to -lrb- focus -rrb- on what he said .
it 's to establish his blood-alcohol level when he was driving and proceed with the case , " sheriff baca told the los angeles times .
steve whitmore , a spokesman for the department , also would not comment on what gibson said but he added that the department would eventually release details of the arrest , the new york times reported .
" nothing will be sanitised , " mr whitmore said in a statement .
gibson 's bail has been set at $ 5,000 -lrb- £ 2,680 -rrb- .
devout catholic gibson won a best director oscar for his 1995 film braveheart , in which he also starred .
