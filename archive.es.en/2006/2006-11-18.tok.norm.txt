still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .
it had to be fished out with a stomach tube that had small pincers on one end . however , it appears that the ring had nothing directly to do with the severe abdominal distress , according to police .
the reason for the sudden , and costly , tummy ache is not known . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bees stolen in professional sting usually it 's the police who are involved in a sting , but this time is was the thieves who managed to get away with thousands of stingers .

appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .

motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage .

still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .
it had to be fished out with a stomach tube that had small pincers on one end . however , it appears that the ring had nothing directly to do with the severe abdominal distress , according to police .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

" a new page in french history has been opened , " said the leader of the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- , which brings together socialist and social-democratic parties from across the continent . " in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .
" there is another france , which wants to turn the page , which wants to be more modern and european and less attached to a social and state model that multiplies injustices , rather than favoring equality . " la stampa pointed out that royal had appealed in particular to young french socialists .
" the internet generation ... have got rid of ' the elephants ' , the faded nobility .
it 's a revolution . " yet several papers also stressed that royal 's appeal appeared to be based more on image than on substance , and there was little agreement as to what she really stood for . " royal differentiates herself from her party colleagues with her radical - and not at all left-wing - views , " stated russian internet newspaper gazeta.ru . not so , said the times : " her campaign has resembled -lrb- britain 's -rrb- new labor only in its emphasis on moral values , deft use of the media and her ability to connect with the public .
on the economy and welfare state she remains firmly in the tradition of french orthodox socialism . " " she 's not a classic left-winger .
she 's seen as realistic .
she reminds one of her -lrb- expected right-wing -rrb- rival nicolas sarkozy for her ability to play in her adversaries ' court if need be , " observed kommersant in moscow . a new phase in french polutics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy shows his physical , but not metaphorical , hand " today is the start of a new phase in politics ...
nicolas sarkozy should make haste to show his hand , " italy 's repubblica advised the french interior minister , who is being held back by infighting in his party with outgoing president jacques chirac and his supporters . in the united states , the new york times said that " in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a french public yearning for a new style of leadership , " but stressed royal 's " inexperience in foreign policy issues . " the washington post said , " she capitalized on her image as a fresh-faced cyber-candidate running an insurgent 's campaign to shake up the stodgy male-dominated world of french politics .

" a new page in french history has been opened , " said the leader of the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- , which brings together socialist and social-democratic parties from across the continent . " in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .

still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .
it had to be fished out with a stomach tube that had small pincers on one end . however , it appears that the ring had nothing directly to do with the severe abdominal distress , according to police .

" in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .
" there is another france , which wants to turn the page , which wants to be more modern and european and less attached to a social and state model that multiplies injustices , rather than favoring equality . " la stampa pointed out that royal had appealed in particular to young french socialists .
" the internet generation ... have got rid of ' the elephants ' , the faded nobility .
it 's a revolution . " yet several papers also stressed that royal 's appeal appeared to be based more on image than on substance , and there was little agreement as to what she really stood for . " royal differentiates herself from her party colleagues with her radical - and not at all left-wing - views , " stated russian internet newspaper gazeta.ru . not so , said the times : " her campaign has resembled -lrb- britain 's -rrb- new labor only in its emphasis on moral values , deft use of the media and her ability to connect with the public .
on the economy and welfare state she remains firmly in the tradition of french orthodox socialism . " " she 's not a classic left-winger .
she 's seen as realistic .
she reminds one of her -lrb- expected right-wing -rrb- rival nicolas sarkozy for her ability to play in her adversaries ' court if need be , " observed kommersant in moscow . a new phase in french polutics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy shows his physical , but not metaphorical , hand " today is the start of a new phase in politics ...
nicolas sarkozy should make haste to show his hand , " italy 's repubblica advised the french interior minister , who is being held back by infighting in his party with outgoing president jacques chirac and his supporters . in the united states , the new york times said that " in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a french public yearning for a new style of leadership , " but stressed royal 's " inexperience in foreign policy issues . " the washington post said , " she capitalized on her image as a fresh-faced cyber-candidate running an insurgent 's campaign to shake up the stodgy male-dominated world of french politics .

11 suspect back to prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq left his apartment in hamburg on friday escorted by police german police detained convicted terrorist mounir el motassadeq , 32 , in hamburg friday when judges cancelled his bail , one day after he was found guilty of assisting the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . motassadeq , a moroccan student , had been free on bail but under police monitoring since february as the german courts reviewed his case .
he had been given seven years in jail last year for being a member of the hamburg terrorist cell that produced three of the sept .
11 pilots . on thursday , german high court judges added a second conviction as an accessory to the murder of 246 occupants of the hijacked planes that crashed in new york , washington , dc and pennsylvania . on friday , a german federal court ordered the moroccan be returned to prison while awaiting sentencing , overturning a lower court decision . rivalries between german federal and state courts were evident friday as state judges in the northern city of hamburg refused to order motassadeq be put in jail .
it was a federal court in kalsruhe ordered he be remanded to police custody . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 in new york " he was picked up at his hamburg apartment without any difficulty , " a police source in hamburg told the dpa news agency .
motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage . " two panels of hamburg judges had earlier said motassadeq could be trusted because he had always observed bail conditions in the past .
his lawyer , ladislav anicic , told the website spiegel online that his client had no intention of running away . as a close friend of mohammed atta and other pilots and a graduate of an al qaeda afghan training camp , he was convicted last year of membership in a terrorist cell .
on thursday he was found guilty of an actual role in 9/11 because he also covered the plotters ' tracks . a date has not yet been set for sentencing .
appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .
" so long as he is alive , our client wants to fight for people to believe him .

the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .
it had to be fished out with a stomach tube that had small pincers on one end . however , it appears that the ring had nothing directly to do with the severe abdominal distress , according to police .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .

that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .

that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .

11 suspect back to prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq left his apartment in hamburg on friday escorted by police german police detained convicted terrorist mounir el motassadeq , 32 , in hamburg friday when judges cancelled his bail , one day after he was found guilty of assisting the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . motassadeq , a moroccan student , had been free on bail but under police monitoring since february as the german courts reviewed his case .
he had been given seven years in jail last year for being a member of the hamburg terrorist cell that produced three of the sept .
11 pilots . on thursday , german high court judges added a second conviction as an accessory to the murder of 246 occupants of the hijacked planes that crashed in new york , washington , dc and pennsylvania . on friday , a german federal court ordered the moroccan be returned to prison while awaiting sentencing , overturning a lower court decision . rivalries between german federal and state courts were evident friday as state judges in the northern city of hamburg refused to order motassadeq be put in jail .
it was a federal court in kalsruhe ordered he be remanded to police custody . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 in new york " he was picked up at his hamburg apartment without any difficulty , " a police source in hamburg told the dpa news agency .
motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage . " two panels of hamburg judges had earlier said motassadeq could be trusted because he had always observed bail conditions in the past .
his lawyer , ladislav anicic , told the website spiegel online that his client had no intention of running away . as a close friend of mohammed atta and other pilots and a graduate of an al qaeda afghan training camp , he was convicted last year of membership in a terrorist cell .
on thursday he was found guilty of an actual role in 9/11 because he also covered the plotters ' tracks . a date has not yet been set for sentencing .
appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .
" so long as he is alive , our client wants to fight for people to believe him .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .

instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

11 suspect back to prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq left his apartment in hamburg on friday escorted by police german police detained convicted terrorist mounir el motassadeq , 32 , in hamburg friday when judges cancelled his bail , one day after he was found guilty of assisting the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . motassadeq , a moroccan student , had been free on bail but under police monitoring since february as the german courts reviewed his case .
he had been given seven years in jail last year for being a member of the hamburg terrorist cell that produced three of the sept .
11 pilots . on thursday , german high court judges added a second conviction as an accessory to the murder of 246 occupants of the hijacked planes that crashed in new york , washington , dc and pennsylvania . on friday , a german federal court ordered the moroccan be returned to prison while awaiting sentencing , overturning a lower court decision . rivalries between german federal and state courts were evident friday as state judges in the northern city of hamburg refused to order motassadeq be put in jail .

11 , 2001 in new york " he was picked up at his hamburg apartment without any difficulty , " a police source in hamburg told the dpa news agency .
motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage . " two panels of hamburg judges had earlier said motassadeq could be trusted because he had always observed bail conditions in the past .
his lawyer , ladislav anicic , told the website spiegel online that his client had no intention of running away . as a close friend of mohammed atta and other pilots and a graduate of an al qaeda afghan training camp , he was convicted last year of membership in a terrorist cell .
on thursday he was found guilty of an actual role in 9/11 because he also covered the plotters ' tracks . a date has not yet been set for sentencing .
appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .
" so long as he is alive , our client wants to fight for people to believe him .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?

still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .
it had to be fished out with a stomach tube that had small pincers on one end . however , it appears that the ring had nothing directly to do with the severe abdominal distress , according to police .

motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage .

his lawyer , ladislav anicic , told the website spiegel online that his client had no intention of running away . as a close friend of mohammed atta and other pilots and a graduate of an al qaeda afghan training camp , he was convicted last year of membership in a terrorist cell .

appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .
he said the defense will charge that the conviction contravenes germany 's basic law , but added that defense attorneys had yet to decide how they will argue the case . " we are looking at that now , " anisic said in a telephone interview .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

" a new page in french history has been opened , " said the leader of the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- , which brings together socialist and social-democratic parties from across the continent . " in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .
" there is another france , which wants to turn the page , which wants to be more modern and european and less attached to a social and state model that multiplies injustices , rather than favoring equality . " la stampa pointed out that royal had appealed in particular to young french socialists .
" the internet generation ... have got rid of ' the elephants ' , the faded nobility .
it 's a revolution . " yet several papers also stressed that royal 's appeal appeared to be based more on image than on substance , and there was little agreement as to what she really stood for . " royal differentiates herself from her party colleagues with her radical - and not at all left-wing - views , " stated russian internet newspaper gazeta.ru . not so , said the times : " her campaign has resembled -lrb- britain 's -rrb- new labor only in its emphasis on moral values , deft use of the media and her ability to connect with the public .
on the economy and welfare state she remains firmly in the tradition of french orthodox socialism . " " she 's not a classic left-winger .
she 's seen as realistic .
she reminds one of her -lrb- expected right-wing -rrb- rival nicolas sarkozy for her ability to play in her adversaries ' court if need be , " observed kommersant in moscow . a new phase in french polutics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy shows his physical , but not metaphorical , hand " today is the start of a new phase in politics ...
nicolas sarkozy should make haste to show his hand , " italy 's repubblica advised the french interior minister , who is being held back by infighting in his party with outgoing president jacques chirac and his supporters . in the united states , the new york times said that " in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a french public yearning for a new style of leadership , " but stressed royal 's " inexperience in foreign policy issues . " the washington post said , " she capitalized on her image as a fresh-faced cyber-candidate running an insurgent 's campaign to shake up the stodgy male-dominated world of french politics .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

but the financing of the a350 could exacerbate tensions between the us and the eu . the cost of launching the a350 , a long-haul mid-sized plane with seating for 270 to 350 passengers , has been estimated by european aircraft maker airbus at eight to nine billion euros -lrb- $ 10 to 12 billion -rrb- . airbus has been struggling to overcome costly production delays to its a380 super-jumbo program , which is now running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois became the airbus chief in october airbus chief executive louis gallois , after a meeting at the company 's headquarters in toulouse , said a decision about the a350 would be made " before the end of november . " " we can not launch a new program if we are not sure of being in a competitive situation , " he said . airbus and boeing in on-going conflict funding for the a350 poses a dilemma for the european company and the issue has the potential to intensify trade tensions between the united states and the european union . airbus is able to call on loans from european governments to cover part of the development costs of the aircraft , but the arrangement is at the center of a long-standing dispute at the world trade organization . the us is set to file a revised complaint this week at the world trade organization in geneva , charging that the preferential loans available from the french , german , british , and spanish governments to fund up to one-third of new airbus aircraft amount to illegal state aid under wto rules . for its part , the european union claims that boeing benefits from illegal state aid through space and defense contracts from the us government .
france to bail out subcontractors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in toulouse is facing further cost cutting on tuesday , france announced the release about 145 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- in 2007 and 2008 for the aeronautics sector in order to help airbus subcontractors . speaking in toulouse , french prime minister dominique de villepin said the government would provide 40 million euros in 2007 and the same amount in 2008 in reimbursable advances to airbus subcontractors who have been hurt by delays to the a380 project . the rest of the funding would be allocated to step up research and development in the aeronautics sector , he said . a380 on test-flight meanwhile , an airbus a380 super-jumbo has arrived in south korea on the second stop in a series of test flights before the aircraft goes into service as the world 's largest passenger plane . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new a380 is on an 18-day test flight the visit to seoul is part of an 18-day trip to 10 different airports to test operations before it seeks an airworthiness certificate by mid-december from european and us aviation safety authorities . the double-deck plane with a capacity of 840 passengers suffered a setback this month when us company fedex canceled orders for 10 aircraft following repeated delivery delays . airbus has secured orders for 149 super-jumbos , including five from korean air . airbus has had a calamitous year in 2006 , notable for management upheaval at the top of the company and repeated profit warnings because of delays to deliveries of the a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fedex 's nixed airbus order sends parent eads into tailspin a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .

" a new page in french history has been opened , " said the leader of the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- , which brings together socialist and social-democratic parties from across the continent . " in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .
" there is another france , which wants to turn the page , which wants to be more modern and european and less attached to a social and state model that multiplies injustices , rather than favoring equality . " la stampa pointed out that royal had appealed in particular to young french socialists .
" the internet generation ... have got rid of ' the elephants ' , the faded nobility .
it 's a revolution . " yet several papers also stressed that royal 's appeal appeared to be based more on image than on substance , and there was little agreement as to what she really stood for . " royal differentiates herself from her party colleagues with her radical - and not at all left-wing - views , " stated russian internet newspaper gazeta.ru . not so , said the times : " her campaign has resembled -lrb- britain 's -rrb- new labor only in its emphasis on moral values , deft use of the media and her ability to connect with the public .
on the economy and welfare state she remains firmly in the tradition of french orthodox socialism . " " she 's not a classic left-winger .
she 's seen as realistic .
she reminds one of her -lrb- expected right-wing -rrb- rival nicolas sarkozy for her ability to play in her adversaries ' court if need be , " observed kommersant in moscow . a new phase in french polutics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy shows his physical , but not metaphorical , hand " today is the start of a new phase in politics ...
nicolas sarkozy should make haste to show his hand , " italy 's repubblica advised the french interior minister , who is being held back by infighting in his party with outgoing president jacques chirac and his supporters . in the united states , the new york times said that " in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a french public yearning for a new style of leadership , " but stressed royal 's " inexperience in foreign policy issues . " the washington post said , " she capitalized on her image as a fresh-faced cyber-candidate running an insurgent 's campaign to shake up the stodgy male-dominated world of french politics .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

but has the ease with which people can consume cheap alcohol created a harmful drinking culture ? germany is one of the heaviest alcohol-drinking nations in europe , placed fifth after luxembourg , hungary , czech republic and ireland .
only around five percent of germans consider themselves teetotalers , making it - after luxembourg - the european country with the lowest percentage of people who abstain from drinking . according to the world health organization the european region has the highest alcohol intake of all other regions in the world and per capita consumption twice as high as the world average . " biggest social problem " alcoholism is a significant problem in germany , according to peter lang , head of drug prevention and abuse at the german center for health education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcohol abuse is considered one of the biggest social problems in germany " it 's difficult to say what is causing this , because alcohol is more or less an accepted drug in a lot of circumstances , like for parties or other social occasions , " lang said . " if you compare germany to countries like the us , there is drinking in public that is different and more accepted .
consuming alcohol during the day is really more accepted here in germany , " he added . most recent data shows that that 1.7 million germans are dependent on alcohol and need treatment , whilst , 2.7 million use alcohol in a harmful way . compared to the us , the most recent annual data from 2001-2002 shows that of a population of nearly 300 million , there are 7.91 million people dependent on alcohol . " german society as a whole does n't have a positive image of excessive drinking , but in general , awareness of the dangers of excessive consumption is growing , " said gabriele barsch of the german center for addiction issues . " the per capita consumption of pure alcohol in germany has been regressive for about six years , and fatalities caused by alcohol related accidents has halved since 1995 , " barsch said . " but for young people drinking alcohol is part of their lifestyle , particularly on weekends and parties , " she added .
alcohol is consumed " too thoughtlessly and too carelessly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking , but not alcohol abuse has a ' positive image ' in germany mark , who did not want his last name mentioned , is an american who is the coordinator for the english-speaking alcoholics anonymous in germany .
he has noticed that german culture is more accepting of alcohol use . " however , it seems just as socially unacceptable to drink large quantities and let your drinking get out of control here as in other societies , " mark said . " a common misperception , both in germany and the us , is that if you only drink beer or wine , you can not be an alcoholic , " he said .
" this seems to be an even more prevalent attitude here in germany . " is 16 years too young ? the legal drinking age in germany is 16 , though kids must wait until they 're 18 to drink spirits .
that five-year difference to the us , where the drinking age is 21 , appears to be significant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drinking age of 16 is one of the youngest legal drinking ages " if you drink especially when you are under 18 , it can cause massive damage as there is still brain development happening in these years , " lang said .
" but to change the law to 18 , this can not be done without health awareness campaigns . " barsch said she would like to see the minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol increased to 18 . " but we are aware that you can not reduce the harm done by alcohol by only introducing one new measure or law , " she said .
" what we need is a comprehensive approach of the problem . " drink anywhere , anytime in germany , alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores , gas stations and even newspaper stands .
it can be consumed in restaurants , cafes and snack bars , and it 's not uncommon to see people drinking in parks , on the streets and even on public transport . drinking in public so openly is a phenomenon that only began about five years ago , according to lang .
he posited that the development might have had to with the increased popularity of alcopops , alcohol mixed with soda designed to appeal to young consumers .
but they do n't stop at that . " at the moment you see younger and younger people drinking beer , which is becoming more accepted , " he added . beer is as cheap as water in germany , the price of alcohol in relation to the general costs of living is among the lowest in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the cheap price of alcohol contribute to drinking problems ? barsch said alcohol is too cheap in germany .
she pointed out that when a tax was imposed on the sale of alcopops , consumption fell significantly . " germany as a wine producing country and with a long beer-tradition as well , certainly runs a high risk of alcohol related problems , " barsch said . " -lrb- however -rrb- there is a lack of information on how harmful alcohol consumption is , and action to turn around the social norms where alcohol is accepted , " she added . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to do more to protect young people from alcohol european union countries were urged on tuesday to do more to protect young people from the dangers of drinking too much alcohol , which is linked to a quarter of the deaths of young men in the bloc .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?

" retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

11 suspect back to prison großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mounir el motassadeq left his apartment in hamburg on friday escorted by police german police detained convicted terrorist mounir el motassadeq , 32 , in hamburg friday when judges cancelled his bail , one day after he was found guilty of assisting the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states . motassadeq , a moroccan student , had been free on bail but under police monitoring since february as the german courts reviewed his case .
he had been given seven years in jail last year for being a member of the hamburg terrorist cell that produced three of the sept .
11 pilots . on thursday , german high court judges added a second conviction as an accessory to the murder of 246 occupants of the hijacked planes that crashed in new york , washington , dc and pennsylvania . on friday , a german federal court ordered the moroccan be returned to prison while awaiting sentencing , overturning a lower court decision . rivalries between german federal and state courts were evident friday as state judges in the northern city of hamburg refused to order motassadeq be put in jail .
it was a federal court in kalsruhe ordered he be remanded to police custody . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 in new york " he was picked up at his hamburg apartment without any difficulty , " a police source in hamburg told the dpa news agency .
motassadeq , 32 , has been in and out of hamburg jails since he was first detained the month after the 2001 attacks , when he claimed he had no foreknowledge of the strikes . flight risk judges in karlsruhe said the fact that motassadeq 's family had left germany for morocco created an increased risk that he would try to flee before a sentencing hearing that was likely to be " to his disadvantage . " two panels of hamburg judges had earlier said motassadeq could be trusted because he had always observed bail conditions in the past .
his lawyer , ladislav anicic , told the website spiegel online that his client had no intention of running away . as a close friend of mohammed atta and other pilots and a graduate of an al qaeda afghan training camp , he was convicted last year of membership in a terrorist cell .
on thursday he was found guilty of an actual role in 9/11 because he also covered the plotters ' tracks . a date has not yet been set for sentencing .
appeal defense attorney anisic on sunday said motassadeq will appeal to germany 's highest court against his conviction . the lawyer said that the 32-year-old will take his case to germany 's federal constitutional court .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

still , suspicions were raised when upon questioning , the man almost doubled over from pain . " he said he 'd grabbed the box and found it empty , but the shopkeeper said there was a ring missing , " the spokesperson told reuters .
" then during questioning he complained of severe stomach pains and was rushed to the hospital with suspected appendicitis . " doctors x-rayed the patient in pain and discovered the ring in his stomach .

" a new page in french history has been opened , " said the leader of the party of european socialists -lrb- pes -rrb- , which brings together socialist and social-democratic parties from across the continent . " in choosing a resolute and visionary woman , the members of the parti socialiste have chosen for france a candidate for the future and have given themselves every chance of beating the right in 2007 , " pes leader poul nyrup rasmussen said .
" segolene ... will enable france to regain its natural place as a great progressive nation in europe and the world . " royal , a telegenic career politician who has built an image as a party outsider infused with fresh ideas , won 60.6 percent of the vote in the socialist primary on thursday , trouncing two older male rivals who have already served in government . a much-needed new dimension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has been described as committed and dynamic " this is very exciting ...
it introduces a new dimension in french politics , which is much needed , " norwegian foreign minister jonas gahr stoere told afp . kurt beck , leader of the german social democrats , described royal as " committed and courageous " and predicted her " dynamism " would help her party to election victory . several major papers in europe concurred . " the day makes history for two reasons , " charles bremner of britain 's times newspaper wrote in his weblog .
" for the first time , a woman has become a front-line candidate for the french presidency , a monarchical , patriarchal , institution that was tailor-made for charles de gaulle in the late 1950s .
french presidents are supposed to be elderly men of destiny , good at grandeur , not a youngish woman with television charisma but no clear vision . " " the other novelty is the way that royal , 53 , has emerged as a relative outsider and hijacked the country 's most tradition-bound party , " the weblog continued . modern france wants to turn the page bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal could rid france of its " faded nobility " italy 's corriere della serra agreed .
" there is another france , which wants to turn the page , which wants to be more modern and european and less attached to a social and state model that multiplies injustices , rather than favoring equality . " la stampa pointed out that royal had appealed in particular to young french socialists .
" the internet generation ... have got rid of ' the elephants ' , the faded nobility .
it 's a revolution . " yet several papers also stressed that royal 's appeal appeared to be based more on image than on substance , and there was little agreement as to what she really stood for . " royal differentiates herself from her party colleagues with her radical - and not at all left-wing - views , " stated russian internet newspaper gazeta.ru . not so , said the times : " her campaign has resembled -lrb- britain 's -rrb- new labor only in its emphasis on moral values , deft use of the media and her ability to connect with the public .
on the economy and welfare state she remains firmly in the tradition of french orthodox socialism . " " she 's not a classic left-winger .
she 's seen as realistic .
she reminds one of her -lrb- expected right-wing -rrb- rival nicolas sarkozy for her ability to play in her adversaries ' court if need be , " observed kommersant in moscow . a new phase in french polutics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy shows his physical , but not metaphorical , hand " today is the start of a new phase in politics ...
nicolas sarkozy should make haste to show his hand , " italy 's repubblica advised the french interior minister , who is being held back by infighting in his party with outgoing president jacques chirac and his supporters . in the united states , the new york times said that " in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a french public yearning for a new style of leadership , " but stressed royal 's " inexperience in foreign policy issues . " the washington post said , " she capitalized on her image as a fresh-faced cyber-candidate running an insurgent 's campaign to shake up the stodgy male-dominated world of french politics .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 18.11.2006 the highs and lows of germany 's drinking culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is famous for its beer drinking , at events like oktoberfest in germany , beer is about the same price as water , and drinking alcohol in public is common as well as legal .
but has the ease with which people can consume cheap alcohol created a harmful drinking culture ? germany is one of the heaviest alcohol-drinking nations in europe , placed fifth after luxembourg , hungary , czech republic and ireland .
only around five percent of germans consider themselves teetotalers , making it - after luxembourg - the european country with the lowest percentage of people who abstain from drinking . according to the world health organization the european region has the highest alcohol intake of all other regions in the world and per capita consumption twice as high as the world average . " biggest social problem " alcoholism is a significant problem in germany , according to peter lang , head of drug prevention and abuse at the german center for health education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcohol abuse is considered one of the biggest social problems in germany " it 's difficult to say what is causing this , because alcohol is more or less an accepted drug in a lot of circumstances , like for parties or other social occasions , " lang said . " if you compare germany to countries like the us , there is drinking in public that is different and more accepted .
consuming alcohol during the day is really more accepted here in germany , " he added . most recent data shows that that 1.7 million germans are dependent on alcohol and need treatment , whilst , 2.7 million use alcohol in a harmful way . compared to the us , the most recent annual data from 2001-2002 shows that of a population of nearly 300 million , there are 7.91 million people dependent on alcohol . " german society as a whole does n't have a positive image of excessive drinking , but in general , awareness of the dangers of excessive consumption is growing , " said gabriele barsch of the german center for addiction issues . " the per capita consumption of pure alcohol in germany has been regressive for about six years , and fatalities caused by alcohol related accidents has halved since 1995 , " barsch said . " but for young people drinking alcohol is part of their lifestyle , particularly on weekends and parties , " she added .
alcohol is consumed " too thoughtlessly and too carelessly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking , but not alcohol abuse has a ' positive image ' in germany mark , who did not want his last name mentioned , is an american who is the coordinator for the english-speaking alcoholics anonymous in germany .
he has noticed that german culture is more accepting of alcohol use . " however , it seems just as socially unacceptable to drink large quantities and let your drinking get out of control here as in other societies , " mark said . " a common misperception , both in germany and the us , is that if you only drink beer or wine , you can not be an alcoholic , " he said .
" this seems to be an even more prevalent attitude here in germany . " is 16 years too young ? the legal drinking age in germany is 16 , though kids must wait until they 're 18 to drink spirits .
that five-year difference to the us , where the drinking age is 21 , appears to be significant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drinking age of 16 is one of the youngest legal drinking ages " if you drink especially when you are under 18 , it can cause massive damage as there is still brain development happening in these years , " lang said .
" but to change the law to 18 , this can not be done without health awareness campaigns . " barsch said she would like to see the minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol increased to 18 . " but we are aware that you can not reduce the harm done by alcohol by only introducing one new measure or law , " she said .
" what we need is a comprehensive approach of the problem . " drink anywhere , anytime in germany , alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores , gas stations and even newspaper stands .
it can be consumed in restaurants , cafes and snack bars , and it 's not uncommon to see people drinking in parks , on the streets and even on public transport . drinking in public so openly is a phenomenon that only began about five years ago , according to lang .
he posited that the development might have had to with the increased popularity of alcopops , alcohol mixed with soda designed to appeal to young consumers .
but they do n't stop at that . " at the moment you see younger and younger people drinking beer , which is becoming more accepted , " he added . beer is as cheap as water in germany , the price of alcohol in relation to the general costs of living is among the lowest in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the cheap price of alcohol contribute to drinking problems ? barsch said alcohol is too cheap in germany .
she pointed out that when a tax was imposed on the sale of alcopops , consumption fell significantly . " germany as a wine producing country and with a long beer-tradition as well , certainly runs a high risk of alcohol related problems , " barsch said . " -lrb- however -rrb- there is a lack of information on how harmful alcohol consumption is , and action to turn around the social norms where alcohol is accepted , " she added . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to do more to protect young people from alcohol european union countries were urged on tuesday to do more to protect young people from the dangers of drinking too much alcohol , which is linked to a quarter of the deaths of young men in the bloc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 18.11.2006 the highs and lows of germany 's drinking culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is famous for its beer drinking , at events like oktoberfest in germany , beer is about the same price as water , and drinking alcohol in public is common as well as legal .
but has the ease with which people can consume cheap alcohol created a harmful drinking culture ? germany is one of the heaviest alcohol-drinking nations in europe , placed fifth after luxembourg , hungary , czech republic and ireland .
only around five percent of germans consider themselves teetotalers , making it - after luxembourg - the european country with the lowest percentage of people who abstain from drinking . according to the world health organization the european region has the highest alcohol intake of all other regions in the world and per capita consumption twice as high as the world average . " biggest social problem " alcoholism is a significant problem in germany , according to peter lang , head of drug prevention and abuse at the german center for health education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcohol abuse is considered one of the biggest social problems in germany " it 's difficult to say what is causing this , because alcohol is more or less an accepted drug in a lot of circumstances , like for parties or other social occasions , " lang said . " if you compare germany to countries like the us , there is drinking in public that is different and more accepted .
consuming alcohol during the day is really more accepted here in germany , " he added . most recent data shows that that 1.7 million germans are dependent on alcohol and need treatment , whilst , 2.7 million use alcohol in a harmful way . compared to the us , the most recent annual data from 2001-2002 shows that of a population of nearly 300 million , there are 7.91 million people dependent on alcohol . " german society as a whole does n't have a positive image of excessive drinking , but in general , awareness of the dangers of excessive consumption is growing , " said gabriele barsch of the german center for addiction issues . " the per capita consumption of pure alcohol in germany has been regressive for about six years , and fatalities caused by alcohol related accidents has halved since 1995 , " barsch said . " but for young people drinking alcohol is part of their lifestyle , particularly on weekends and parties , " she added .
alcohol is consumed " too thoughtlessly and too carelessly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drinking , but not alcohol abuse has a ' positive image ' in germany mark , who did not want his last name mentioned , is an american who is the coordinator for the english-speaking alcoholics anonymous in germany .
he has noticed that german culture is more accepting of alcohol use . " however , it seems just as socially unacceptable to drink large quantities and let your drinking get out of control here as in other societies , " mark said . " a common misperception , both in germany and the us , is that if you only drink beer or wine , you can not be an alcoholic , " he said .
" this seems to be an even more prevalent attitude here in germany . " is 16 years too young ? the legal drinking age in germany is 16 , though kids must wait until they 're 18 to drink spirits .
that five-year difference to the us , where the drinking age is 21 , appears to be significant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drinking age of 16 is one of the youngest legal drinking ages " if you drink especially when you are under 18 , it can cause massive damage as there is still brain development happening in these years , " lang said .
" but to change the law to 18 , this can not be done without health awareness campaigns . " barsch said she would like to see the minimum age for buying and consuming alcohol increased to 18 . " but we are aware that you can not reduce the harm done by alcohol by only introducing one new measure or law , " she said .
" what we need is a comprehensive approach of the problem . " drink anywhere , anytime in germany , alcohol can be purchased in grocery stores , gas stations and even newspaper stands .
it can be consumed in restaurants , cafes and snack bars , and it 's not uncommon to see people drinking in parks , on the streets and even on public transport . drinking in public so openly is a phenomenon that only began about five years ago , according to lang .
he posited that the development might have had to with the increased popularity of alcopops , alcohol mixed with soda designed to appeal to young consumers .
but they do n't stop at that . " at the moment you see younger and younger people drinking beer , which is becoming more accepted , " he added . beer is as cheap as water in germany , the price of alcohol in relation to the general costs of living is among the lowest in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does the cheap price of alcohol contribute to drinking problems ? barsch said alcohol is too cheap in germany .
she pointed out that when a tax was imposed on the sale of alcopops , consumption fell significantly . " germany as a wine producing country and with a long beer-tradition as well , certainly runs a high risk of alcohol related problems , " barsch said . " -lrb- however -rrb- there is a lack of information on how harmful alcohol consumption is , and action to turn around the social norms where alcohol is accepted , " she added . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urged to do more to protect young people from alcohol european union countries were urged on tuesday to do more to protect young people from the dangers of drinking too much alcohol , which is linked to a quarter of the deaths of young men in the bloc .

but the financing of the a350 could exacerbate tensions between the us and the eu . the cost of launching the a350 , a long-haul mid-sized plane with seating for 270 to 350 passengers , has been estimated by european aircraft maker airbus at eight to nine billion euros -lrb- $ 10 to 12 billion -rrb- . airbus has been struggling to overcome costly production delays to its a380 super-jumbo program , which is now running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois became the airbus chief in october airbus chief executive louis gallois , after a meeting at the company 's headquarters in toulouse , said a decision about the a350 would be made " before the end of november . " " we can not launch a new program if we are not sure of being in a competitive situation , " he said . airbus and boeing in on-going conflict funding for the a350 poses a dilemma for the european company and the issue has the potential to intensify trade tensions between the united states and the european union . airbus is able to call on loans from european governments to cover part of the development costs of the aircraft , but the arrangement is at the center of a long-standing dispute at the world trade organization . the us is set to file a revised complaint this week at the world trade organization in geneva , charging that the preferential loans available from the french , german , british , and spanish governments to fund up to one-third of new airbus aircraft amount to illegal state aid under wto rules . for its part , the european union claims that boeing benefits from illegal state aid through space and defense contracts from the us government .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 18.11.2006 peace prize awarded for children 's book on racism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the power of the book lies in its being black and white , said the jury .
dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .
instead he lets the readers interpret the text for themselves . at the end of the story , maria sells koko and moves away to a good boarding school . " the adults said what kind of ending is that ?
but the kids said , no , that 's really nice .
she goes to another environment and perhaps without the slave she can form a different opinion and that 's good , " said verroen . fabian gartmann -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former chancellor to oversee anti-racism group former chancellor gerhard schröder made a rare public appearance this week to announce that he 's taking over the reins of an anti-racism group that fights xenophobia and anti-semitism .

dutch author dolf verroen received the gustav heinemann peace prize in essen this week for his children 's book told from the perspective of a white slave owner . the narrator 's point of view makes the inhumane treatment of the slaves seem completely banal , which gives the book a provocative force , said the jury about dolf verroen 's book " wie schön weiß ich bin " -lrb- " how nice and white i am " -rrb- . " in this case we have a book that is convincing not by its colorfulness , but by being black-and-white , " said jury chairman fabian gartmann . verroen tells his tale through the eyes of a plantation owner 's daughter , maria , who is given a slave for her twelfth birthday .
for spoiled maria , koko is a worthless object .
he does n't even see himself as human because he 's not treated as one . maria quickly becomes bored with her slave . " children can understand it " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these boys were sold by a slave trader in sudan to a charity representative in 1997 .
" she asks , ' where do you come from ? ' and he answers , ' from the market , miss , ' and then she says he 's so dumb .
that 's so telling , " said the book 's translator rolf erdorf , " he 's like a potato from the weekly market and i think that children can understand that very well . " maria takes advantage of having a personal slave to act out the behavior she sees in the adults around her .
she can exercise authority just like the grown-ups . like koko , children are also stuck in hierarchical structures they ca n't change and often feel powerless , said erdorf . " these are the structures that distort everything .
this book shows normality but also shows just how distorted and revolting that normality is , " added the translator . childhood woes the inspiration behind verroen 's story , told in 40 short episodes , was his own travels to surinam and ghana .
he saw people working there in slave-like conditions and decided to raise awareness by writing a book about it . twelve-year-old maria is not portrayed as the bad guy .
she simply does n't know anything else .
for her , being friendly to a slave would be a serious social faux pas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children can relate to the girl 's own insecurities , said the author " the girl is wrapped up in herself , " said verroen .
" she 's 12 , she does n't have any breasts , she detests herself and when she looks at the slave she says to herself , ' oh how nice and white i am ' . " ending gets mixed response the author does n't offer any clever advice or lesson .

but has the ease with which people can consume cheap alcohol created a harmful drinking culture ? germany is one of the heaviest alcohol-drinking nations in europe , placed fifth after luxembourg , hungary , czech republic and ireland .
only around five percent of germans consider themselves teetotalers , making it - after luxembourg - the european country with the lowest percentage of people who abstain from drinking . according to the world health organization the european region has the highest alcohol intake of all other regions in the world and per capita consumption twice as high as the world average . " biggest social problem " alcoholism is a significant problem in germany , according to peter lang , head of drug prevention and abuse at the german center for health education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alcohol abuse is considered one of the biggest social problems in germany " it 's difficult to say what is causing this , because alcohol is more or less an accepted drug in a lot of circumstances , like for parties or other social occasions , " lang said .

the densely populated western state follows the lead of the berlin state legislature last week , which in addition to the monday through saturday 24 hour rule , will stores to be open on sundays ten days a year . this past summer , germany 's unpopular ladenschlussgesetz or store closing law was scrapped in a move to shift federal power to germany 's sixteen states , several which have been expected to expand their store opening hours regulations , which used to be among the most restrictive in europe . europe 's most deregulated shopping legislation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shop until you drop ?
the economically depressed eastern states of saxony-anhalt and mecklenburg-western pomerania are also expected to completely deregulate shopping hours six days a week , while retailers in the state of rhineland-palatinate , which borders on france , will be permitted to remain open until 10 pm during the week . up until now , the fifty-year-old ladenschlussgesetz , which has undergone numerous reforms over the last 17 years , mandates stores can be open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays , and imposes a general ban on sunday opening .
exceptions include florists in the vicinity of hospitals and shops at airports and railway stations . before 1989 , stores were only allowed to open until 6:30 p.m. on weekdays and 2:00 p.m. on saturdays , with many smaller general stores closing even earlier . unions and churches critical of extended shopping hours the law was deeply unpopular with german consumers , but defended by unions , which argued that longer hours did not necessarily contribute to higher revenues and that they posed a threat to smaller family-owned shops , which could not compete with the longer opening hours and resources of large department stores and supermarket chains . the churches have also been strong critics of store hours liberalization and in particular of sunday trading as interfering with family life and promoting excessive consumption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mega-media store in berlin plans to experiment with all night shopping on fridays wolfgang huber , spokesman for the protestant church , said " can you imagine an entire month without a single shopping-free sunday ?
that means protection of our sundays and holidays , which are supposed to be guaranteed by our constitution , has completely fallen away . " retailers say that liberal state laws simply give them the latitude to set their own hours , but how long they decide to remain open would depend on public demand for extended hours . larger chains in central locations , such as c & a at the heart of berlin 's alexanderplatz plan to open late on weekdays and dussmann , the media department store on the central unter den linden boulevard plans to do business all night on fridays . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans hit stores ahead of sales tax jump four months before germans watch the value-added tax jump from 16 percent to 19 percent , many consumers are growing skeptical about the country 's economic prospects - but still shopping , according to a new study .

but the financing of the a350 could exacerbate tensions between the us and the eu . the cost of launching the a350 , a long-haul mid-sized plane with seating for 270 to 350 passengers , has been estimated by european aircraft maker airbus at eight to nine billion euros -lrb- $ 10 to 12 billion -rrb- . airbus has been struggling to overcome costly production delays to its a380 super-jumbo program , which is now running two years behind schedule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : louis gallois became the airbus chief in october airbus chief executive louis gallois , after a meeting at the company 's headquarters in toulouse , said a decision about the a350 would be made " before the end of november . " " we can not launch a new program if we are not sure of being in a competitive situation , " he said . airbus and boeing in on-going conflict funding for the a350 poses a dilemma for the european company and the issue has the potential to intensify trade tensions between the united states and the european union . airbus is able to call on loans from european governments to cover part of the development costs of the aircraft , but the arrangement is at the center of a long-standing dispute at the world trade organization . the us is set to file a revised complaint this week at the world trade organization in geneva , charging that the preferential loans available from the french , german , british , and spanish governments to fund up to one-third of new airbus aircraft amount to illegal state aid under wto rules . for its part , the european union claims that boeing benefits from illegal state aid through space and defense contracts from the us government .
france to bail out subcontractors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus plant in toulouse is facing further cost cutting on tuesday , france announced the release about 145 million euros -lrb- $ 185 million -rrb- in 2007 and 2008 for the aeronautics sector in order to help airbus subcontractors . speaking in toulouse , french prime minister dominique de villepin said the government would provide 40 million euros in 2007 and the same amount in 2008 in reimbursable advances to airbus subcontractors who have been hurt by delays to the a380 project . the rest of the funding would be allocated to step up research and development in the aeronautics sector , he said . a380 on test-flight meanwhile , an airbus a380 super-jumbo has arrived in south korea on the second stop in a series of test flights before the aircraft goes into service as the world 's largest passenger plane . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new a380 is on an 18-day test flight the visit to seoul is part of an 18-day trip to 10 different airports to test operations before it seeks an airworthiness certificate by mid-december from european and us aviation safety authorities . the double-deck plane with a capacity of 840 passengers suffered a setback this month when us company fedex canceled orders for 10 aircraft following repeated delivery delays . airbus has secured orders for 149 super-jumbos , including five from korean air . airbus has had a calamitous year in 2006 , notable for management upheaval at the top of the company and repeated profit warnings because of delays to deliveries of the a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : fedex 's nixed airbus order sends parent eads into tailspin a decision by us mail group fedex to cancel its order for 10 airbus a380 super-jumbo planes caused massive third-quarter losses at airbus parent eads .

dutch muslim groups say a ban would make the country 's one million muslims feel victimised and alienated .
the dutch cabinet said burqas - a full body covering that also obscures the face - disturb public order and safety .
the decision comes days ahead of elections which the ruling centre-right coalition is expected to win .
the proposed ban would apply to wearing the burqa in the street , and in trains , schools , buses and law courts in the netherlands .
other forms of face coverings , such as veils , and crash helmets with visors that obscure the face , would also be covered by a ban .
immigration minister rita verdonk , who is known for her tough policies , said it was important that all people in the netherlands were able to see and identify each other clearly to promote integration and tolerance .
last year a majority of mps in the dutch parliament said they were in favour of a ban .
an estimated 6 % of 16 million people living in the netherlands are muslims .
but there are thought to be fewer than 100 women who choose to wear the burqa , a traditional islamic form of dress .
civil rights debate the latest move came after an expert committee judged that it would not contravene dutch law .
-lsb- it is -rsb- undesirable that face-covering clothing is worn in public places for reasons of public order , security and protection of citizens rita verdonk the islamic veil in europe why women wear the veil send us your comments ms verdonk insisted the burqa was not an acceptable part of public life in the netherlands .
" the cabinet finds it undesirable that face-covering clothing - including the burqa - is worn in public places for reasons of public order , security and protection of citizens , " she said .
the minister told the bbc that social interaction would be easier if faces were not covered .
" it is very important that we can see each other and can communicate with each other .
because we are so tolerant we want to respect each other . "
critics of the proposed ban say it would violate civil rights .
the main muslim organisation in the netherlands , cmo , said the plan was an " over-reaction to a very marginal problem " , the associated press reported .
naima azough , an mp with the opposition green party who is also muslim , said the ban was not in keeping with the country 's history of tolerance and said the dutch government was playing on people 's fears of islamic extremism to win votes .
" it has to do with radicalisation , it has to do with fears and the absolute reality of radicalisation amongst muslim youngsters .
" the problem is only that you ca n't say that every person wearing a niqab or hijab or burqa - whatever you call it - is a radical , " she said .
the mayor of amsterdam , job cohen , said he opposed the wearing of burqas in public and said women wearing one who failed to get a job should not expect welfare benefits .
" from the perspective of integration and communication , it is obviously very bad because you ca n't see each other so the fewer the better .
" but actually hardly anybody wears one ...
the fuss is much bigger than the number of people concerned , " he said .
tension the issue of the type of clothing worn by muslim women has become a hotly-debated subject in a range of european countries .
france has passed a law banning religious symbols , including muslim headscarves , from schools .
find out about different styles of muslim headscarf in graphics some german states ban teachers in public schools from wearing headscarves , but there is no blanket rule against burqas .
italy has banned face-coverings , resurrecting old laws passed to combat domestic terrorism , while citing new security fears .
the issue of muslim women 's dress also surfaced in the uk , when former foreign secretary jack straw sparked controversy when he said he felt uncomfortable talking to someone whose face he could not see .
the dutch relationship with its muslim community has been under scrutiny since the murder of film-maker theo van gogh by islamic extremists in november 2004 .
earlier this year ms verdonk clashed with a minority party in the governing coalition over her handling of the citizenship case of somali-born dutch mp ayaan hirsi ali .
the mp scripted a controversial film about the treatment of women in islamic society , directed by van gogh before he was killed .
but she admitted lying on her 1992 application for dutch citizenship , and ms verdonk initially called for the mp to be deported .

dutch muslim groups say a ban would make the country 's one million muslims feel victimised and alienated .
the dutch cabinet said burqas - a full body covering that also obscures the face - disturb public order and safety .
the decision comes days ahead of elections which the ruling centre-right coalition is expected to win .
the proposed ban would apply to wearing the burqa in the street , and in trains , schools , buses and law courts in the netherlands .
other forms of face coverings , such as veils , and crash helmets with visors that obscure the face , would also be covered by a ban .
immigration minister rita verdonk , who is known for her tough policies , said it was important that all people in the netherlands were able to see and identify each other clearly to promote integration and tolerance .
last year a majority of mps in the dutch parliament said they were in favour of a ban .
an estimated 6 % of 16 million people living in the netherlands are muslims .
but there are thought to be fewer than 100 women who choose to wear the burqa , a traditional islamic form of dress .
civil rights debate the latest move came after an expert committee judged that it would not contravene dutch law .

the decision comes days ahead of elections which the ruling centre-right coalition is expected to win .
the proposed ban would apply to wearing the burqa in the street , and in trains , schools , buses and law courts in the netherlands .
other forms of face coverings , such as veils , and crash helmets with visors that obscure the face , would also be covered by a ban .
immigration minister rita verdonk , who is known for her tough policies , said it was important that all people in the netherlands were able to see and identify each other clearly to promote integration and tolerance .
last year a majority of mps in the dutch parliament said they were in favour of a ban .
an estimated 6 % of 16 million people living in the netherlands are muslims .
but there are thought to be fewer than 100 women who choose to wear the burqa , a traditional islamic form of dress .
civil rights debate the latest move came after an expert committee judged that it would not contravene dutch law .

" the cabinet finds it undesirable that face-covering clothing - including the burqa - is worn in public places for reasons of public order , security and protection of citizens , " she said .
the minister told the bbc that social interaction would be easier if faces were not covered .
" it is very important that we can see each other and can communicate with each other .
because we are so tolerant we want to respect each other . "
critics of the proposed ban say it would violate civil rights .
the main muslim organisation in the netherlands , cmo , said the plan was an " over-reaction to a very marginal problem " , the associated press reported .
naima azough , an mp with the opposition green party who is also muslim , said the ban was not in keeping with the country 's history of tolerance and said the dutch government was playing on people 's fears of islamic extremism to win votes .
" it has to do with radicalisation , it has to do with fears and the absolute reality of radicalisation amongst muslim youngsters .
" the problem is only that you ca n't say that every person wearing a niqab or hijab or burqa - whatever you call it - is a radical , " she said .
the mayor of amsterdam , job cohen , said he opposed the wearing of burqas in public and said women wearing one who failed to get a job should not expect welfare benefits .

bbc news - have your say : security lapses home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help bbc news channel news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog page last updated at 11:36 gmt , saturday , 18 november 2006 e-mail this to a friend printable version have your say : security lapses eleven million nationwide customers may have been put at risk of identity crime after an employee 's laptop was stolen .
the computer with customer information on it was stolen during a domestic burglary three months ago .
but details of the serious security lapse are only just emerging .
nationwide has apologised to customers and reassured them that they will not become identity-theft victims .
should financial firms be made to inform customers immediately after any security lapse ?
are you a nationwide customer ?
what do you think about the security lapse ?
read a selection of your comments below .
the theft of laptops , either from cars or properties , has been rife for several years now , so it seems rather irresponsible for such extensive customer information to be stored on one .
the nationwide has a lot of questions to answer and has let its members down badly in every respect .
roger drew , portsmouth as well as the potential for identity fraud , i 'm also very concerned about exactly what data was held on there .
it seems there may have been names and account numbers , but what about people 's credit ratings , current balance , and salary information ?
i would n't want all this information about me to be known publicly .
tim , norwich i have been with nationwide for almost 45 years , and have every faith in its security .
i also worked for 36 years in the it industry and believe that , based on its statements , it has done everything necessary to protect its customers .
this appears to be a media hype .
the media should be warning the public more about phishing which is more likely to be the way criminals will get any security data needed .
mike young , barnham no-one has yet asked the question , how many other nationwide employees are carrying their laptops around with them , potentially leaving them on buses or in taxis ?
i am a nationwide customer and am angry that this has been kept from me and that the boss of nationwide is hiding behind some police " advice " not to divulge some pretty basic facts , such as , are our names and addresses on that laptop ?
i 'm in two minds at the moment as to whether to pull my account .
mike , spalding i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts shashi g , loughborough i do not think this incident is as serious as the media makes it out to be .
if people read the statement given out by nationwide properly they say there is nothing to worry about .
i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts .
it is not fair to worry people for no reason .
think about the vulnerable people who are not likely to understand the situation and worry for no apparent reason .
i am a proud customer of nationwide and they have helped me out over the years so much when no other institution would .
shashi g , loughborough i am a nationwide customer and have always found them good .
but they should be made to advise customers immediately something like this happens so at least we change details or just be more vigilant with our accounts .
i 'm disgusted they deemed it a good idea to keep it under wraps .
at the end of the day it 's our money and financial security at risk - how dare they keep it quiet ?
a press release should have aired with in 24 hours .
paul pettifer , slough i have been a nationwide customer for what must be nearly 20 years .
in all that time the service has been excellent .
i am not worried about this hyped-up scare story .
joe lou , manchester we can hope that the data will never see the light of day - with the pc being recycled by the culprits .
if it does transpire that all this confidential data is in the hands of malicious thieves , then nationwide faces damage to its reputation of incalculable consequences .
mike forster , horsham there should be stricter rules on data protection malcolm gardner , shropshire i am a nationwide customer and feel i should have been informed a lot earlier .
there should be stricter rules on data protection and fines imposed when necessary .
malcolm gardner , shropshire i thought that your comments were foolish .
it seems at least possible that the thief felt he had just stolen a laptop .
the policy of first trying to ensure that potential harm is minimised , by replacing card numbers for example , seems exactly the correct one .
my security takes greater priority than your wish to publish .
otherwise , i have to say , you run a generally excellent programme .
neville cramer , cambridge the person who mentions that it 's all scaremongering has really lost the plot .
if they had their id stolen they would n't say that .
i also think that the person who took the laptop home and the person that authorised it -lrb- if someone had authorised it -rrb- should be dismissed immediately for gross negligence .
barbra smith , harrow i am surprised at the amount of people who do n't see this as an issue .
in it , we spend millions of pounds trying to stop people accessing personal data and here nationwide has handed it to someone on a plate .
you can not assume that it was merely " flogged for £ 20 in the pub " .
as someone with a daughter who has had her details stolen , the dismay , inconvenience , aggravation and tears that follow can not be trivialised .
i recommend that these people break out of their bubble and join me in the real world in 2006 !
pen the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure lucy bailey , hay-on-wye as a nationwide customer , i fully support its reasons -lrb- although not explicitly given -rrb- for not informing the public of the stolen laptop .
had the laptop been stolen from a branch , the situation might have been different -lrb- although the thief would have been on cctv -rrb- .
however , because it was an employee 's home , informing the public immediately would have certainly let the thief know the potential value of what they had stolen .
given the three month delay , it is more than likely that the laptop would have been wiped and sold on .
it 's all very well to say that wiped data can be retrieved , but if no-one knows it is there , who is going to want to retrieve it ?
the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure .
lucy bailey , hay-on-wye accounts seem to suggest that the taking of the laptop home was a breach of policy .
one would like to think that this would be an act of " gross misconduct " and the employee sacked .
the nationwide 's comments about the laptop being " password protected " are totally lame .
it is clear from his comments that encryption was not used .
nationwide claim that no customer has been or will be the victim of id fraud .
how does one prove that fraud was a result of data gained from the laptop - information may be of use with other organisations that have fewer security measures in place .
nationwide 's refusal to indicate exactly what data was stolen simply fosters the thought that rather more information was stolen than it is letting on - they are protecting themselves , not the customer .
andrew hana , bristol most thieves would n't guess who owned the laptop nor would they take the time to attempt to gain data from it .
if nationwide has been negligent enough to not encrypt its laptop drives then it should be reprimanded .
the data protection act states that every possible measure must be taken to secure important customer information .
mark d , london i am a nationwide fan and have been for over 10 years .
i have no problem with what i understand the situation to be at present and i am very content to leave it in the hands of those that know best as to the full extent of the issues - nationwide .
my anger is directed towards those that feel the need to break into property to steal from others .
nec , midlands events like this highlight the threat to innocent people in this electronic age .
it is naive to think that when we give our information to others it is completely secure .
it raises bigger questions that need to be addressed for example the government 's identity cards .
i 'm not against them in principle , but i disagree with government 's or other institutions holding my information on secure servers when this illustrates how easy it is to misplace the information .
jon , southampton this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight michael collett , france if the negligent employee really needed information about a customer or customers when away from his office , surely he could have downloaded that information from nationwide as and when he needed it , deleting it immediately after .
alternatively , he could have had the information on an external hard drive , other than with his laptop , but in an encrypted form .
this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight .
michael collett , france i am a relaxed nationwide customer john schultz , stockport i believe your programme is guilty of appallingly irresponsible scaremongering , and an outrageously unjustified accusation of indifference against nationwide .
every time i give someone a cheque , it reveals my name and account number .
and my address is in the phone book .
i use my e-mail address widely - i 've even given it to you below !
this is all readily available information about most people .
and how can you justify abusing your position by making a cheap jibe of indifference against those who merely follow police advice ?
i am a relaxed nationwide customer , am not an employee , and do n't know anybody who works for it .
john schultz , stockport thank you nationwide for not disclosing the theft quickly .
if they had the thief would have known the value of what he had and used it .
instead the thief almost certainly reformatted the disk to make it saleable .
david llewellyn , huddersfield i wo n't leave nationwide in regards to this incident .
nationwide has been so generous to me in several occasions .
i have been with them for the past seven years .
i will continue to be with them for the rest of my life .
i love my bank .
bashkim krasniqi , lewisham , london i take reasonable steps to protect my myself from identity theft .
i am therefore more than disappointed that nationwide may have compromised my efforts through a very basic data security failure .
it should be of great concern to customers that an error of judgement as fundamental as this can be made by the custodian of so much confidential data , and that nationwide do not see fit to explain exactly what information was on the laptop .
the story that the police have advised them not to release more detail strikes me as rather hollow .
previous comments mentioning " scaremongering " reflect a head in the sand outlook and i am grateful that the media have brought this issue to my attention .
i have started moving some funds out from my nationwide accounts as i have been able to find better rates elsewhere .
i think that this occurrence will accelerate the process .
rbel , devon those who claim that the report is scaremongering do have a point but i doubt whether they would be equally relaxed if one day they discovered their identity had been stolen , their bank account emptied or huge debts run up in their name .
would they then also not expect the institution to make good the financial loss incurred , so that i do n't have to indirectly fund their loss ?
any of my employers would have regarded taking data , encrypted or otherwise , offsite to be a dismissible offence .
helen k , kent could nationwide be prosecuted under the data protection act ?
i have a loan with nationwide and am concerned that my personal details will become available to fraudsters .
francine paluch , northampton the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities w payne nationwide says customers will not be liable for fraud on their nationwide accounts as a result of this lapse but what will it do if someone steals an identity and uses it for purposes other than defrauding the nationwide accounts ?
if what we hear about identity fraud is true , the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities not necessarily only defrauding a nationwide account .
these uses may be more difficult for customers to keep track of .
w payne obviously there is a concern as a customer and i hope that nationwide will at least send statements soon after there has been an activity in an account .
claire medder , barking i ca n't think of any possible reason for holding the details of 11m customers on a laptop , and i 'd guess that if it was strongly encrypted the nationwide would have made this clear .
a bigger issue is how many times this has previously happened to other banks -lrb- or any other company -rrb- .
i 'd hazard a guess that it frequently happens but we 're never told about most breaches .
perhaps a law compelling companies to inform customers affected by a security breach should be introduced .
sas , oxford as a nationwide customer , i have only just learnt of this appalling situation by tuning into money box today .
as for some comments regarding your scaremongering - absolute rubbish , without free press and programmes such as money box we would all be in the dark , as i was before listening to your item .
there should be a full and open investigation into this situation , not least why this computer was allowed out of a secure bank and more importantly why we customers were not , and have still not , been informed of this incredible lax of security , putting us and our money at risk .
peggy brazil , birkenhead even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high marc thomas , oxford if the laptop was stolen with the intent of getting customer data the security risk is already very high .
if it has been stolen for the usual motive of sale for cash , it has probably been disposed of via a boot sale by now .
it is quite probable that if the machine is now being used it has been reformatted and the data will be hidden .
however , even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high .
those organised criminals have probably started to look quite hard for the laptop in question .
maybe they have a good chance of finding it , then what ?
perhaps your efforts to reveal this to the world have only made things worse .
by all means alert customers that they should be more vigilant , but do n't give criminals information that may help them to get our data .
do chastise business for lax data security , but for goodness sake do n't increase the risk by distributing useful information .
marc thomas , oxford surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history richard , birmingham there are so many avenues of attack for criminals these days , and we are being constantly reminded to carefully protect our details .
yet we still have to pay to check one of the most important records held about us - our credit histories .
surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history .
as someone who 's had to investigate a suspicious entry on my history , i would welcome the ability to keep track of what 's happening in my name .
richard , birmingham how dare a banking organisation allow its data to go to the relatively insecure location of an employee 's home ?
surely this is a matter for the information commissioner ?
is this practice outlawed by other financial institutions ?
unfortunately , i suspect not .
richard , reading i worked for years in the security team of a major banking group and no-one in that bank was allowed to use real customer data for testing or such purposes and no-one could take a copy of customer data to be used on their own computer -lrb- desktop or laptop -rrb- .
customer data is protected by the data protection act and is only allowed to be used by authorised users for legitimate purposes .
what could be the legitimate purpose be for an employee to have the details of 11m customers on a computer in their home ?
in any other organisation i have ever worked for , this would be seen as negligent at best if not actively flouting the dpa .
peter buck , dartford it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 simon , northamptonshire what a ridiculous sensationalising of this story .
it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 , and the people who stole it would n't have the skills or interest to interrogate the data .
we can almost certainly find more information about people on the internet by collecting the information that they 've willingly given to various websites .
so please stop being so sanctimonious and sensationalist in your reporting .
simon , northamptonshire surely the fundamental lapse in security is that an employee was allowed to take critical information into an insecure environment .
if the employee needed to do work at home , it seems improbable that they would have needed access to every customer 's account details .
graham williams , whittington , lancs oh dear , what a fuss !
i 've always trusted the nationwide and i do n't see any reason to not trust them now - do you think they 've not been doing anything ?
do you think they 're lying to us ?
stephen bould , folkestone i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop michael hardy , swindon i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop .
as a nationwide customer i would assume this data was held on a secured network protected by numerous firewalls and encryptions .
much more needs to be done to make identity theft a serious crime and more to protect the victims of identity theft from being prosecuted for other people 's debts .
i hope the fsa conducts an immediate and comprehensive inquiry into this whole sorry affair .
michael hardy , swindon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

the computer with customer information on it was stolen during a domestic burglary three months ago .
but details of the serious security lapse are only just emerging .
nationwide has apologised to customers and reassured them that they will not become identity-theft victims .
should financial firms be made to inform customers immediately after any security lapse ?
are you a nationwide customer ?
what do you think about the security lapse ?
read a selection of your comments below .
the theft of laptops , either from cars or properties , has been rife for several years now , so it seems rather irresponsible for such extensive customer information to be stored on one .
the nationwide has a lot of questions to answer and has let its members down badly in every respect .
roger drew , portsmouth as well as the potential for identity fraud , i 'm also very concerned about exactly what data was held on there .
it seems there may have been names and account numbers , but what about people 's credit ratings , current balance , and salary information ?
i would n't want all this information about me to be known publicly .
tim , norwich i have been with nationwide for almost 45 years , and have every faith in its security .
i also worked for 36 years in the it industry and believe that , based on its statements , it has done everything necessary to protect its customers .
this appears to be a media hype .
the media should be warning the public more about phishing which is more likely to be the way criminals will get any security data needed .
mike young , barnham no-one has yet asked the question , how many other nationwide employees are carrying their laptops around with them , potentially leaving them on buses or in taxis ?
i am a nationwide customer and am angry that this has been kept from me and that the boss of nationwide is hiding behind some police " advice " not to divulge some pretty basic facts , such as , are our names and addresses on that laptop ?
i 'm in two minds at the moment as to whether to pull my account .
mike , spalding i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts shashi g , loughborough i do not think this incident is as serious as the media makes it out to be .
if people read the statement given out by nationwide properly they say there is nothing to worry about .
i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts .
it is not fair to worry people for no reason .
think about the vulnerable people who are not likely to understand the situation and worry for no apparent reason .
i am a proud customer of nationwide and they have helped me out over the years so much when no other institution would .
shashi g , loughborough i am a nationwide customer and have always found them good .
but they should be made to advise customers immediately something like this happens so at least we change details or just be more vigilant with our accounts .
i 'm disgusted they deemed it a good idea to keep it under wraps .
at the end of the day it 's our money and financial security at risk - how dare they keep it quiet ?
a press release should have aired with in 24 hours .
paul pettifer , slough i have been a nationwide customer for what must be nearly 20 years .
in all that time the service has been excellent .
i am not worried about this hyped-up scare story .
joe lou , manchester we can hope that the data will never see the light of day - with the pc being recycled by the culprits .
if it does transpire that all this confidential data is in the hands of malicious thieves , then nationwide faces damage to its reputation of incalculable consequences .
mike forster , horsham there should be stricter rules on data protection malcolm gardner , shropshire i am a nationwide customer and feel i should have been informed a lot earlier .
there should be stricter rules on data protection and fines imposed when necessary .
malcolm gardner , shropshire i thought that your comments were foolish .
it seems at least possible that the thief felt he had just stolen a laptop .
the policy of first trying to ensure that potential harm is minimised , by replacing card numbers for example , seems exactly the correct one .
my security takes greater priority than your wish to publish .
otherwise , i have to say , you run a generally excellent programme .
neville cramer , cambridge the person who mentions that it 's all scaremongering has really lost the plot .
if they had their id stolen they would n't say that .
i also think that the person who took the laptop home and the person that authorised it -lrb- if someone had authorised it -rrb- should be dismissed immediately for gross negligence .
barbra smith , harrow i am surprised at the amount of people who do n't see this as an issue .
in it , we spend millions of pounds trying to stop people accessing personal data and here nationwide has handed it to someone on a plate .
you can not assume that it was merely " flogged for £ 20 in the pub " .
as someone with a daughter who has had her details stolen , the dismay , inconvenience , aggravation and tears that follow can not be trivialised .
i recommend that these people break out of their bubble and join me in the real world in 2006 !
pen the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure lucy bailey , hay-on-wye as a nationwide customer , i fully support its reasons -lrb- although not explicitly given -rrb- for not informing the public of the stolen laptop .
had the laptop been stolen from a branch , the situation might have been different -lrb- although the thief would have been on cctv -rrb- .
however , because it was an employee 's home , informing the public immediately would have certainly let the thief know the potential value of what they had stolen .
given the three month delay , it is more than likely that the laptop would have been wiped and sold on .
it 's all very well to say that wiped data can be retrieved , but if no-one knows it is there , who is going to want to retrieve it ?
the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure .
lucy bailey , hay-on-wye accounts seem to suggest that the taking of the laptop home was a breach of policy .
one would like to think that this would be an act of " gross misconduct " and the employee sacked .
the nationwide 's comments about the laptop being " password protected " are totally lame .
it is clear from his comments that encryption was not used .
nationwide claim that no customer has been or will be the victim of id fraud .
how does one prove that fraud was a result of data gained from the laptop - information may be of use with other organisations that have fewer security measures in place .
nationwide 's refusal to indicate exactly what data was stolen simply fosters the thought that rather more information was stolen than it is letting on - they are protecting themselves , not the customer .
andrew hana , bristol most thieves would n't guess who owned the laptop nor would they take the time to attempt to gain data from it .
if nationwide has been negligent enough to not encrypt its laptop drives then it should be reprimanded .
the data protection act states that every possible measure must be taken to secure important customer information .
mark d , london i am a nationwide fan and have been for over 10 years .
i have no problem with what i understand the situation to be at present and i am very content to leave it in the hands of those that know best as to the full extent of the issues - nationwide .
my anger is directed towards those that feel the need to break into property to steal from others .
nec , midlands events like this highlight the threat to innocent people in this electronic age .
it is naive to think that when we give our information to others it is completely secure .
it raises bigger questions that need to be addressed for example the government 's identity cards .
i 'm not against them in principle , but i disagree with government 's or other institutions holding my information on secure servers when this illustrates how easy it is to misplace the information .
jon , southampton this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight michael collett , france if the negligent employee really needed information about a customer or customers when away from his office , surely he could have downloaded that information from nationwide as and when he needed it , deleting it immediately after .
alternatively , he could have had the information on an external hard drive , other than with his laptop , but in an encrypted form .
this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight .
michael collett , france i am a relaxed nationwide customer john schultz , stockport i believe your programme is guilty of appallingly irresponsible scaremongering , and an outrageously unjustified accusation of indifference against nationwide .
every time i give someone a cheque , it reveals my name and account number .
and my address is in the phone book .
i use my e-mail address widely - i 've even given it to you below !
this is all readily available information about most people .
and how can you justify abusing your position by making a cheap jibe of indifference against those who merely follow police advice ?
i am a relaxed nationwide customer , am not an employee , and do n't know anybody who works for it .
john schultz , stockport thank you nationwide for not disclosing the theft quickly .
if they had the thief would have known the value of what he had and used it .
instead the thief almost certainly reformatted the disk to make it saleable .
david llewellyn , huddersfield i wo n't leave nationwide in regards to this incident .
nationwide has been so generous to me in several occasions .
i have been with them for the past seven years .
i will continue to be with them for the rest of my life .
i love my bank .
bashkim krasniqi , lewisham , london i take reasonable steps to protect my myself from identity theft .
i am therefore more than disappointed that nationwide may have compromised my efforts through a very basic data security failure .
it should be of great concern to customers that an error of judgement as fundamental as this can be made by the custodian of so much confidential data , and that nationwide do not see fit to explain exactly what information was on the laptop .
the story that the police have advised them not to release more detail strikes me as rather hollow .
previous comments mentioning " scaremongering " reflect a head in the sand outlook and i am grateful that the media have brought this issue to my attention .
i have started moving some funds out from my nationwide accounts as i have been able to find better rates elsewhere .
i think that this occurrence will accelerate the process .
rbel , devon those who claim that the report is scaremongering do have a point but i doubt whether they would be equally relaxed if one day they discovered their identity had been stolen , their bank account emptied or huge debts run up in their name .
would they then also not expect the institution to make good the financial loss incurred , so that i do n't have to indirectly fund their loss ?
any of my employers would have regarded taking data , encrypted or otherwise , offsite to be a dismissible offence .
helen k , kent could nationwide be prosecuted under the data protection act ?
i have a loan with nationwide and am concerned that my personal details will become available to fraudsters .
francine paluch , northampton the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities w payne nationwide says customers will not be liable for fraud on their nationwide accounts as a result of this lapse but what will it do if someone steals an identity and uses it for purposes other than defrauding the nationwide accounts ?
if what we hear about identity fraud is true , the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities not necessarily only defrauding a nationwide account .
these uses may be more difficult for customers to keep track of .
w payne obviously there is a concern as a customer and i hope that nationwide will at least send statements soon after there has been an activity in an account .
claire medder , barking i ca n't think of any possible reason for holding the details of 11m customers on a laptop , and i 'd guess that if it was strongly encrypted the nationwide would have made this clear .
a bigger issue is how many times this has previously happened to other banks -lrb- or any other company -rrb- .
i 'd hazard a guess that it frequently happens but we 're never told about most breaches .
perhaps a law compelling companies to inform customers affected by a security breach should be introduced .
sas , oxford as a nationwide customer , i have only just learnt of this appalling situation by tuning into money box today .
as for some comments regarding your scaremongering - absolute rubbish , without free press and programmes such as money box we would all be in the dark , as i was before listening to your item .
there should be a full and open investigation into this situation , not least why this computer was allowed out of a secure bank and more importantly why we customers were not , and have still not , been informed of this incredible lax of security , putting us and our money at risk .
peggy brazil , birkenhead even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high marc thomas , oxford if the laptop was stolen with the intent of getting customer data the security risk is already very high .
if it has been stolen for the usual motive of sale for cash , it has probably been disposed of via a boot sale by now .
it is quite probable that if the machine is now being used it has been reformatted and the data will be hidden .
however , even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high .
those organised criminals have probably started to look quite hard for the laptop in question .
maybe they have a good chance of finding it , then what ?
perhaps your efforts to reveal this to the world have only made things worse .
by all means alert customers that they should be more vigilant , but do n't give criminals information that may help them to get our data .
do chastise business for lax data security , but for goodness sake do n't increase the risk by distributing useful information .
marc thomas , oxford surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history richard , birmingham there are so many avenues of attack for criminals these days , and we are being constantly reminded to carefully protect our details .
yet we still have to pay to check one of the most important records held about us - our credit histories .
surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history .
as someone who 's had to investigate a suspicious entry on my history , i would welcome the ability to keep track of what 's happening in my name .
richard , birmingham how dare a banking organisation allow its data to go to the relatively insecure location of an employee 's home ?
surely this is a matter for the information commissioner ?
is this practice outlawed by other financial institutions ?
unfortunately , i suspect not .
richard , reading i worked for years in the security team of a major banking group and no-one in that bank was allowed to use real customer data for testing or such purposes and no-one could take a copy of customer data to be used on their own computer -lrb- desktop or laptop -rrb- .

any of my employers would have regarded taking data , encrypted or otherwise , offsite to be a dismissible offence .
helen k , kent could nationwide be prosecuted under the data protection act ?
i have a loan with nationwide and am concerned that my personal details will become available to fraudsters .
francine paluch , northampton the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities w payne nationwide says customers will not be liable for fraud on their nationwide accounts as a result of this lapse but what will it do if someone steals an identity and uses it for purposes other than defrauding the nationwide accounts ?
if what we hear about identity fraud is true , the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities not necessarily only defrauding a nationwide account .
these uses may be more difficult for customers to keep track of .
w payne obviously there is a concern as a customer and i hope that nationwide will at least send statements soon after there has been an activity in an account .
claire medder , barking i ca n't think of any possible reason for holding the details of 11m customers on a laptop , and i 'd guess that if it was strongly encrypted the nationwide would have made this clear .
a bigger issue is how many times this has previously happened to other banks -lrb- or any other company -rrb- .
i 'd hazard a guess that it frequently happens but we 're never told about most breaches .
perhaps a law compelling companies to inform customers affected by a security breach should be introduced .
sas , oxford as a nationwide customer , i have only just learnt of this appalling situation by tuning into money box today .
as for some comments regarding your scaremongering - absolute rubbish , without free press and programmes such as money box we would all be in the dark , as i was before listening to your item .
there should be a full and open investigation into this situation , not least why this computer was allowed out of a secure bank and more importantly why we customers were not , and have still not , been informed of this incredible lax of security , putting us and our money at risk .
peggy brazil , birkenhead even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high marc thomas , oxford if the laptop was stolen with the intent of getting customer data the security risk is already very high .
if it has been stolen for the usual motive of sale for cash , it has probably been disposed of via a boot sale by now .
it is quite probable that if the machine is now being used it has been reformatted and the data will be hidden .
however , even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high .
those organised criminals have probably started to look quite hard for the laptop in question .
maybe they have a good chance of finding it , then what ?
perhaps your efforts to reveal this to the world have only made things worse .
by all means alert customers that they should be more vigilant , but do n't give criminals information that may help them to get our data .
do chastise business for lax data security , but for goodness sake do n't increase the risk by distributing useful information .
marc thomas , oxford surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history richard , birmingham there are so many avenues of attack for criminals these days , and we are being constantly reminded to carefully protect our details .
yet we still have to pay to check one of the most important records held about us - our credit histories .
surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history .
as someone who 's had to investigate a suspicious entry on my history , i would welcome the ability to keep track of what 's happening in my name .
richard , birmingham how dare a banking organisation allow its data to go to the relatively insecure location of an employee 's home ?
surely this is a matter for the information commissioner ?
is this practice outlawed by other financial institutions ?
unfortunately , i suspect not .
richard gosset , reading i worked for years in the security team of a major banking group and no-one in that bank was allowed to use real customer data for testing or such purposes and no-one could take a copy of customer data to be used on their own computer -lrb- desktop or laptop -rrb- .
customer data is protected by the data protection act and is only allowed to be used by authorised users for legitimate purposes .
what could be the legitimate purpose be for an employee to have the details of 11m customers on a computer in their home ?
in any other organisation i have ever worked for , this would be seen as negligent at best if not actively flouting the dpa .
peter buck , dartford it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 simon , northamptonshire what a ridiculous sensationalising of this story .
it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 , and the people who stole it would n't have the skills or interest to interrogate the data .
we can almost certainly find more information about people on the internet by collecting the information that they 've willingly given to various websites .
so please stop being so sanctimonious and sensationalist in your reporting .
simon , northamptonshire surely the fundamental lapse in security is that an employee was allowed to take critical information into an insecure environment .
if the employee needed to do work at home , it seems improbable that they would have needed access to every customer 's account details .
graham williams , whittington , lancs oh dear , what a fuss !
i 've always trusted the nationwide and i do n't see any reason to not trust them now - do you think they 've not been doing anything ?
do you think they 're lying to us ?
stephen bould , folkestone i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop michael hardy , swindon i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop .
as a nationwide customer i would assume this data was held on a secured network protected by numerous firewalls and encryptions .
much more needs to be done to make identity theft a serious crime and more to protect the victims of identity theft from being prosecuted for other people 's debts .
i hope the fsa conducts an immediate and comprehensive inquiry into this whole sorry affair .
michael hardy , swindon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

the computer with customer information on it was stolen during a domestic burglary three months ago .
but details of the serious security lapse are only just emerging .
nationwide has apologised to customers and reassured them that they will not become identity-theft victims .
should financial firms be made to inform customers immediately after any security lapse ?
are you a nationwide customer ?
what do you think about the security lapse ?
read a selection of your comments below .
the theft of laptops , either from cars or properties , has been rife for several years now , so it seems rather irresponsible for such extensive customer information to be stored on one .
the nationwide has a lot of questions to answer and has let its members down badly in every respect .
roger drew , portsmouth as well as the potential for identity fraud , i 'm also very concerned about exactly what data was held on there .
it seems there may have been names and account numbers , but what about people 's credit ratings , current balance , and salary information ?
i would n't want all this information about me to be known publicly .
tim , norwich i have been with nationwide for almost 45 years , and have every faith in its security .
i also worked for 36 years in the it industry and believe that , based on its statements , it has done everything necessary to protect its customers .
this appears to be a media hype .
the media should be warning the public more about phishing which is more likely to be the way criminals will get any security data needed .
mike young , barnham no-one has yet asked the question , how many other nationwide employees are carrying their laptops around with them , potentially leaving them on buses or in taxis ?
i am a nationwide customer and am angry that this has been kept from me and that the boss of nationwide is hiding behind some police " advice " not to divulge some pretty basic facts , such as , are our names and addresses on that laptop ?
i 'm in two minds at the moment as to whether to pull my account .
mike , spalding i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts shashi g , loughborough i do not think this incident is as serious as the media makes it out to be .
if people read the statement given out by nationwide properly they say there is nothing to worry about .
i do not think it is fair of the media to be publishing reports without collecting proper facts .
it is not fair to worry people for no reason .
think about the vulnerable people who are not likely to understand the situation and worry for no apparent reason .
i am a proud customer of nationwide and they have helped me out over the years so much when no other institution would .
shashi g , loughborough i am a nationwide customer and have always found them good .
but they should be made to advise customers immediately something like this happens so at least we change details or just be more vigilant with our accounts .
i 'm disgusted they deemed it a good idea to keep it under wraps .
at the end of the day it 's our money and financial security at risk - how dare they keep it quiet ?
a press release should have aired with in 24 hours .
paul pettifer , slough i have been a nationwide customer for what must be nearly 20 years .
in all that time the service has been excellent .
i am not worried about this hyped-up scare story .
joe lou , manchester we can hope that the data will never see the light of day - with the pc being recycled by the culprits .
if it does transpire that all this confidential data is in the hands of malicious thieves , then nationwide faces damage to its reputation of incalculable consequences .
mike forster , horsham there should be stricter rules on data protection malcolm gardner , shropshire i am a nationwide customer and feel i should have been informed a lot earlier .
there should be stricter rules on data protection and fines imposed when necessary .
malcolm gardner , shropshire i thought that your comments were foolish .
it seems at least possible that the thief felt he had just stolen a laptop .
the policy of first trying to ensure that potential harm is minimised , by replacing card numbers for example , seems exactly the correct one .
my security takes greater priority than your wish to publish .
otherwise , i have to say , you run a generally excellent programme .
neville cramer , cambridge the person who mentions that it 's all scaremongering has really lost the plot .
if they had their id stolen they would n't say that .
i also think that the person who took the laptop home and the person that authorised it -lrb- if someone had authorised it -rrb- should be dismissed immediately for gross negligence .
barbra smith , harrow i am surprised at the amount of people who do n't see this as an issue .
in it , we spend millions of pounds trying to stop people accessing personal data and here nationwide has handed it to someone on a plate .
you can not assume that it was merely " flogged for £ 20 in the pub " .
as someone with a daughter who has had her details stolen , the dismay , inconvenience , aggravation and tears that follow can not be trivialised .
i recommend that these people break out of their bubble and join me in the real world in 2006 !
pen the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure lucy bailey , hay-on-wye as a nationwide customer , i fully support its reasons -lrb- although not explicitly given -rrb- for not informing the public of the stolen laptop .
had the laptop been stolen from a branch , the situation might have been different -lrb- although the thief would have been on cctv -rrb- .
however , because it was an employee 's home , informing the public immediately would have certainly let the thief know the potential value of what they had stolen .
given the three month delay , it is more than likely that the laptop would have been wiped and sold on .
it 's all very well to say that wiped data can be retrieved , but if no-one knows it is there , who is going to want to retrieve it ?
the way in which nationwide has dealt with this incident actually makes me feel more secure .
lucy bailey , hay-on-wye accounts seem to suggest that the taking of the laptop home was a breach of policy .
one would like to think that this would be an act of " gross misconduct " and the employee sacked .
the nationwide 's comments about the laptop being " password protected " are totally lame .
it is clear from his comments that encryption was not used .
nationwide claim that no customer has been or will be the victim of id fraud .
how does one prove that fraud was a result of data gained from the laptop - information may be of use with other organisations that have fewer security measures in place .
nationwide 's refusal to indicate exactly what data was stolen simply fosters the thought that rather more information was stolen than it is letting on - they are protecting themselves , not the customer .
andrew hana , bristol most thieves would n't guess who owned the laptop nor would they take the time to attempt to gain data from it .
if nationwide has been negligent enough to not encrypt its laptop drives then it should be reprimanded .
the data protection act states that every possible measure must be taken to secure important customer information .
mark d , london i am a nationwide fan and have been for over 10 years .
i have no problem with what i understand the situation to be at present and i am very content to leave it in the hands of those that know best as to the full extent of the issues - nationwide .
my anger is directed towards those that feel the need to break into property to steal from others .
nec , midlands events like this highlight the threat to innocent people in this electronic age .
it is naive to think that when we give our information to others it is completely secure .
it raises bigger questions that need to be addressed for example the government 's identity cards .
i 'm not against them in principle , but i disagree with government 's or other institutions holding my information on secure servers when this illustrates how easy it is to misplace the information .
jon , southampton this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight michael collett , france if the negligent employee really needed information about a customer or customers when away from his office , surely he could have downloaded that information from nationwide as and when he needed it , deleting it immediately after .
alternatively , he could have had the information on an external hard drive , other than with his laptop , but in an encrypted form .
this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight .
michael collett , france i am a relaxed nationwide customer john schultz , stockport i believe your programme is guilty of appallingly irresponsible scaremongering , and an outrageously unjustified accusation of indifference against nationwide .
every time i give someone a cheque , it reveals my name and account number .
and my address is in the phone book .
i use my e-mail address widely - i 've even given it to you below !
this is all readily available information about most people .
and how can you justify abusing your position by making a cheap jibe of indifference against those who merely follow police advice ?
i am a relaxed nationwide customer , am not an employee , and do n't know anybody who works for it .
john schultz , stockport thank you nationwide for not disclosing the theft quickly .
if they had the thief would have known the value of what he had and used it .
instead the thief almost certainly reformatted the disk to make it saleable .
david llewellyn , huddersfield i wo n't leave nationwide in regards to this incident .
nationwide has been so generous to me in several occasions .
i have been with them for the past seven years .
i will continue to be with them for the rest of my life .
i love my bank .
bashkim krasniqi , lewisham , london i take reasonable steps to protect my myself from identity theft .
i am therefore more than disappointed that nationwide may have compromised my efforts through a very basic data security failure .
it should be of great concern to customers that an error of judgement as fundamental as this can be made by the custodian of so much confidential data , and that nationwide do not see fit to explain exactly what information was on the laptop .
the story that the police have advised them not to release more detail strikes me as rather hollow .
previous comments mentioning " scaremongering " reflect a head in the sand outlook and i am grateful that the media have brought this issue to my attention .
i have started moving some funds out from my nationwide accounts as i have been able to find better rates elsewhere .
i think that this occurrence will accelerate the process .
rbel , devon those who claim that the report is scaremongering do have a point but i doubt whether they would be equally relaxed if one day they discovered their identity had been stolen , their bank account emptied or huge debts run up in their name .
would they then also not expect the institution to make good the financial loss incurred , so that i do n't have to indirectly fund their loss ?
any of my employers would have regarded taking data , encrypted or otherwise , offsite to be a dismissible offence .
helen k , kent could nationwide be prosecuted under the data protection act ?
i have a loan with nationwide and am concerned that my personal details will become available to fraudsters .
francine paluch , northampton the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities w payne nationwide says customers will not be liable for fraud on their nationwide accounts as a result of this lapse but what will it do if someone steals an identity and uses it for purposes other than defrauding the nationwide accounts ?

how does one prove that fraud was a result of data gained from the laptop - information may be of use with other organisations that have fewer security measures in place .
nationwide 's refusal to indicate exactly what data was stolen simply fosters the thought that rather more information was stolen than it is letting on - they are protecting themselves , not the customer .
andrew hana , bristol most thieves would n't guess who owned the laptop nor would they take the time to attempt to gain data from it .
if nationwide has been negligent enough to not encrypt its laptop drives then it should be reprimanded .
the data protection act states that every possible measure must be taken to secure important customer information .
mark d , london i am a nationwide fan and have been for over 10 years .
i have no problem with what i understand the situation to be at present and i am very content to leave it in the hands of those that know best as to the full extent of the issues - nationwide .
my anger is directed towards those that feel the need to break into property to steal from others .
nec , midlands events like this highlight the threat to innocent people in this electronic age .
it is naive to think that when we give our information to others it is completely secure .
it raises bigger questions that need to be addressed for example the government 's identity cards .
i 'm not against them in principle , but i disagree with government 's or other institutions holding my information on secure servers when this illustrates how easy it is to misplace the information .
jon , southampton this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight michael collett , france if the negligent employee really needed information about a customer or customers when away from his office , surely he could have downloaded that information from nationwide as and when he needed it , deleting it immediately after .
alternatively , he could have had the information on an external hard drive , other than with his laptop , but in an encrypted form .
this seems to me to be the grossest negligence , even if the risk of fraudulent use of the data is slight .
michael collett , france i am a relaxed nationwide customer john schultz , stockport i believe your programme is guilty of appallingly irresponsible scaremongering , and an outrageously unjustified accusation of indifference against nationwide .
every time i give someone a cheque , it reveals my name and account number .
and my address is in the phone book .
i use my e-mail address widely - i 've even given it to you below !
this is all readily available information about most people .
and how can you justify abusing your position by making a cheap jibe of indifference against those who merely follow police advice ?
i am a relaxed nationwide customer , am not an employee , and do n't know anybody who works for it .
john schultz , stockport thank you nationwide for not disclosing the theft quickly .
if they had the thief would have known the value of what he had and used it .
instead the thief almost certainly reformatted the disk to make it saleable .
david llewellyn , huddersfield i wo n't leave nationwide in regards to this incident .
nationwide has been so generous to me in several occasions .
i have been with them for the past seven years .
i will continue to be with them for the rest of my life .
i love my bank .
bashkim krasniqi , lewisham , london i take reasonable steps to protect my myself from identity theft .
i am therefore more than disappointed that nationwide may have compromised my efforts through a very basic data security failure .
it should be of great concern to customers that an error of judgement as fundamental as this can be made by the custodian of so much confidential data , and that nationwide do not see fit to explain exactly what information was on the laptop .
the story that the police have advised them not to release more detail strikes me as rather hollow .
previous comments mentioning " scaremongering " reflect a head in the sand outlook and i am grateful that the media have brought this issue to my attention .
i have started moving some funds out from my nationwide accounts as i have been able to find better rates elsewhere .
i think that this occurrence will accelerate the process .
rbel , devon those who claim that the report is scaremongering do have a point but i doubt whether they would be equally relaxed if one day they discovered their identity had been stolen , their bank account emptied or huge debts run up in their name .
would they then also not expect the institution to make good the financial loss incurred , so that i do n't have to indirectly fund their loss ?
any of my employers would have regarded taking data , encrypted or otherwise , offsite to be a dismissible offence .
helen k , kent could nationwide be prosecuted under the data protection act ?
i have a loan with nationwide and am concerned that my personal details will become available to fraudsters .
francine paluch , northampton the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities w payne nationwide says customers will not be liable for fraud on their nationwide accounts as a result of this lapse but what will it do if someone steals an identity and uses it for purposes other than defrauding the nationwide accounts ?
if what we hear about identity fraud is true , the information could be used for any number of fraudulent activities not necessarily only defrauding a nationwide account .
these uses may be more difficult for customers to keep track of .
w payne obviously there is a concern as a customer and i hope that nationwide will at least send statements soon after there has been an activity in an account .
claire medder , barking i ca n't think of any possible reason for holding the details of 11m customers on a laptop , and i 'd guess that if it was strongly encrypted the nationwide would have made this clear .
a bigger issue is how many times this has previously happened to other banks -lrb- or any other company -rrb- .
i 'd hazard a guess that it frequently happens but we 're never told about most breaches .
perhaps a law compelling companies to inform customers affected by a security breach should be introduced .
sas , oxford as a nationwide customer , i have only just learnt of this appalling situation by tuning into money box today .
as for some comments regarding your scaremongering - absolute rubbish , without free press and programmes such as money box we would all be in the dark , as i was before listening to your item .
there should be a full and open investigation into this situation , not least why this computer was allowed out of a secure bank and more importantly why we customers were not , and have still not , been informed of this incredible lax of security , putting us and our money at risk .
peggy brazil , birkenhead even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high marc thomas , oxford if the laptop was stolen with the intent of getting customer data the security risk is already very high .
if it has been stolen for the usual motive of sale for cash , it has probably been disposed of via a boot sale by now .
it is quite probable that if the machine is now being used it has been reformatted and the data will be hidden .
however , even after reformatting a large amount of data can be recovered so the security risk remains potentially high .
those organised criminals have probably started to look quite hard for the laptop in question .
maybe they have a good chance of finding it , then what ?
perhaps your efforts to reveal this to the world have only made things worse .
by all means alert customers that they should be more vigilant , but do n't give criminals information that may help them to get our data .
do chastise business for lax data security , but for goodness sake do n't increase the risk by distributing useful information .
marc thomas , oxford surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history richard , birmingham there are so many avenues of attack for criminals these days , and we are being constantly reminded to carefully protect our details .
yet we still have to pay to check one of the most important records held about us - our credit histories .
surely it 's about time that we had free access to our credit history .
as someone who 's had to investigate a suspicious entry on my history , i would welcome the ability to keep track of what 's happening in my name .
richard , birmingham how dare a banking organisation allow its data to go to the relatively insecure location of an employee 's home ?
surely this is a matter for the information commissioner ?
is this practice outlawed by other financial institutions ?
unfortunately , i suspect not .
richard , reading i worked for years in the security team of a major banking group and no-one in that bank was allowed to use real customer data for testing or such purposes and no-one could take a copy of customer data to be used on their own computer -lrb- desktop or laptop -rrb- .
customer data is protected by the data protection act and is only allowed to be used by authorised users for legitimate purposes .
what could be the legitimate purpose be for an employee to have the details of 11m customers on a computer in their home ?
in any other organisation i have ever worked for , this would be seen as negligent at best if not actively flouting the dpa .
peter buck , dartford it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 simon , northamptonshire what a ridiculous sensationalising of this story .
it 's most likely that the stolen pc was flogged down the pub on the night it was stolen for about £ 50 , and the people who stole it would n't have the skills or interest to interrogate the data .
we can almost certainly find more information about people on the internet by collecting the information that they 've willingly given to various websites .
so please stop being so sanctimonious and sensationalist in your reporting .
simon , northamptonshire surely the fundamental lapse in security is that an employee was allowed to take critical information into an insecure environment .
if the employee needed to do work at home , it seems improbable that they would have needed access to every customer 's account details .
graham williams , whittington , lancs oh dear , what a fuss !
i 've always trusted the nationwide and i do n't see any reason to not trust them now - do you think they 've not been doing anything ?
do you think they 're lying to us ?
stephen bould , folkestone i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop michael hardy , swindon i think it is absolutely disgusting that an employee was allowed to have this sort of information on a laptop .
as a nationwide customer i would assume this data was held on a secured network protected by numerous firewalls and encryptions .
much more needs to be done to make identity theft a serious crime and more to protect the victims of identity theft from being prosecuted for other people 's debts .
i hope the fsa conducts an immediate and comprehensive inquiry into this whole sorry affair .
michael hardy , swindon the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
