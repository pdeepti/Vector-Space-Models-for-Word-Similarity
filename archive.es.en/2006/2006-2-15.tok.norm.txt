" the protection of the right to human dignity is strict and an infringement is not permissible , " constitutional court president hans-jürgen papier said in his ruling . constitutional debate the law was drafted in response to the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states .
german president horst köhler signed the air safety bill into law last year , but urged the federal constitutional court to review it amid heated debate over whether germany 's constitution bars the government from killing citizens , even if that saves the lives of others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german hijacker threatened to fly a plane like this one into the european central bank the law came into effect in january last year , giving the german army the right to shoot down any plane it believes may have been hijacked and could be flown into a building . ' no one knows the situation of a plane ' the law was challenged by a group of former politicians and civil rights activists , with the support of the german pilots ' union which said that it could lead to a tragic mistake . the head of the pilots ' union , markus kirschneck , said last year : " no one who is on the ground and must make a decision about the directive can really tell what situation a plane is in .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 europe 's muslim of choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sought-after partner : tariq ramadan he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .
muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .
" how were they meant back then , and how are they to be understood and implemented today ? " joachim schubert-ankenbauer -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon debate .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

germany 's foreign minister said there was " nothing new . " " there is nothing new , " frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday evening .
shortly before , the web site of der spiegel newsmagazine published an article saying that rene bräunlich and thomas nitzschke were in good health and would soon be released from captivity in iraq . " i do n't comment on press reports , " steinmeier said , according to the associated press . spiegel-online said that german sources had received the information from sheikh harith al-dhari , head of the sunni muslim council of clerics .
just expressing hope ? a spokesman for the council , sheikh mohammed bashar al-fajdhi , said al-dhari had not announced the hostages ' imminent release , but had only expressed the hope that they would soon be freed , according to german broadcaster ard .
reuters also referred to a " prominent member of the council " who said the sheikh had merely expressed the hope the hostages would be released soon . a spokesman for al-dhari said germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , had spoken with the sheikh a third time on wednesday regarding the hostages , reuters reported .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.02.2006 taking on the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi look-alike maurizio antonini confounds the public a biting political satire , " bye bye berlusconi " has made quite a splash at the berlin film festival .
dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .

ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .

when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way .

sportsmanship is one thing but taking part in an olympic discipline for the glory of another country is taking it to the extreme .

now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "

many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .

it 's not exactly what 's happened but the germans are certainly giving belgium a hand . belgian biathlon fans were celebrating a bronze medal at the winter olympics this week despite the fact that they have no competitors in the competition and the recipient of the medal , martina glagow , was actually german . in fact , belgium stands to win a whole clutch of medals in turin , specifically in the biathlon and nordic skiing disciplines , because of a mix up in kit which places around 30 german athletes in the wrong camp . due to mistakes made in german sportswear giant adidas 's far east factories , german skiers have to wear caps in belgian national colors during the first week of the games . far east mess-up has germans representing belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian flag : not too dissimilar to the german one the confusion in the orient has led to the belgian flag - horizontal blocks of black-yellow-red - replacing the german flag - horizontal black-red-gold stripes - on the athletes ' official kit . " we regret this technical mistake and do apologize to all athletes , " adidas spokesperson jan runau said in a statement , adding that caps with the right colors would now be produced but would not arrive until next week . the belgian team , which consists of just five athletes - all of whom are taking part in skating disciplines - have yet to comment .
they must be very pleased at the prospect of their country doing very well in the first week 's skiing events , especially as they do n't have anyone featuring in them . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin take a look at these olympic-related articles in this special dw-world dossier .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?

right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the iran nuclear dispute opinion : more information on iran , please !
in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

sportsmanship is one thing but taking part in an olympic discipline for the glory of another country is taking it to the extreme .
it 's not exactly what 's happened but the germans are certainly giving belgium a hand . belgian biathlon fans were celebrating a bronze medal at the winter olympics this week despite the fact that they have no competitors in the competition and the recipient of the medal , martina glagow , was actually german . in fact , belgium stands to win a whole clutch of medals in turin , specifically in the biathlon and nordic skiing disciplines , because of a mix up in kit which places around 30 german athletes in the wrong camp . due to mistakes made in german sportswear giant adidas 's far east factories , german skiers have to wear caps in belgian national colors during the first week of the games . far east mess-up has germans representing belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian flag : not too dissimilar to the german one the confusion in the orient has led to the belgian flag - horizontal blocks of black-yellow-red - replacing the german flag - horizontal black-red-gold stripes - on the athletes ' official kit . " we regret this technical mistake and do apologize to all athletes , " adidas spokesperson jan runau said in a statement , adding that caps with the right colors would now be produced but would not arrive until next week . the belgian team , which consists of just five athletes - all of whom are taking part in skating disciplines - have yet to comment .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .
perhaps that will change after april 9 . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed jan henrik stahlberg and lucia chiarla -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .

to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .

the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .

why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.02.2006 taking on the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi look-alike maurizio antonini confounds the public a biting political satire , " bye bye berlusconi " has made quite a splash at the berlin film festival .
dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .

the deadly disease has now already reached four eu countries , including germany . it has come as a shock to health conscious germany to learn that bird flu , once a mystery ailment from asia , has now arrived on the picturesque baltic sea island of rügen .
holidaymakers on an ferry found the lifeless remains of four swans on friday , two of which initially tested positive for the deadly h5n1 strain of avian influenza . dick thomson from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said the virus was particularly worrying because it has been known to spread to humans . " for the most part this is an animal disease .
it is deadly to chickens and other birds , but this virus has been shown to leap to humans , which is unusual for an animal virus , " he explained .
" in half the cases we have identified , people have died from it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials warn people not to panic avian influenza can not jump easily from one human to the next as normal influenza viruses can .
however , scientists are worried that the two viruses , bird and human flu , could combine to produce a new virus that is both deadly and highly infectious - the two ingredients required for a pandemic . germany takes action health officials in germany as elsewhere are anxious to contain bird flu and keep it as far away from humans as possible .
at a press conference on tuesday , german agriculture minister horst seehofer stressed the urgency of the situation . " we must do everything possible to ensure the virus is not passed from wild birds to domestic birds , " he said and added that final confirmation of laboratory test results would come on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bird flu case " at frankfurt airport customs area the government has declared a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- security zone around the place where the swans were discovered .
it has also ordered all poultry farmers within 10 kilometers to immediately shut their livestock indoors .
the ruling to keep poultry cooped up will apply across the whole of germany starting feb .
17 . seehofer appealed to members of the public to report to the authorities any dead birds they may find in the countryside , but warned they should not under any circumstances touch the birds .
" this is a very dangerous animal virus and there is also a risk for humans , " he said .
" all our efforts must be focused on eliminating the danger of spreading the virus to humans . " preparing for the worst thomson of the who said acquiring the disease from animals is extremely rare , but one can not be too careful . " we have been encouraging governments to begin or continue with their pandemic preparedness .
we have been encouraging them , if they have the resources , to stockpile certain materials which they may find helpful during a pandemic , to encourage the development of vaccines , to think through how they will handle a very sudden or massive demand for health care services and whether or not they want to cancel mass gatherings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

" we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .
gül : hamas must embrace democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül are prepared to mediate in the middle east " since hamas has won the elections in a democratic manner , it must now act in a democratic manner , " the turkish foreign minister said . he dodged a question on whether a hamas delegation would visit turkey , but stressed that the international community must help to put the middle east back on the road to peace following the election results . " since there is a new situation in the region , we should all help .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament .

" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the iran nuclear dispute opinion : more information on iran , please !
in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

the deadly disease has now already reached four eu countries , including germany . it has come as a shock to health conscious germany to learn that bird flu , once a mystery ailment from asia , has now arrived on the picturesque baltic sea island of rügen .
holidaymakers on an ferry found the lifeless remains of four swans on friday , two of which initially tested positive for the deadly h5n1 strain of avian influenza . dick thomson from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said the virus was particularly worrying because it has been known to spread to humans . " for the most part this is an animal disease .
it is deadly to chickens and other birds , but this virus has been shown to leap to humans , which is unusual for an animal virus , " he explained .
" in half the cases we have identified , people have died from it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials warn people not to panic avian influenza can not jump easily from one human to the next as normal influenza viruses can .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 europe 's muslim of choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sought-after partner : tariq ramadan he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .
muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 europe 's muslim of choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sought-after partner : tariq ramadan he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .
muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .
" how were they meant back then , and how are they to be understood and implemented today ? " joachim schubert-ankenbauer -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon debate .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .

his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .

when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

in passing the controversial ngo law and creating a " public chamber " of prominent citizens loyal to him , his " managed democracy " system is complete .
the next test will be in early 2008 , when putin 's successor is selected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights are being curbed in putin 's russia additionally , russia has managed to stabilize itself financially and economically .
the russian economy has been growing for more than six years .
foreign debt has almost been completely paid off , and in january cash reserves totaled $ 181.4 billion -lrb- 152.5 billions euros -rrb- , a new high . foreign investment has increased because russia is considered a growth market for many european companies .
the country 's energy wealth and the high prices for gas and oil in the world markets have also played an important role . unconditional partnerships a third reason is russia 's new international alliances .
putin 's attempts to integrate into the west have failed .
the usa and the eu - most recently , germany - have criticized changes within russia .
the west has tied its cooperation to the acceptance of western values . in asia , the market of the future , russia has found acceptance without such political conditions - and not only as an exporter of oil and gas .
in the decade-old " shanghai cooperation organization , " an alliance between china , india and russia , a political security alliance - albeit a loose one - has been formed behind the idea of a " multi-polar world order .

" we have been encouraging governments to begin or continue with their pandemic preparedness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "

many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .

the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .

the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?

and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

" we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .
gül : hamas must embrace democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül are prepared to mediate in the middle east " since hamas has won the elections in a democratic manner , it must now act in a democratic manner , " the turkish foreign minister said . he dodged a question on whether a hamas delegation would visit turkey , but stressed that the international community must help to put the middle east back on the road to peace following the election results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 europe 's muslim of choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sought-after partner : tariq ramadan he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .
muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .
" how were they meant back then , and how are they to be understood and implemented today ? " joachim schubert-ankenbauer -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon debate .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .

to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .

we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .

walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .

" germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .

to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .

doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 15.02.2006 world cup security , safety gets thumbs up from fifa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : come and have a go if you think you 're hard enough : german security is ready for anything the ninth european police congress featuring 1300 police officials from 65 countries opened in berlin tuesday with delegates focusing on security issues surrounding the world cup being held in germany this summer . officials from fifa , the world soccer governing body , have described security precautions in germany as excellent and have high hopes for a smooth running month-long tournament . an event on the scale of the world cup inevitably raises fears about security threats , ranging from outbursts of hooligan violence to terror attacks carried out by muslim fundamentalists . during a panel discussion at the congress , the point was made , not for the first time , that 100 percent security can never be guaranteed .
wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

in passing the controversial ngo law and creating a " public chamber " of prominent citizens loyal to him , his " managed democracy " system is complete .
the next test will be in early 2008 , when putin 's successor is selected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights are being curbed in putin 's russia additionally , russia has managed to stabilize itself financially and economically .
the russian economy has been growing for more than six years .
foreign debt has almost been completely paid off , and in january cash reserves totaled $ 181.4 billion -lrb- 152.5 billions euros -rrb- , a new high . foreign investment has increased because russia is considered a growth market for many european companies .
the country 's energy wealth and the high prices for gas and oil in the world markets have also played an important role . unconditional partnerships a third reason is russia 's new international alliances .
putin 's attempts to integrate into the west have failed .
the usa and the eu - most recently , germany - have criticized changes within russia .
the west has tied its cooperation to the acceptance of western values . in asia , the market of the future , russia has found acceptance without such political conditions - and not only as an exporter of oil and gas .
in the decade-old " shanghai cooperation organization , " an alliance between china , india and russia , a political security alliance - albeit a loose one - has been formed behind the idea of a " multi-polar world order . " central asian nations rich in natural resources like kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan are starting to prefer russia to the democracy-transfers encouraged by the west .
in addition , the central asian pipeline network running through russia only strengthens russia as the great energy power in the 21st century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has solidified its position as a energy powerhouse no longer dependent on the west putin sees his two great ambitions within reach : the return of russia as a modern power , and the integration of his country in the world economy . questions remain as to whether russia , as the energy superpower , can truly justify its ambition and whether the modernization of the russia economy can proceed despite democratic deficits .
still , the prospect of integration into western structures is no longer a method of dealing with russia . the times during which russia depended on the west are over .
russia is not the former soviet union , but it is also not the weak , unstable country it was in the 1990s . ingo mannteufel -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de oil and energy top g8 meeting in moscow finance ministers of the group of eight economically-powerful countries gather in moscow friday for two days of talks likely to focus on russia 's swelling clout in world oil and gas markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 berlin to back ankara mediation if hamas renounces violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey says hamas must act democratically germany said it would back turkey 's offer to act as a mediator between israel and palestinian election winners hamas if ankara persuades the radical islamist group to renounce violence and recognize the jewish state . " we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .
gül : hamas must embrace democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül are prepared to mediate in the middle east " since hamas has won the elections in a democratic manner , it must now act in a democratic manner , " the turkish foreign minister said . he dodged a question on whether a hamas delegation would visit turkey , but stressed that the international community must help to put the middle east back on the road to peace following the election results . " since there is a new situation in the region , we should all help .
turkey has good ties with both sides so we are trying to do everything we can and give the right messages , " gül said .
" what is important is that peace is established in the region , " he added .
turkey close to israel and palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin invited khaled mashaal , head of hamas , to moscow turkey has been israel 's main regional ally since 1996 when the two struck a military cooperation deal , but it also has close ties with the palestinians and supports their claim to statehood .
israel , which has categorically ruled out any talks with hamas as long as it remains committed to the destruction of the jewish state , was infuriated last week after russian president vladimir putin invited hamas for talks in moscow . hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union but not by russia .

" we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .
gül : hamas must embrace democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül are prepared to mediate in the middle east " since hamas has won the elections in a democratic manner , it must now act in a democratic manner , " the turkish foreign minister said . he dodged a question on whether a hamas delegation would visit turkey , but stressed that the international community must help to put the middle east back on the road to peace following the election results . " since there is a new situation in the region , we should all help .
turkey has good ties with both sides so we are trying to do everything we can and give the right messages , " gül said .
" what is important is that peace is established in the region , " he added .
turkey close to israel and palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin invited khaled mashaal , head of hamas , to moscow turkey has been israel 's main regional ally since 1996 when the two struck a military cooperation deal , but it also has close ties with the palestinians and supports their claim to statehood .
israel , which has categorically ruled out any talks with hamas as long as it remains committed to the destruction of the jewish state , was infuriated last week after russian president vladimir putin invited hamas for talks in moscow . hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union but not by russia .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 europe 's muslim of choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sought-after partner : tariq ramadan he 's the man eu officials and journalists alike seek out when islam and western europe do n't see eye-to-eye .
muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .

he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .

when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .

in passing the controversial ngo law and creating a " public chamber " of prominent citizens loyal to him , his " managed democracy " system is complete .
the next test will be in early 2008 , when putin 's successor is selected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights are being curbed in putin 's russia additionally , russia has managed to stabilize itself financially and economically .
the russian economy has been growing for more than six years .
foreign debt has almost been completely paid off , and in january cash reserves totaled $ 181.4 billion -lrb- 152.5 billions euros -rrb- , a new high . foreign investment has increased because russia is considered a growth market for many european companies .
the country 's energy wealth and the high prices for gas and oil in the world markets have also played an important role . unconditional partnerships a third reason is russia 's new international alliances .
putin 's attempts to integrate into the west have failed .
the usa and the eu - most recently , germany - have criticized changes within russia .
the west has tied its cooperation to the acceptance of western values . in asia , the market of the future , russia has found acceptance without such political conditions - and not only as an exporter of oil and gas .
in the decade-old " shanghai cooperation organization , " an alliance between china , india and russia , a political security alliance - albeit a loose one - has been formed behind the idea of a " multi-polar world order . " central asian nations rich in natural resources like kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan are starting to prefer russia to the democracy-transfers encouraged by the west .
in addition , the central asian pipeline network running through russia only strengthens russia as the great energy power in the 21st century .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has solidified its position as a energy powerhouse no longer dependent on the west putin sees his two great ambitions within reach : the return of russia as a modern power , and the integration of his country in the world economy . questions remain as to whether russia , as the energy superpower , can truly justify its ambition and whether the modernization of the russia economy can proceed despite democratic deficits .
still , the prospect of integration into western structures is no longer a method of dealing with russia . the times during which russia depended on the west are over .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the iran nuclear dispute opinion : more information on iran , please !
in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .
at the same time , in tehran , that attack on the german embassy was organized with the call " death to germany . " that 's not how you should treat one another - especially not friends . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de solana mediates in cartoon dispute the eu 's foreign policy chief has begun a tour of the middle east to defuse the row over caricatures of the prophet mohammed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .

but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : spotlight on the berlinale berlinale film lineup includes four german entries tracking the golden bear berlinale strikes a serious note " love never goes out of fashion " culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.02.2006 taking on the big guys großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi look-alike maurizio antonini confounds the public a biting political satire , " bye bye berlusconi " has made quite a splash at the berlin film festival .
dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .
perhaps that will change after april 9 . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed jan henrik stahlberg and lucia chiarla -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .

" football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .

some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bird flu : the continuing threat germany 's media tangle with bird flu bird flu talks hailed a success after securing $ 1.9 billion the westward migration of bird flu bird flu : the facts europe -pipe- 15.02.2006 bird flu vaccine on the way ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bird flu has arrived in germany maria cheng , an expert on communicable diseases and bird flu at the world health organization in geneva , switzerland , talks to dw-world about the progress being made in developing a vaccine against avian influenza . dw-world : what is the status of a vaccine against bird flu for humans ? maria cheng : there are several countries working on bird flu vaccines .
they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .
perhaps that will change after april 9 . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed jan henrik stahlberg and lucia chiarla -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .
perhaps that will change after april 9 . sonia phalnikar and oliver samson interviewed jan henrik stahlberg and lucia chiarla -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale strikes a serious note the berlin international film festival , which opens on feb .

the deadly disease has now already reached four eu countries , including germany . it has come as a shock to health conscious germany to learn that bird flu , once a mystery ailment from asia , has now arrived on the picturesque baltic sea island of rügen .
holidaymakers on an ferry found the lifeless remains of four swans on friday , two of which initially tested positive for the deadly h5n1 strain of avian influenza . dick thomson from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said the virus was particularly worrying because it has been known to spread to humans . " for the most part this is an animal disease .
it is deadly to chickens and other birds , but this virus has been shown to leap to humans , which is unusual for an animal virus , " he explained .
" in half the cases we have identified , people have died from it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials warn people not to panic avian influenza can not jump easily from one human to the next as normal influenza viruses can .
however , scientists are worried that the two viruses , bird and human flu , could combine to produce a new virus that is both deadly and highly infectious - the two ingredients required for a pandemic . germany takes action health officials in germany as elsewhere are anxious to contain bird flu and keep it as far away from humans as possible .
at a press conference on tuesday , german agriculture minister horst seehofer stressed the urgency of the situation . " we must do everything possible to ensure the virus is not passed from wild birds to domestic birds , " he said and added that final confirmation of laboratory test results would come on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bird flu case " at frankfurt airport customs area the government has declared a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- security zone around the place where the swans were discovered .

" this is a very dangerous animal virus and there is also a risk for humans , " he said .
" all our efforts must be focused on eliminating the danger of spreading the virus to humans . " preparing for the worst thomson of the who said acquiring the disease from animals is extremely rare , but one can not be too careful . " we have been encouraging governments to begin or continue with their pandemic preparedness .
we have been encouraging them , if they have the resources , to stockpile certain materials which they may find helpful during a pandemic , to encourage the development of vaccines , to think through how they will handle a very sudden or massive demand for health care services and whether or not they want to cancel mass gatherings .

in passing the controversial ngo law and creating a " public chamber " of prominent citizens loyal to him , his " managed democracy " system is complete .
the next test will be in early 2008 , when putin 's successor is selected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil rights are being curbed in putin 's russia additionally , russia has managed to stabilize itself financially and economically .
the russian economy has been growing for more than six years .
foreign debt has almost been completely paid off , and in january cash reserves totaled $ 181.4 billion -lrb- 152.5 billions euros -rrb- , a new high . foreign investment has increased because russia is considered a growth market for many european companies .
the country 's energy wealth and the high prices for gas and oil in the world markets have also played an important role . unconditional partnerships a third reason is russia 's new international alliances .
putin 's attempts to integrate into the west have failed .
the usa and the eu - most recently , germany - have criticized changes within russia .
the west has tied its cooperation to the acceptance of western values . in asia , the market of the future , russia has found acceptance without such political conditions - and not only as an exporter of oil and gas .
in the decade-old " shanghai cooperation organization , " an alliance between china , india and russia , a political security alliance - albeit a loose one - has been formed behind the idea of a " multi-polar world order . " central asian nations rich in natural resources like kazakhstan , uzbekistan and turkmenistan are starting to prefer russia to the democracy-transfers encouraged by the west .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .

it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .

" we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .
gül : hamas must embrace democracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül are prepared to mediate in the middle east " since hamas has won the elections in a democratic manner , it must now act in a democratic manner , " the turkish foreign minister said . he dodged a question on whether a hamas delegation would visit turkey , but stressed that the international community must help to put the middle east back on the road to peace following the election results . " since there is a new situation in the region , we should all help .
turkey has good ties with both sides so we are trying to do everything we can and give the right messages , " gül said .
" what is important is that peace is established in the region , " he added .

israel , which has categorically ruled out any talks with hamas as long as it remains committed to the destruction of the jewish state , was infuriated last week after russian president vladimir putin invited hamas for talks in moscow . hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union but not by russia .

" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .

a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .

it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .

to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .

sportsmanship is one thing but taking part in an olympic discipline for the glory of another country is taking it to the extreme .
it 's not exactly what 's happened but the germans are certainly giving belgium a hand . belgian biathlon fans were celebrating a bronze medal at the winter olympics this week despite the fact that they have no competitors in the competition and the recipient of the medal , martina glagow , was actually german . in fact , belgium stands to win a whole clutch of medals in turin , specifically in the biathlon and nordic skiing disciplines , because of a mix up in kit which places around 30 german athletes in the wrong camp . due to mistakes made in german sportswear giant adidas 's far east factories , german skiers have to wear caps in belgian national colors during the first week of the games . far east mess-up has germans representing belgium bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the belgian flag : not too dissimilar to the german one the confusion in the orient has led to the belgian flag - horizontal blocks of black-yellow-red - replacing the german flag - horizontal black-red-gold stripes - on the athletes ' official kit . " we regret this technical mistake and do apologize to all athletes , " adidas spokesperson jan runau said in a statement , adding that caps with the right colors would now be produced but would not arrive until next week . the belgian team , which consists of just five athletes - all of whom are taking part in skating disciplines - have yet to comment .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .

" football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .

some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment .

a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?
any major change in this division of responsibilities would have an effect on the country 's principle of federalism , isensee said .
in addition , it raises financial questions - the states pay for police , while the army is financed on a national level . nonetheless , isensee pointed out , there are cases where the german army is deployed at home .
" the exceptions are rather narrow .
the constitution provides for cases where armed forces can be used , outside instances of defense , to protect civilian targets and control traffic .
the army can also be used in borderline situations , like when there are n't enough police and state troopers to protect civilians and defend against armed insurrectionists . " examples of this are guarding atomic transports , or protecting a town 's drinking supply from criminal contamination , isensee said .
whatever the case , the police nearly always retain the rights of law and decision-making , while the army serves as their helpers . division of authority the same goes for technical assistance from the army or the police .
soldiers help the police during natural catastrophes and bad accidents , when it is a question of public safety .
for example , german soldiers helped scrape off rooftops in bavaria , after several buildings collapsed under the weight of exceptional amounts of accumulated snow . another example is the aforementioned use of soldiers during the world cup football matches this summer .
organizing committees have discussed using soldiers for transportation , sanitation , logistics and even defense . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german men face compulsory military service further clouding the issue is the fact that policemen have sovereign authority , which gives them the right to carry out investigations and to use force .
they can ask someone to show an identity card , and can arrest someone who refuses - a useful ability when it comes to , say , preventing an unwanted person from entering a building or a soccer stadium .
but a soldier does n't have that right . isensee warned that germany should avoid going too far in mixing the rights and functions of soldier and policeman . " it is a legal tradition , that the army should not be allowed to exercise its potential power within society .
the army was educated to fill other functions , " he said . daphne antachopoulos -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

will germany alter its constitution to use its armed forces for internal security ?
some say a new high-court decision makes it less likely . with world cup crowds coming to germany this summer , the country will be facing a security challenge .
and once again , long-simmering question about the uses of germany 's army as an internal security force are being raised . according to the german constitution , the police are responsible for the country 's internal security and order , and the army -lrb- germany requires young men to do a year of compulsory military service -rrb- protects the country outside its borders . historical legacy the division , part of the country 's separation of powers , is seen as especially important in germany since hitler used the army as his means of gaining power . " this division makes sure that the power of the army can not be used to endanger internal freedom , or endanger that balance that a free nation needs , " said josef isensee , a law professor at the university of bonn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers were put to work scraping snow off overloaded rooftops in bavaria " the idea is that this keeps the army out of internal conflicts and internal dangers . " now , the bavarian csu , which has two ministers in germany 's governing coalition , is pressing for a change in the constitution that would allow more freedom to use the army , or bundeswehr , inside the country . csu pleads for change speaking wednesday in munich , csu leader edmund stoiber called on the government 's coalition partner , the spd , to get active on the issue .
" we are ready to talk , to get the necessary two-thirds majority in the bundestag and bundesrat , " germany 's two lawmaking bodies , stoiber said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police , and sometimes soldiers , guard transports of nuclear waste proponents of altering the constitution argue that the country needs to free up bundeswehr soldiers for security at the world cup , just three months away . " we can not just continue having fruitless discussions for months , " said bavarian interior minister günther beckstein . yet after a high-court decision wednesday said the mílitary could not shoot down planes thought to pose terrorist threats , social democratic parliamentary group leader peter struck made it clear that the spd will not try and change the constitution .
federal system endangered ? " for me , the subject is closed , " struck told journalists in berlin . the high-court decision now needs to be examined more closely to see which regulations can be changed , if at all , struck said .
but the court " set very narrow limits " on interpretation , he said . according to law professor isensee , the issue is made more difficult by the fact that the police are the responsibility of the states while the army belongs to the national government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world cup soccer stretch the police force too far ?

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .
the rioters in tehran on the other hand do not .
those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .
for they belong to the bassij - paramilitary vigilantes - supported by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . palestinian politicians told foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier that they regretted the recent riots in gaza , which were also aimed at german facilities .

in iran nuclear crisis , all eyes turn to russia world powers split over iran nuclear program iran calls un referral " the end of diplomacy " germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 opinion : germany and iran need to understand each other großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caricatures published in a german daily sparked new protests in tehran protestors attacked the german embassy in tehran on tuesday with stones and fire bombs .
the latest act in a wave of demonstrations could seriously harm german-iranian relations in the long-term , says dw 's peter philipp . the demonstrators in front of the german embassy in tehran on tuesday were particularly angered about a caricature published in the berlin daily der tagesspiegel last week . it showed four iranian soccer players with bombs strapped around their stomachs alongside four german soldiers under the headline : " why the german army absolutely must be deployed for the world cup . "
the newspaper has stated that it wanted to illustrate a domestic issue with the cartoon , namely the debate about deploying german troops during the world cup . but this message has not really reached iran correctly .
now , the attacks on the german embassy in tehran have strained german-iranian relations . self-interest rules german-iranian ties the traditionally close and good relations between germany and iran have seen - and survived - many a strain in the course of their history : the german student protests against the shah , the dispute over entertainer rudi carrell 's insult of khomeini , but also the implications surrounding the murder of iranian kurdish dissident exiles at the mykonos restaurant in berlin in 1992 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and iranian soccer fans get along fine in the stadium again and again , the two sides found their way back to a peaceful and friendly modus vivendi .
but most of the time , they did n't come around because of insight and reason , but rather self-interest . iran is interested in german imports and the german economy in the iranian market .
in times of recession , that 's reason enough not to bear a grudge . understanding should play a greater role self-interest also relegated to the fringe an aspect , which should actually play an important role in international relations : the attempt to understand the opposite side .
without such understanding , conflicts are practically pre-programmed . new aggravations are imminent for this reason .
this could have strong consequences on future relations . germany placed itself uncompromisingly on the side of the united states in the nuclear dispute with iran , even though there is no evidence for iran 's alleged ambitions to possess nuclear weapons .
chancellor angela merkel refers to iran as " a danger for democratic states " and tehran hits back with harsh words : merkel is to be equated with hitler and she works for the zionists - try to imagine this combination . there 's a difference between letters and fire bombs now , there is the dispute over the caricature in berlin 's der tagesspiegel .
the artist simply wanted to criticize the question of deploying german troops during the world cup .
yet he presented iranian soccer players as suicide bombers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this week 's issue of " newsweek " deals with iran 's relations to the west it is n't just an insult towards the iranian embassy , which is demanding an apology and threatening with legal action , but also for iranians living in exile .
they are bombarding the cartoonist with hate mail and death threats . in tehran , the mob attacked the german embassy - which had been spared the recent protests - with stones and molotov cocktails . but there 's a difference whether anonymous threatening letters are written in germany or whether a foreign embassy is attacked with fire bombs in the more than " safety-conscious " tehran . the letter writers have to expect legal action if they 're caught .

those few dozen - a marginal few in a city of eight million - can be certain that nothing will happen to them .

the deadly disease has now already reached four eu countries , including germany . it has come as a shock to health conscious germany to learn that bird flu , once a mystery ailment from asia , has now arrived on the picturesque baltic sea island of rügen .
holidaymakers on an ferry found the lifeless remains of four swans on friday , two of which initially tested positive for the deadly h5n1 strain of avian influenza . dick thomson from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said the virus was particularly worrying because it has been known to spread to humans . " for the most part this is an animal disease .
it is deadly to chickens and other birds , but this virus has been shown to leap to humans , which is unusual for an animal virus , " he explained .
" in half the cases we have identified , people have died from it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials warn people not to panic avian influenza can not jump easily from one human to the next as normal influenza viruses can .
however , scientists are worried that the two viruses , bird and human flu , could combine to produce a new virus that is both deadly and highly infectious - the two ingredients required for a pandemic . germany takes action health officials in germany as elsewhere are anxious to contain bird flu and keep it as far away from humans as possible .
at a press conference on tuesday , german agriculture minister horst seehofer stressed the urgency of the situation . " we must do everything possible to ensure the virus is not passed from wild birds to domestic birds , " he said and added that final confirmation of laboratory test results would come on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bird flu case " at frankfurt airport customs area the government has declared a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- security zone around the place where the swans were discovered .
it has also ordered all poultry farmers within 10 kilometers to immediately shut their livestock indoors .
the ruling to keep poultry cooped up will apply across the whole of germany starting feb .

the deadly disease has now already reached four eu countries , including germany . it has come as a shock to health conscious germany to learn that bird flu , once a mystery ailment from asia , has now arrived on the picturesque baltic sea island of rügen .
holidaymakers on an ferry found the lifeless remains of four swans on friday , two of which initially tested positive for the deadly h5n1 strain of avian influenza . dick thomson from the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- said the virus was particularly worrying because it has been known to spread to humans . " for the most part this is an animal disease .
it is deadly to chickens and other birds , but this virus has been shown to leap to humans , which is unusual for an animal virus , " he explained .
" in half the cases we have identified , people have died from it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials warn people not to panic avian influenza can not jump easily from one human to the next as normal influenza viruses can .
however , scientists are worried that the two viruses , bird and human flu , could combine to produce a new virus that is both deadly and highly infectious - the two ingredients required for a pandemic . germany takes action health officials in germany as elsewhere are anxious to contain bird flu and keep it as far away from humans as possible .
at a press conference on tuesday , german agriculture minister horst seehofer stressed the urgency of the situation . " we must do everything possible to ensure the virus is not passed from wild birds to domestic birds , " he said and added that final confirmation of laboratory test results would come on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " emergency bird flu case " at frankfurt airport customs area the government has declared a three-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- security zone around the place where the swans were discovered .
it has also ordered all poultry farmers within 10 kilometers to immediately shut their livestock indoors .
the ruling to keep poultry cooped up will apply across the whole of germany starting feb .
17 . seehofer appealed to members of the public to report to the authorities any dead birds they may find in the countryside , but warned they should not under any circumstances touch the birds .
" this is a very dangerous animal virus and there is also a risk for humans , " he said .
" all our efforts must be focused on eliminating the danger of spreading the virus to humans . " preparing for the worst thomson of the who said acquiring the disease from animals is extremely rare , but one can not be too careful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.02.2006 limited building-safety action follows snow chaos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scraping snow has become a daily event for many bavarians several roofs have collapsed in southern germany as a result of heavy snows , raising a debate on building safety measures .
now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

now , new evidence shows not only buildings , but bridges , too may need a closer look . when a flat-roofed ice rink caved in under the weight of heavy snows in bavaria in late january , killing 15 and injuring 34 skaters out for a day of fun , it was seen as a one-off tragedy .
but that was quickly followed by the collapse of a riding stable in the same area , and a few days later accumulated snow brought a corrugated tin supermarket roof crashing down .
other roofs have followed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops were called in to help ease the load on bavarian rooftops in the past few days , teams of volunteers - mostly firefighters , mountain rescue squads , and army recruits - have been mobilized throughout the bavarian alps to shovel off snowy roofs and minimize the chance of more building cave-ins .
the plan has , so far , been effective . thumbs down to ' building tüv ' inevitably , the disasters led to political debate about building safety .
after a hastily called summit on the subject , federal and state building officials , as well as germany 's official safety-certification agency tüv , ultimately decided against adopting a national system of building inspections that would mirror the current car-inspection system . their argument was that a " building tüv " would create too much bureaucracy yet still not ensure perfect safety , since buildings are more individual and complicated to test than cars . " periodic standard building inspections will not cater to the great variety of what are often highly complex structures , " said manfred bayerlein , managing director of tüv south , the agency responsible for certifying safety of thousands of products and services in southern germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they do cars - but do buildings make sense ?
" quick visual assessments , simply going through checklists and setting fixed survey intervals will not improve safety in the long term , " he said . currently , german civil law lays responsibility for building safety at the feet of the owners , and public buildings do undergo a battery of tests on everything from fire safety to adequate circulation .
but despite a criminal investigation into the bad reichenhall rink collapse , building owners generally do not face the threat of legal damages high enough to motivate extra safety measures . selective-inspection plan but safety will get more stringent come september , said german building and transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee .
that 's when he expects to put his plan for an inspection-controls system for certain types of buildings into action . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will be a while before anyone enters this snow-covered phone booth " after the buildings collapsed in bad reichenhall and -lrb- shortly afterward , in the polish town of -rrb- kattowitz , we can not just go back to business as usual , " tiefensee said in berlin last week .
" i have therefore arranged to check the buildings , making up a danger classification and setting verification criteria … we don ’ t want unnecessary bureaucracy , but we need more security . "
building expert and green party politician franziska eichstädt-bohlig warned against waiting too long to take action .
" the clock is ticking on many buildings , " she told the berliner morgenpost newspaper .
risk categories , timelines according to tiefensee 's plan , buildings will be checked for stability and statics .
they also include devising risk categories to decide which types of buildings should be checked , and how often .
flat-roofed constructions , as well as poured-concrete buildings from the 1950s are thought to need most renovation .
up to now , authorities have only gotten involved once damage is already visible .
exactly who will oversee the building checks has not been decided .
many of those involved think the job should go to local building-oversight officials , but there is a problem : budget reductions have slashed their capacity in recent years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many bridges are no longer seen as safe " this is exactly where a lot of jobs were cut in the past , " eichstädt-bohlig said . meanwhile , tiefensee seems to have another engineering-based problem on his hands - a new study has shown many of germany 's ageing bridges made of pre-stressed concrete are in poor condition . some 15 percent of highway bridges and highways made of pre-stressed concrete were labeled in " critical " or " dissatisfactory " condition , an internal study by the german transport ministry showed . the condition of 12.6 percent of the cases was " critical , " and 2.4 percent were " dissatisfactory " when it came to " quality , resilience , and security " according to a report in the bild am sonntag newspaper . bridges called ' time bomb ' while in 2001 , 17.6 percent of the bridges were marked " very good , " this year , just 7.1 percent were .
and 31.3 percent were described as only " satisfactory . " " the bridges are a time bomb , " said horst friedrich , an opposition fdp politician who specializes in transport issues , talking to bild am sonntag .
" no one knows if a bridge that is called ' dissatisfactory ' or ' critical ' can withstand a bad truck accident , " he added . as if german infrastructure did n't have enough problems right now , forecasters are calling for warm weather later this week .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .
to begin with , it 's just good entertainment , and the audience soon warms up to the clichés about what an idiot , what a clown berlusconi is .
but then we suddenly show that berlusconi really needs to be taken very seriously .
the worst thing you can do is underestimate him . hopefully , he 'll be history after april 9 . fact and fiction are often blurred in the film .
the camera team , for example , is prevented from shooting and ends up fearing for their lives .
did you have the same fears in real life ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the real berlusconi please stand up stahlberg : as a father of two , that was the second question i asked my lawyer .
what does the mob do when you annoy them ?
and he said they wo n't do anything , so long as you do n't annoy them too much .
the mafia wants to keep a low profile .
so long as you do n't come up with new information that might get them hot under the collar then you do n't need to fear for your life … there 's always the possibility of going to court and claiming compensation .
if it comes to that , then i 'd be financially ruined and i 'd have to go begging .
my lawyer says our chance of winning a case would be 60:40 , and i hope he 's a better lawyer than the one in the film - because he 's a loser . ms chiarla , in the film you describe yourself as a berlusconi exile in berlin .
is that true ? chiarla : it 's true .
i ca n't watch italian television anymore because as a woman , i feel completely debased .
and as an italian citizen , i do n't feel represented by a prime minister who has seventeen court cases against him pending .
and as an artist , there 's ever less work available because berlusconi cut the culture budget by 40 percent .
most movies are financed by berlusconi and at the moment , there 's just no place for me there .

dw-world interviewed its director , jan henrik stahlberg , and scriptwriter , lucia chiarla . dw-world : you 've made a film about the kidnapping of silvio berlusconi .
it 's in italian , it was shot in italy , features italian actors and an extremely convincing berlusconi double .
but you still do n't have an italian release .
do n't italians like the movie ? jan henrik stahlberg : the problem is not that they do n't like it .
whenever we 've talked to people who have refused the film , they tend to say : i 'm sorry , but i would n't make any money from this film because selling it to television stations is out of the question - and moreover , i have a family .
i 'm not saying that anyone who wo n't take the movie is cowardly .
the movie is very quirky , very anarchic , and dares to treat berlusconi the way we think he deserves to be treated - in a movie , admittedly .
in real life i would n't want to kidnap berlusconi .
but that kind of hard-line approach can be very unsettling .
i can understand why people think it 's scandalous .
i might not agree with that analysis , but the movie definitely is a double-edged sword .
it 's hilariously funny but it 's also dead serious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan henrik stahlberg your guerrilla-style promotion of the film has gotten attention , mainly because of the uncannily convincing berlusconi look-alike , whom you even dispatched to a meeting with angela merkel .
stahlberg : thanks to the reactions we 've had here at the film festival , we 've finally managed to hook up with some distributors .
we 've made the contacts , so if everything happens on schedule , we should get a theatrical release before the italian elections on april 9 .
if it really happens , it will be like christmas and easter all in one .
we 'd almost given up hope .
how did people react at the premiere ? lucia chiarla : very positively .
i was very glad to see that the audience understood that the subjects of censorship and media manipulation are not purely italian problems . mr. stahlberg , what did you mean when you said the film was the result of creative legal work ? stahlberg : when we first came up with the idea of kidnapping berlusconi we got really excited , drank lots of wine and hammered out a few ideas on the computer the next day , which we sent to my lawyer .
he faxed us back to say it was legally impossible .
we could n't believe it .
we thought the idea was inspired - a movie with heroes who are really anti-heroes , because kidnappings are always desperate measures , but at the same time , the heroes are likeable because they 're doing something that we , as passive members of the audience , would also like to do .
so we ended up drinking lots of wine with our lawyer , and reached the conclusion that either berlusconi would have to give his permission , or we would have to do it in such a way that he did n't realize it was all about him .
we worked together with the lawyer very closely .
finally , the lawyer even ended up cutting out certain scenes in the editing suite .
no one could promise that i 'd win if i was taken to court , but we would have a legal defense .
bildunterschrift : a scene from " bye bye berlusconi " did the lawyers provide any artistic input ? stahlberg : they had artistic input insofar as the film gained a quirkier aspect .

muslim intellectual tariq ramadan has been in demand again recently . there may not be a muslim intellectual more popular at the moment than tariq ramadan .
if he 's not holding lectures in french suburbs in front of excited young people , he 's celebrated like a head of state during visits to khartoum in sudan .
the british government uses him as a top-level consultant , and the eu has made him a regular on every commission dealing with intercultural or inter-religious dialogue .
his message rarely wavers : " it is possible to be both european and a muslim . " grandson of a radical muslim it 's a sentiment many european muslims would outright reject .
as danish flags burn in the middle east , the dispute over the publication of mohammed caricatures in a danish newspaper threatens to deepen divide between europe and its 11 million-strong muslim community .
ramadan has been in demand of late , traveling from talk show to talk show to try and bring some reason and perspective into a debate spiraling out of control .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at a recent discussion on swiss television , ramadan said that he understood the outrage in arabic countries and , once again , explained why the caricatures had been offensive .
he also gauged the level of reaction as exaggerated and repeated what has become his mantra . " i 've never suffered because of my heritage in europe , " said ramadan .
the statement carries special weight given that his grandfather was the founder of the muslim brotherhood , to which all radical islamists trace their roots . the ideal of a " european islam " " i 've experienced the contact to the cultures around me as completely positive .
i never saw that as something threatening , " he said .
" through my personal experience , i 've been able to pass along to muslims one fundamental idea : it 's possible to be both a european and a muslim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both a european , and a muslim ramadan 's notion of a " european islam " that distances itself from the dreams of the restoration of the caliphate shared by fundamental muslims in many arabic countries has yet to receive widespread acceptance in europe .
many europe countries have only recently begun seeking dialogue with their muslim communities .
french intellectuals and politicians call ramadan , who studied french literature and islamic studies and resides in geneva , two-faced . " there is an enormous amount of mistrust towards me , " said ramadan .
" they say that what i 'm saying is too good to be true , and that i must say something else when i speak in arabic .
trust is missing , the progress made is not acknowledged . " denied us visa skepticism is not limited to europe .
when the university of notre dame asked ramadan to visit as a guest professor last year , the united states government denied him an entry visa .
that same year , time magazine named him to a list of the 100 most important thinkers in the world . the controversy surrounding ramadan is perhaps explained by the fact that his proposals demand more than either side is willing to give .
western europeans find it hard to imagine islam finding a place in their modern , pluralistic society .
muslims , on the other hand , are unwilling to let their religious traditions submerge under the secularism widespread in many european societies .
ramadan is frequently asked on which side he stands , an answer he is often unwilling to give . finding a modern islam " muslims simply can not allow themselves to do the west a favor .
i can sit here and tell you , ' yes i 'm a liberal muslim . '
then i go to the muslim world and nobody listens to me , " he said .
he said it 's important to work from within .
" you need to have a debate with the muslims about the old scriptures , about corporal punishment or the death penalty , " he said .
" how were they meant back then , and how are they to be understood and implemented today ? " joachim schubert-ankenbauer -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cartoons that shook the world read dw-world 's dossier on the cartoon debate .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?

it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .
why is that ? there are still about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year from influenza .
so it is a very serious disease . by encouraging people to get vaccinated for that , it will hopefully lessen the burden of this disease . louisa schaefer interviewed maria cheng send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new cases of bird flu discovered in germany european union veterinary experts are holding talks in brussels later today to discuss the growing threat from bird flu .

they ’ re using h5n1 strains that were circulating in vietnam .
the problem is that we can ’ t actually create an exact vaccine to match the pandemic strain until that strain actually emerges .
but what they ’ re doing is essentially working on the premise that h5n1 will turn into a strain that causes a pandemic and hopefully that will give them the time to do the background work now so that it can be put into production as soon as the pandemic strain does emerge . the fear is that the deadly h5n1 strain of bird flu will mutate and cause new forms of human flu viruses .
how can a vaccine be developed for something that does not yet exist ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health officials in southern italy examine a dead swan on monday based on the idea that h5n1 will evolve into a form that will spark a pandemic , we can essentially do a lot of the research now so we can work on the existing h5n1 strains as if that will be the one to cause the pandemic .
what companies can essentially do is file a lot of the paperwork that needs to be filed when that does come up so that the licensing agreements , clinical trials and safety requirements are done in advance .
this bureaucracy and paperwork is then done ahead of time , so that when the pandemic strain does emerge , what they can do is switch the strains within the component for the vaccine and that can be put into commercial production . so are you saying that to develop a vaccine , it ’ s often not the scientific research that is lagging behind , but the paperwork ? in the case of influenza , yes , because for influenza we do have vaccines , seasonal vaccines that get changed every year .
doing that for a pandemic vaccine would essentially be the same process .
of course , h5n1 is very different from normal , seasonal influenza , so a bit more research has to be done in terms of safety requirements and clinical trials .
but in terms of licensing and things like liability - who ’ s going to be responsible for this - that can all be done ahead of time . what about a vaccine against bird flu for animals ? who can ’ t really comment on that .
we have to rely on our colleagues from the animal health authorities .
we track human health more closely . what can people do ?
in germany , there are now the first reported and confirmed cases of bird flu .
do people just have to sit tight ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is still primarily an animal disease as far as the general public goes , i would emphasis that avian influenza , h5n1 , is primarily an animal disease .
it ’ s not something that transmits readily to humans at all .
what we ’ re concerned about is if it mutates into a form that would spark a pandemic .
right now , who has the same recommendation as we do for normal , seasonal influenza .
people in vulnerable groups such as the elderly or the very young get vaccinated .
for the public , it ’ s about having their awareness raised and to practice good hygiene , like washing their hands .
beyond that , we can ’ t recommend much at this point since the pandemic has not emerged . nonetheless , some doctors recommend that people get vaccinated each year against the current forms of influenza .

" we would have no objection to a mediation initiative by turkey if it can influence hamas " to fulfill the conditions required for diplomatic relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told a joint press conference with his turkish counterpart abdullah gül on tuesday . those conditions are that hamas break from its violent past , recognize israel and accept the so-called " roadmap " to middle east peace drawn up by international quartet , the german minister said . steinmeier , who flew into turkey for a brief working visit after a tour of israel , the palestinian territories and jordan , said he had agreed with gül to pursue efforts for peace in the middle east , but only if hamas agreed to the conditions . last month , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan announced that his country was ready to act as an intermediary between israel and hamas , counting on ankara 's good ties with both sides .
he also called on the international community to accept the outcome of the palestinian elections and urged hamas to renounce its past , a message that was echoed by gül on tuesday .

" since there is a new situation in the region , we should all help .
turkey has good ties with both sides so we are trying to do everything we can and give the right messages , " gül said .
" what is important is that peace is established in the region , " he added .
turkey close to israel and palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin invited khaled mashaal , head of hamas , to moscow turkey has been israel 's main regional ally since 1996 when the two struck a military cooperation deal , but it also has close ties with the palestinians and supports their claim to statehood .
israel , which has categorically ruled out any talks with hamas as long as it remains committed to the destruction of the jewish state , was infuriated last week after russian president vladimir putin invited hamas for talks in moscow . hamas is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and european union but not by russia .
israel is trying to ensure that other european countries do not agree to meet with the organization . steinmeier gave the israeli leadership backing on monday in its campaign to maintain the international isolation of hamas . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier defends eu stance on hamas on his middle east tour , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier defended europe 's refusal to sit down with hamas , while palestinian leaders urged the international community to continue providing aid .

wolfgang gunkel , a former police official and now social democrat parliamentarian , told the assembled security chiefs that he was confident that there would be enough police on the ground to cope with the challenges . " of the 48 first-round matches there are not more than 12 which will require maximum safety precautions , " he said .
" given the fact that 250,000 regional police and 30,000 federal police will be assigned to world cup security , i think we ’ ll be able to minimize the risks drastically . " hooligan worries remain but germany is well-equipped bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence in stadiums is rare but outside is a different matter what appears to worry german authorities more than violence at the games , however , is the prospect of outbursts of hooligan violence taking place far away from stadiums . at so-called public viewing events , thousands of fans will be able to watch matches on giant video screens in selected german cities .
to reduce the risk of violence , conference participants agreed that it was important to prevent known hooligans from entering germany . cooperation between german and british police was praised in this respect because of their joint efforts aimed at identifying violent fans .
walter gagg , the director of stadium security at fifa says current preparations are very thorough . " we are very pleased and very happy with the organization and with the infrastructure in the stadiums , " he said .
" we know we are in a country with open borders but we ’ ll have full security regarding the so-called hooligans .
we are convinced that security wise we ’ ll have one of the best world cups we ever had . " terror threat at world cup low , say officials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police will be armed and ready for any threat regarding possible threats of terror attacks , germany is also placing great emphasis on prevention , meaning that terror suspects are to be identified when crossing the border or even well before coming to germany . in addition , nato awacs surveillance planes will monitor german airspace to guard against airborne attacks . gagg played down the possibility of a terrorist attack on the tournament , saying soccer - unlike the olympic games - had never fallen victim to such an act of terrorism before . " football has never , really never , been sought out by terrorist attacks at this level .
we are convinced we wo n't have any terrorist actions against the soccer world cup , " he said . however , willy kösling , a german security official responsible for world cup preparations said : " thank god , we have no concrete indications of a particular concrete threat in the area of terrorism , but we ca n't rule it out .
we hope it stays that way . " fifa would welcome bundeswehr involvement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a troop deployment would not be opposed by fifa police officials at the congress were skeptical whether germany 's armed forces should become involved in world cup security beyond that .
some german politicians want bundeswehr troops to support police forces during the event .
walter gagg said fifa would n't object if the german government was to deem this necessary . " this is a matter for the german state , " he said .
" but we are convinced that the german government together with the organizing committee will find the right solution and they can use these additional people for the excellent organization of the world cup . " he added that the presence of troops , as well as police , could play a positive role in guaranteeing security during the tournament . " absolutely , we believe that if a country is convinced it would like to have an additional support for the police , then it 's appropriate to use it , " he said , citing the winter olympics in italy as an example .
" look at turin now , and how many troops are deployed there just to be able to organize these games . " germany debates troops in security role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble has not given up on his plan for the army germany 's conservative interior minister wolfgang schäuble is advocating the use of troops as a supplementary security force to aid the already over-stretched german police despite widespread opposition and the need for a change of constitution to deploy the armed forces on german soil in a military or security capacity . defense ministry officials have said they planned to deploy only 2,000 german troops for the world cup providing medical , transport and facilities support as well as specialists for dealing with nuclear , chemical or biological attacks .
such a mission would not infringe on the constitutional law which prevents the bundeswehr from domestic deployment . ' unsafe ' stadiums get approval bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stiftung warentest 's report caused fury in german soccer circles congress participants also dismissed concerns about allegedly unsafe german stadiums .
a recent report by stiftung warentest , the german consumer group , condemned four stadiums as potentially fatal crowd traps .
gagg said these reports were exaggerated and that visitors need n't fear for their lives in an emergency . " we are happy , we have good stadiums here in germany , they have full security infrastructure , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slowly moves towards army deployment at world cup despite germany 's defense minister saying that troops wo n't be deployed at the world cup , reports say bundeswehr personnel will be used while conservative politicians adapt plans that could put the army on the streets .

us methods of execution lethal injection : authorized in 37 states electrocution : in 10 states -lrb- sole method in nebraska -rrb- gas chamber : in five states -lrb- all of which have lethal injection as alternative -rrb- hanging : only in new hampshire and washington firing squad : in idaho and oklahoma source : dpic prosecution and defence lawyers quoted by the judge acknowledged that the chemicals would be extremely painful to anyone awake enough to feel them .
medical experts have however argued that the dose of sedatives is strong enough to make almost anyone unconscious within a minute .
judge fogel said california state must give convicts a fast-acting dose of barbiturates to ensure they are unconscious before the toxins are administered .
alternatively , he said , a medical expert could be present to ensure they are not conscious .
if the state rejects his recommendations , judge fogel said he would postpone the execution and order court hearings into california 's method of lethal injection .
morales was sentenced to death after being found guilty of the rape and murder of a teenager in 1981 .

thousands of sea birds were killed and 120 miles of coastline contaminated .

many studies were conducted on the effects , with one common theme that the damage could have been far worse .
had the tanker run aground in may or june there would have been many millions more birds in the area .

figures released on wednesday revealed there was an average 12 % pay gap between men and women in wales .
women working part-time were even worse off , earning 31 % less than men .
the statistics are disappointing to campaigners , still working to redress the balance 30 years after the creation of the eoc , the sex discrimination act , and the equal pay act .
women working in wales 75 % work in cleaning , catering , caring , clerical work and customer services women 's retirement income is only 57 % of men 's 38 % of calls to the eoc wales helpline concern pregnancy and maternity women continue to be under-represented at senior levels , e.g. 78 % of nhs staff are women but only 20 % of hospital consultants just 8 out of 40 welsh mps are women ; only four out of the 22 councils have female leaders " women have still not got equal pay with men , " said kate bennett , director of the eoc in wales .
" they still experience widespread discrimination and pay a high penalty for having children and other care responsibilities in terms of their career , pay and pensions . "
ms bennett said the eoc was looking forward to the introduction of new rules to make public sector employers positively promote equality rather than merely take steps to prevent discrimination in the workplace .
the gender equality duty - which comes into force in 2007 - is being heralded as the most significant change to gender equality legislation in 30 years .
it will require public bodies to eliminate sex discrimination and promote equality throughout their services , policies , employment and recruitment practices .
" equality for all remains our goal , and we are determined to work with as broad a range of people as we can to ensure better opportunities for our children in the future , " she added .
neil wooding , eoc commissioner for wales said simpler and stronger legislation was needed to help more women .
" we need to build on the passion , courage and determination shown by women and men in wales in challenging adversity and pursuing fairness and justice , " he said .
" we are positive that together we can make good progress in the year ahead . "

government official liu zhengrong said western criticism of china 's internet censorship smacked of double standards .
he also said no one had been arrested just for writing online content .
according to a bbc correspondent in beijing , rupert wingfield-hayes , these assertions contrast sharply with a number of recent cases .
several people are reported to have been jailed in recent years for posting information on the internet deemed subversive .

the chinese official 's comments came amid mounting concern in the us about how its companies are operating in china , because of local regulations .
internet firm yahoo has been accused by human rights groups of providing information to chinese authorities that led to two internet users - inlcuding mr shi - being imprisoned .
companies like google have also been criticised for deciding to censor their search engines in china .
china 's authorities are also facing internal opposition to a crackdown on media freedom .
on tuesday , a group of former senior communist party officials published an open letter to denounce the recent closure of investigative newspaper bingdian -lrb- freezing point -rrb- , and said strict censorship might " sow the seeds of disaster " for china 's political transition .
' unfair ' for years the outside world has been criticising china for its control of the internet .
now the beijing government is hitting back , our correspondent says .
china is no different from western nations like the us and britain in the way it controls the internet , argued mr liu zhengrong , deputy chief of the internet affairs bureau of the state council information office .
" after studying internet legislation in the west , i 've found we basically have identical legislative objectives and principles , " mr liu was quoted as telling the state-run china daily newspaper on tuesday .
" it is unfair and smacks of double standards when -lrb- foreigners -rrb- criticise china for deleting illegal and harmful messages , while it is legal for us websites to do so , " he said .
he also said that only a " very few " foreign websites were blocked , and that was mostly because they contained pornography or terrorist information .
the bbc news website continues to be blocked in china .
and he insisted that " no one in china has been arrested simply because he or she said something on the internet " .
another well-known case which appeared to contradict this statement involves li zhi , who was sentenced to eight years in jail in 2003 for " subversion " .
human rights groups said mr li and four others jailed in 2003 were posting opinions on the internet and calling for political change .

his performance opened the mobile entertainment summit at the 3gsm world congress and was a timely reminder of how swiftly handsets are morphing into media devices .
numerous deals and alliances announced at the show underscored how so-called content - be it music , video clips , images or tv shows - is starting to matter to mobile operators .
at the show virgin announced a tie-up with bt and microsoft to offer tv on mobiles , o2 unveiled a deal with hp and virgin radio on interactive radio services , motorola and microsoft got together to put the windows media player on handsets , and ericsson and napster linked up to offer download services .
before now , motorola unveiled a phone with the itunes music player on it and nokia talked up a handset with a multi-gigabyte hard drive on it .
the list goes on and shows how determined mobile operators are for the handset to become a store for , and guide to , any and every kind of media .
follow the money in some respects they have no choice but to pursue this course as their strategy for making money out of third-generation networks demands that users download far more data than they do today .
third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- networks make voice calls so cheap that operators can no longer rely on that service for their biggest slice of income . "
if we were going to embrace the community more , it had to be user-generated .
we want to make them the superstars of the site and give them exposure " matt dicks , ministry of sound they hope that media on mobiles will become the money earner that offsets the cash lost from voice call revenue .
some broader trends of net use suggest that these strategies could pay off .
many people are starting to use their camera phone to take snaps of what they see , who they are with and what they are doing .
often these images get uploaded to online photo albums and some people populate their own mobile weblog , or moblog , with the snaps they take .
some are even uploading videos they have shot .
the ministry of sound superclub is one organisation seeking to use this trend and at 3gsm unveiled a service that lets club goers upload and share videos .
revenue from the uploads is shared with the person that shot the short clip .
matt dicks , head of media at the ministry of sound , said there was a large community of regular ministry goers interested in the service .
he said it also helped the ministry do more with its website which is currently more of an information point than a community touch-stone .
" if we were going to embrace the community more , it had to be user-generated , " said mr dicks .
" we want to make them the superstars of the site and give them exposure . "
misplaced hopes mobile phone firms might also be able to tap into trends that show how the consumption of media is changing .
increasing numbers of net users are using syndication systems so they can download episodes of the shows they like and watch them at their convenience .
many store such shows on portable media players and watch or listen on the go .
with the memory on phones growing all the time , it may not be too far in the future when that portable media device is a phone rather than an ipod .
but there are some factors that suggest the mobile operators ' dream of skies swimming with data are misplaced .
to begin with , it is unlikely that mobile users will want to download huge amounts of data while on the move .
this is simply because although 3g networks pump data around faster than ever , it is still painfully slow to download lots of data to a phone .
current pricing systems which only let people download a certain amount of data per month also mitigate against this , although these are starting to change .
for instance vodafone 's live ! service only charges for what people buy , such as a game , not to transport it to their handset .
there has been much talk of phone owners watching tv on their handsets and there are many trials of these systems in place .
however , feedback from the trials suggest that putting in place the infrastructure to let lots of people watch while they walk , along with the cost of subsidising handsets , might make it an expensive proposition for operators .
it is also not clear whether users will be able to sit and watch long tv programs while they commute .
initially coverage may be a problem and , if people are commuting , they may not be stationary for long enough to enjoy an entire episode at one time .
it is more likely that people will sign up to see clips at key moments such as when their favourite football team scores .
but if the exact future of mobile media is unclear because so many deals are being signed and technologies are being tried out , it is obvious that your phone is going to be at the centre of the storm .
hold on and keep watching .

to begin with , it is unlikely that mobile users will want to download huge amounts of data while on the move .
this is simply because although 3g networks pump data around faster than ever , it is still painfully slow to download lots of data to a phone .
current pricing systems which only let people download a certain amount of data per month also mitigate against this , although these are starting to change .
for instance vodafone 's live ! service only charges for what people buy , such as a game , not to transport it to their handset .
there has been much talk of phone owners watching tv on their handsets and there are many trials of these systems in place .
however , feedback from the trials suggest that putting in place the infrastructure to let lots of people watch while they walk , along with the cost of subsidising handsets , might make it an expensive proposition for operators .
it is also not clear whether users will be able to sit and watch long tv programs while they commute .
initially coverage may be a problem and , if people are commuting , they may not be stationary for long enough to enjoy an entire episode at one time .
it is more likely that people will sign up to see clips at key moments such as when their favourite football team scores .
but if the exact future of mobile media is unclear because so many deals are being signed and technologies are being tried out , it is obvious that your phone is going to be at the centre of the storm .

matt dicks , head of media at the ministry of sound , said there was a large community of regular ministry goers interested in the service .

misplaced hopes mobile phone firms might also be able to tap into trends that show how the consumption of media is changing .
increasing numbers of net users are using syndication systems so they can download episodes of the shows they like and watch them at their convenience .
many store such shows on portable media players and watch or listen on the go .
with the memory on phones growing all the time , it may not be too far in the future when that portable media device is a phone rather than an ipod .
tv could find its way to mobile phones but there are some factors that suggest the mobile operators ' dream of skies swimming with data are misplaced .
to begin with , it is unlikely that mobile users will want to download huge amounts of data while on the move .
this is simply because although 3g networks pump data around faster than ever , it is still painfully slow to download lots of data to a phone .
current pricing systems which only let people download a certain amount of data per month also mitigate against this , although these are starting to change .
for instance vodafone 's live ! service only charges for what people buy , such as a game , not to transport it to their handset .
there has been much talk of phone owners watching tv on their handsets and there are many trials of these systems in place .
however , feedback from the trials suggest that putting in place the infrastructure to let lots of people watch while they walk , along with the cost of subsidising handsets , might make it an expensive proposition for operators .
it is also not clear whether users will be able to sit and watch long tv programs while they commute .
initially coverage may be a problem and , if people are commuting , they may not be stationary for long enough to enjoy an entire episode at one time .
it is more likely that people will sign up to see clips at key moments such as when their favourite football team scores .
but if the exact future of mobile media is unclear because so many deals are being signed and technologies are being tried out , it is obvious that your phone is going to be at the centre of the storm .

business is " booming " , the uk music industry says , as talented new artists are breaking through and the public are lapping them up .
the arctic monkeys and james blunt are leading a new crop of hugely popular uk acts , selling cds at record-breaking rates .
excluding compilations , cd sales are higher than ever and albums by british artists have hit a seven-year sales peak , the industry says .
some 85 % of people buy at least one album per month , according to a recent survey of 1,000 internet users by research firm xtn data .
and legal song downloads , on which record companies and shops alike are staking their futures , more than quadrupled last year . "
it 's an exciting time to be involved with music , with consumer choice improving all the time " matt phillips british phonographic industry " the uk record industry 's continued investment in new music in recent years is paying off , " according to matt phillips , communications manager for the british phonographic industry -lrb- bpi -rrb- .
" there 's an enormous range of british talent out there that 's breaking through , as reflected in the brits shortlists .
" not only that , it 's an exciting time to be involved with music , with consumer choice improving all the time . "
ajax scott , publisher of music business bible music week , says the uk industry has been " bearing up pretty well " compared with other countries , where sales have slumped .
" that 's a basis from which the industry can look to build the digital business , " he says .
" there 's strong growth within downloads and also within the mobile space .
" what makes the situation even more healthy is that there is a lot of exciting new music , of which the arctic monkeys are the most obvious example , so there 's the talent coming through . "
cd prices are coming down all the time - the average album now costs £ 9.79 , according to the bpi .
while this is good news for consumers , it does take some of the shine off the industry 's strong sales because companies get less money for the albums they sell .
this is a big issue for high street record stores , which are also being squeezed by supermarkets and online retailers such as amazon .
uk music industry in 2005 159 million albums sold british artists accounted for 49 % of non-compilation album sales average album price £ 9.79 21 million physical singles sold 26 million songs downloaded legally source : bpi supermarkets now account for 28 % of all cd sales , the xtn data research said , and are especially successful with female customers .
" our challenge now is to evolve our business and respond to all the different changes in the marketplace to ensure that we remain relevant , " hmv spokesman gennaro castaldo says .
in the download market , more than 26 million songs were legally bought on the net in 2005 - overtaking the number of singles sold over the counter .
one in five people now use a legal music download service , according to xtn data .

the financial details have come to light after a freedom of information request by the bbc .
the hospital said although the figure was high and was a revenue , there were running costs directly associated with car parking .
swindon & marlborough nhs trust was criticised in january because of parking charges of £ 35 per day .
swindon borough council , which runs the car park on behalf of the hospital , has said the charges were in place to deter people parking there and travelling into town .
' headline grabbing ' a hospital spokesman said maintenance costs and the wages of two parking attendants also came from the fees .
trevor payne , director of estates and facilities at the trust , said : " there are a lot of costs we need to take into account .
" we have contracts with the council to enforce car parking , we have machinery and equipment that we have to purchase for the ticket issue , we 've also got lining to put down in the car park .
if there is any surplus left at the end of the year it is ploughed back into supporting the operational activity of the hospital .
trevor payne , swindon nhs trust " yes , it is a headline grabbing figure , but there are also headline grabbing costs that go with that as well .
" from my experience , i 've run a number of hospital car parking schemes and they 're in line with other schemes .
" we have benchmarks to compare costs with other schemes as well .
we 've looked at policies and procedures , and car parking at hospitals is an emotive issue , but our costs are broadly comparable . "
mr payne said the trust had an annual contract with the council to run the car park which came with two attendants .
he said it was " only right and proper " that the trust paid for that service .
" the system has been set up to cover costs .
if there is any surplus left at the end of the year it is ploughed back into supporting the operational activity of the hospital - anything from linen to patient services . "
