overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks .

as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "

he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .

in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "
but he added that the iranian president should be subjected to public criticism if he shows up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad received rebukes from around the world after denying the holocaust " if he does come and enters germany , then he will naturally be told in all clarity that what he has said is absolutely unacceptable , criminal and far removed from reality , " zwanziger told deutschlandfunk radio .
he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .
they will have to place first or second in group d , against angola , mexico and portugal , in order to stay in the competition . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's rhetoric on holocaust anger german muslims iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's remarks calling the holocaust into question have disappointed muslims in germany , who do not share his anti-semitic views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

" very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .
juniors -lrb- up to 26 years of age -rrb- pay 12 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- for a year 's membership , while family and adult memberships cost 20 euros . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .

they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings .

in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence .

" this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .

as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 solana heads to iran with package of incentives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will put a new offer on the table european union foreign policy chief javier solana was expected in tehran late monday to submit an international nuclear proposal to iran 's leadership which has already said it 's prepared to study the offer . the package , agreed on last week by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany , offers iran incentives and fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspend uranium enrichment . " mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini .

we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .
juniors -lrb- up to 26 years of age -rrb- pay 12 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- for a year 's membership , while family and adult memberships cost 20 euros . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .

it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "

he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met .

" we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .
juniors -lrb- up to 26 years of age -rrb- pay 12 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- for a year 's membership , while family and adult memberships cost 20 euros . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .
-lrb- may 8 , 2006 -rrb- new glimpses of marienburg castle marienburg castle , the seat of germany 's oldest noble dynasty , is located just 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- south of hanover , in nordstemmen .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "
but he added that the iranian president should be subjected to public criticism if he shows up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad received rebukes from around the world after denying the holocaust " if he does come and enters germany , then he will naturally be told in all clarity that what he has said is absolutely unacceptable , criminal and far removed from reality , " zwanziger told deutschlandfunk radio .
he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .

" each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks .

it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .

officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence .

solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

while some feel threatened , others welcome their presence . as twilight turns to dusk at bad godesberg 's central theater square , flocks of women cloaked from head to toe in flowing black robes gather in groups , speaking in arabic .
their faces are veiled , with just a slit for the eyes . they are virtually indistinguishable from one another , except for the shoes .
one has designer pumps on , another platform heels , and yet another is wearing sports trainers . one of them pulls out an accoutrement of the digital age - a mobile phone , which somehow seems incongruous with the abaya , the traditional saudi veil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some " women in black " in bad godesberg 's pedestrian zone but many in this slow-paced suburb of germany 's sleepy former capital said the presence of veiled women does n't mean alarm bells have to start ringing .
" these visitors might not speak any german , but their eyes are so expressive , and the laughter shines through , " said bad godesberg 's district mayor , annette schwolen-flümann , adding that more people should try to speak to and get to know the women . some are spooked other long-time residents are less thrilled about the women in black . " i feel so spooked seeing swarms of black-hooded figures , which remind me of halloween ghosts in an empty square when it 's dark outside , " said one woman , a long-time resident of bad-godesberg who did n't wish to be named .

relatively few live in bad godesberg 's former diplomatic quarters south of bonn 's city center , where magnificently restored art nouveau and victorian villas that used to be embassies and diplomatic residences grace the tree-lined boulevards . attractive medical care so why this sudden influx of veiled women ? the answer lies in bonn 's unrivalled state-of-the-art infrastructure that 's a result of the city 's former status as the federal capital . " what bad godesberg has to offer in terms of scientific research and medical facilities is extraordinary , which is why so many well-off muslim-arabs seek treatment here , " said schwolen-flümann , a member of the conservative christian democratic union .

while some feel threatened , others welcome their presence . as twilight turns to dusk at bad godesberg 's central theater square , flocks of women cloaked from head to toe in flowing black robes gather in groups , speaking in arabic .
their faces are veiled , with just a slit for the eyes . they are virtually indistinguishable from one another , except for the shoes .
one has designer pumps on , another platform heels , and yet another is wearing sports trainers . one of them pulls out an accoutrement of the digital age - a mobile phone , which somehow seems incongruous with the abaya , the traditional saudi veil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some " women in black " in bad godesberg 's pedestrian zone but many in this slow-paced suburb of germany 's sleepy former capital said the presence of veiled women does n't mean alarm bells have to start ringing .
" these visitors might not speak any german , but their eyes are so expressive , and the laughter shines through , " said bad godesberg 's district mayor , annette schwolen-flümann , adding that more people should try to speak to and get to know the women . some are spooked other long-time residents are less thrilled about the women in black . " i feel so spooked seeing swarms of black-hooded figures , which remind me of halloween ghosts in an empty square when it 's dark outside , " said one woman , a long-time resident of bad-godesberg who did n't wish to be named .

while some feel threatened , others welcome their presence . as twilight turns to dusk at bad godesberg 's central theater square , flocks of women cloaked from head to toe in flowing black robes gather in groups , speaking in arabic .
their faces are veiled , with just a slit for the eyes . they are virtually indistinguishable from one another , except for the shoes .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "
but he added that the iranian president should be subjected to public criticism if he shows up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad received rebukes from around the world after denying the holocaust " if he does come and enters germany , then he will naturally be told in all clarity that what he has said is absolutely unacceptable , criminal and far removed from reality , " zwanziger told deutschlandfunk radio .
he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .
they will have to place first or second in group d , against angola , mexico and portugal , in order to stay in the competition . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's rhetoric on holocaust anger german muslims iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's remarks calling the holocaust into question have disappointed muslims in germany , who do not share his anti-semitic views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 solana heads to iran with package of incentives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana will put a new offer on the table european union foreign policy chief javier solana was expected in tehran late monday to submit an international nuclear proposal to iran 's leadership which has already said it 's prepared to study the offer . the package , agreed on last week by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany , offers iran incentives and fresh multilateral talks - involving the united states - on the condition that iran first suspend uranium enrichment . " mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence .

the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de visit germany -pipe- 05.06.2006 german youth hostels not just for the young anymore großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostel at burg stahleck is considered one of germany 's best the locations are good , the rooms are decent and cheap , and if you 're lucky , you 'll meet some nice people .
overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .
juniors -lrb- up to 26 years of age -rrb- pay 12 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- for a year 's membership , while family and adult memberships cost 20 euros . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .

while some feel threatened , others welcome their presence . as twilight turns to dusk at bad godesberg 's central theater square , flocks of women cloaked from head to toe in flowing black robes gather in groups , speaking in arabic .
their faces are veiled , with just a slit for the eyes . they are virtually indistinguishable from one another , except for the shoes .
one has designer pumps on , another platform heels , and yet another is wearing sports trainers . one of them pulls out an accoutrement of the digital age - a mobile phone , which somehow seems incongruous with the abaya , the traditional saudi veil . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some " women in black " in bad godesberg 's pedestrian zone but many in this slow-paced suburb of germany 's sleepy former capital said the presence of veiled women does n't mean alarm bells have to start ringing .
" these visitors might not speak any german , but their eyes are so expressive , and the laughter shines through , " said bad godesberg 's district mayor , annette schwolen-flümann , adding that more people should try to speak to and get to know the women . some are spooked other long-time residents are less thrilled about the women in black . " i feel so spooked seeing swarms of black-hooded figures , which remind me of halloween ghosts in an empty square when it 's dark outside , " said one woman , a long-time resident of bad-godesberg who did n't wish to be named .

but ties to terrorist groups , including al qaeda , could not be conclusively proven . only 6 percent of all inhabitants in bonn are actually muslim and mostly of turkish or kurdish origin .
they tend to live in the working class districts to the north .
relatively few live in bad godesberg 's former diplomatic quarters south of bonn 's city center , where magnificently restored art nouveau and victorian villas that used to be embassies and diplomatic residences grace the tree-lined boulevards . attractive medical care so why this sudden influx of veiled women ? the answer lies in bonn 's unrivalled state-of-the-art infrastructure that 's a result of the city 's former status as the federal capital . " what bad godesberg has to offer in terms of scientific research and medical facilities is extraordinary , which is why so many well-off muslim-arabs seek treatment here , " said schwolen-flümann , a member of the conservative christian democratic union .
" quite a few of those veiled ladies even seek cosmetic surgery . " the reha-klinik or rehabilitation center , for instance , has attracted top specialists in neurological care .
the overwhelming majority of patients from abroad come from the oil-rich gulf states , where it is customary for women to be completely veiled in black , according to munir abdalla , who is in charge of medical services for foreign patients at the clinic . " some patients are sheiks or princes , and they bring their entire entourage , " said abdalla , who is a german of palestinian origin .
" others are ordinary citizens from kuwait , qatar or saudi arabia , who can afford the best treatment , since all medical and travel costs , plus accommodation for accompanying family members are paid for by the individual states .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .
juniors -lrb- up to 26 years of age -rrb- pay 12 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- for a year 's membership , while family and adult memberships cost 20 euros . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de giving shelter to soccer fans instead of sending soccer fans to the family tree to look for long-lost german relatives with a free room , a number of internet sites are connecting fans to thousands of empty guest beds and extra sofas in german homes .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "
but he added that the iranian president should be subjected to public criticism if he shows up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad received rebukes from around the world after denying the holocaust " if he does come and enters germany , then he will naturally be told in all clarity that what he has said is absolutely unacceptable , criminal and far removed from reality , " zwanziger told deutschlandfunk radio .
he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .

it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .

" what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .
i have said very clearly at the last meeting on friday that this is something that we have to present to the iranian people and government . " us sweetens deal but diplomats told news agency afp that the united states has moved to sweeten the offer to iran by offering to lift some of its trade sanctions . the united states is proposing " lifting sanctions partially , not only waiving sanctions but actually lifting them , " in an agreement to be worked out in multilateral talks that would start once iran suspended uranium enrichment , a senior western diplomat said in vienna . washington , which considers iran a sponsor of terrorism and now fears it is covertly developing nuclear weapons , has since the mid-1990s banned most us trade and investment with the islamic republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state condoleezza rice has signaled the us may be willing to budge lifting sanctions would allow sales to iran of things like agricultural technology and commercial planes to replace the country 's dilapidated fleet .
us officials have said they want to keep the details of the proposal secret in order to avoid the appearance of threatening iran . iran maintains defiant stance but a string of tough comments from iranian officials have signaled that the offer could prove to be dead on arrival . on saturday , president mahmoud ahmadinejad revealed that in a telephone conversation earlier saturday with un secretary general kofi annan , he had been asked " to examine the proposals and not act hastily . " " i said that we will not act hastily and that we will examine the proposals , " ahmadinejad said . but the president has also ruled out halting enrichment , saying that " negotiating our absolute right would be like accepting to negotiate on our independence . " iran 's supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said sunday that his country would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khameini said iran would not give in under pressure " we have achieved a lot of scientific goals , " khamenei said in a speech marking the 17th anniversary of the death of iran 's islamic revolutionary leader , ayatollah ruhollah khomeini . " this is an historic investment .
it represents our political independence and national self confidence .
we should not sell out this precious resource because of the enemies ' threats and we should not be fooled by enemy bribes , " he said . solana promises aid to palestinians earlier on monday solana paid a visit to the west bank , telling palestinians that the eu will not let them down .
solana expressed hope that a special aid fund that would bypass hamas would be in place by early next month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas , right , with solana " the palestinian people can be assured that the eu will not let them down and we will continue to support them as much as we can , " solana told a joint news conference with palestinian authority president mahmud abbas . " the amount of money which will be spent in the year 2006 will be more than that spent in 2005 , " he added in the west bank town of ramallah .
the european union - the biggest aid donor to the palestinians - and the united states both suspended funding after militant islamic group hamas won january elections , while israel has also blocked the transfer of revenues . to avoid palestinian financial meltdown , however , the eu , russia , un and us are working on setting up a world bank fund to channel money to palestinians without it passing through the hamas-led government . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's supreme leader : " using nuclear weapons is un-islamic " iran 's supreme leader on sunday rejected international demands that his country suspend sensitive nuclear work , vowing the islamic republic would not buckle in the face of " threats and bribes .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

the head of germany 's soccer association , however , said he would get an earful . the german government would deal with the issue if it actually becomes one , a foreign ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency . president mahmoud ahmadinejad has reaped international criticism for repeatedly denying the holocaust and questioning israel 's right to exist .
german chancellor angela merkel has called his comments intolerable . in effect , there is no way germany could realistically prevent ahmadinejad from visiting the country , the ministry spokesman suggested . as a head of state , he does n't need a visa to enter germany .
his visit could only be blocked if the un passed a resolution requiring member states to do so , the spokesman said .
even then , ahmadinejad could declare himself a member of the iranian team , which germany guaranteed free entry , he added .
tough opponents theo zwanziger , head of germany 's dfb soccer association , said on sunday he opposed banning ahmadinejad from the competition because that would " make him a martyr . "
but he added that the iranian president should be subjected to public criticism if he shows up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad received rebukes from around the world after denying the holocaust " if he does come and enters germany , then he will naturally be told in all clarity that what he has said is absolutely unacceptable , criminal and far removed from reality , " zwanziger told deutschlandfunk radio .
he added that one could not greet someone who refuses to recognize the reality of the holocaust . at a reception for the iranian soccer team in tehran on saturday , ahmadinejad announced he would come to germany if the players made it through the preliminary round of the world cup .
for months there have been conflicting reports about whether he would actually attend the tournament .
just last week a government spokesman said he would not . on sunday , the iranian team arrived in friedrichshagen on lake constance , where they will be staying for the world cup .
they will have to place first or second in group d , against angola , mexico and portugal , in order to stay in the competition . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's rhetoric on holocaust anger german muslims iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's remarks calling the holocaust into question have disappointed muslims in germany , who do not share his anti-semitic views .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.06.2006 eu fails to agree on eu " safe " country list großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stricter immigration controls has become a priority of the eu in an effort to streamline asylum policy , the eu has been considering creating a list of " safe " countries from which to exclude asylum seekers .
the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday .

" mr solana will arrive in tehran tonight , " a source close to the visit said .
official sources indicated he was likely to hand the proposal to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad on tuesday . " very , very soon i will be going to tehran , " solana said at a press conference in the west bank town of ramallah earlier on monday . iran agrees to study offer iran 's uranium enrichment program is at the centre of fears the country could make nuclear weapons .
the country has so far refused to suspend enrichment , arguing such fuel cycle work is for peaceful purposes only and is therefore a right enshrined by the non-proliferation treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad has offered to study the offer but the islamic republic 's leadership has nevertheless agreed to study the offer of trade , security and technology benefits . iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki said monday the a deal was possible but only if iran 's " demands " were met . " if their aim is not to politicise the issue and if they take our demands into consideration , we can reach a reasonable agreement , " mottaki told reporters . mottaki said solana would hand the proposal - drawn up by britain , france and germany , and backed by the united states , russia and china - to top iranian national security official ali larijani on tuesday . " we advise our european friends not to make the same errors as last year and not to take decisions without taking into account the positions of the islamic republic , " mottaki added , referring to a previous eu offer of incentives in exchange for a freeze on sensitive nuclear work . the latest offer from the six world powers is accompanied by a threat of robust un security council action - including possible sanctions - if iran fails to halt enrichment . when asked to give details of the offer , solana said : " i can not answer this .

overnighting in germany 's youth hostels is extremely popular , and not just among the young . " each bed consists of a sack tightly stuffed with straw , a pillow , two bed sheets and a wool blanket " - that 's how teacher richard schirrmann envisioned a possible " stopping place for the wander-happy youth of germany " almost 100 years ago .
on an eight-day hike with his class , he himself had had to seek out shelter with an accommodating farmer , or spend the night with his charges in an empty village school .
out of this experience , he developed the idea of the youth hostel . several years separated the birth of the idea and its realization .
but in 1912 , the world 's first dedicated youth hostel opened in the altena castle in germany 's hilly sauerland region .
the facility was purpose-built : two dormitories with solid three-storey bunk beds , a sitting room , kitchen , showers and bathrooms .
the hostels of today have come a long way from that first spartan concept , and in addition to smaller rooms also offer entertainment and educational programs designed with children and young adults in mind . unusual locations over the years , many hostels have set themselves apart by focusing on special areas .
the individual profiles vary as much as the actual buildings . " in rostock , the youth hostel is part of the local meteorological station , and in konstanz , there 's one in a former water tower , " said knut dinter of the german youth hostel association , naming just two examples of unusual settings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pillow fight was held to mark the re-opening of the renovated hostel in stuttgart while in the 1980s , youth hostels were more or less synonymous with school trips , eventually , hostels began focusing more on families , developing special offers to attract this target group .
in addition to branching out their customer bases , this also solved the problem of empty youth hostels during the school vacation periods .
in recent years , hostels have also begun developing programs to attract clubs and associations , who can have seminars or meetings and combine them with leisure activities . appealing to international guests according to dinter , the latest initiative on the part of german hostels is aimed at attracting a more international clientele . " the individual backpacker is the focus , " he said , adding that staff members are being trained so that they can welcome guests in english or french , as well as german . with almost 600 youth hostels nationwide and 1.7 million members , germany has a vast hostelling network .
membership is obligatory to take advantage of the facilities , but it 's not expensive .

the problem is that they ca n't decide which ones to select . when the justice and interior ministers of the 25-members of the eu came together in late may , a continuing debate over asylum policy was again on the agenda .
they were hoping , this time , to come to a decision over which countries should be designated as " safe countries of origin " for asylum seekers - countries from which illegal immigrants ' claims would be automatically dismissed and sent back under a fast-track procedure . the problem is that the european commission ca n't agree if countries such as mali , where women still live under the threat of female genital mutilation , should be placed on such a list .
the same holds true for countries such as benin , botswana , ghana , mauritius , senegal and cape verde , some of which ban homosexuality or still have the death penalty .
they are all included in a draft proposal by eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
also , some officials complained that only african countries are on the list . as a result , the ministers have postponed the decision again for a few weeks . " we are going to review and integrate -lrb- the draft -rrb- not only with africa but with countries from other continents , " frattini told reporters .
preve n ti n g immigra n ts from " shoppi n g " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish are pushing for help in preventing illegals from reaching their territory in december , the eu approved a new law that will create a common policy toward immigrants and asylum seekers .
it aims to prevent " shopping " by immigrants for countries with more lax rules in which they file multiple applications in numerous countries .
officials hope the law will also streamline and fast-track procedures for deportation . part of the push for the new initiative was a call from spain , which has had to contend with thousands of illegal migrants recently : hundreds stormed the border around the spanish enclaves of melilla and ceuta in morocco last fall ; 7,000 others have been trying over the past months to reach the spanish canary islands by boat in order to gain asylum .
as a result , the spanish and other countries want their eu colleagues to agree to share the burden regarding illegal immigrants and refugees . agreeing on the list has been the major stumbling block and not just within the commission .
for example , the european parliament opposed countries from north africa such as morocco or libya from being placed on the list because of human rights concerns . huma n rights groups outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner frattini says the list will still let refugees from " safe " countries in human rights advocates say that the new law and a resulting list is no solution and that there is really no alternative to examining each asylum claim individually . " the list is a mechanism that is not provided for in international human rights law , " said julia duchrow of amnesty international . other opponents say it politicizes asylum policy too much . " what countries are on that list is essentially a political decision , " said anja klug of the un high commissioner for refugees .
" there is no mechanism that can truly guarantee whether a country is really safe and how much so . " another problem is that many refugees come via a " third country " and can be returned there .
as a result , some might be deported to countries deemed " safe " which truly are n't , critics say . but frattini said that a list will not rule out asylum claims from any so-called safe countries if refugees face " individual persecution and risk . " there is no contradiction between a safe list and granting refugee status to someone from one of those countries , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu interior ministers propose european test for foreigners interior ministers of six eu nations are weighing the possiblity of an " integration contract " with immigrants as well as improving pan european collaboration in the fight against terrorism and illegal migration .

all four welsh police forces launch a summer crackdown on monday on people who go behind the wheel after drinking .
last year a similar campaign found almost a third of drivers stopped were over the drink-drive limit .
in a joint statement , the forces said : " make this a summer to remember for all the right reasons , not to regret for all the wrong ones . "
north wales police is the lead force in this summer 's anti-drink-drive campaign .
superintendent geraint anwyl , head of the force 's operational support division , said drivers could expect the likelihood of being stopped by the police during this time to increase .
he said : " any amount of alcohol or drugs in the body can affect a person 's driving ability and judgment .
" despite previous campaigns , people are still being killed or seriously injured as a direct result of this reckless practice .
" it is a major concern that in the 2005 campaign 10 % to 31 % of young drivers between the age of 17 and 25 tested positive for driving whilst under the influence of alcohol or drugs . "
the campaign will be launched at queens square in wrexham .
chief inspector phil davies , for dyfed powys police , said : " drink or drug driving is an all year problem and those who drink or drug-drive should be under no illusion as to the extent of the police commitment to detecting and prosecuting drink drivers .
" we will continue to enforce the drink-driving law firmly and without favour in an attempt to reduce the death toll even further and to continue the success of this campaign . "

results show that women who switched to the drug exemestane , after taking tamoxifen for two to three years , reduced their risk of cancer returning .
the research showed that their survival rates also improved .
consultant oncologist at belfast city hospital dr seamus mcaleer said that the results of the research were " very encouraging " .
" this is the first study that has shown an actual improvement in survival .
that is actually quite important , " he said .
" there will be more women alive in the long term after they switched to exemestane than if they had stayed with tamoxifen . "
he said that for women who were past the menopause , where these drugs were effective , this combination " not only reduces the risk of relapse , it also gives a very significant improvement in survival in the longer term " .
dr mcaleer said that in northern ireland this particular pattern of drug taking had been already recommended to patients over the past year .
however , he pointed out that the drugs only worked with hormone sensitive tumours and in post-menopausal women .

however , there is one element of the tournament that is not proving so popular in the conservative town , and that is nuremberg 's role as the national promoter of modern art during the tournament .
the city has installed a sculpture by artist olaf metzel that has covered up one of the city 's most-loved landmarks , the schoener brunnen , or beautiful fountain , with a double-helix of 780 chairs removed from berlin 's olympic stadium .
any worries about potential football hooligans coming from england - they play trinidad & tobago in nuremberg - have been overshadowed by the fountain row .
locals fear the treatment of one of its favourite tourist spots means the city will not be shown off in its best light .
' auf wiedersehen ' nuremberg citizens have been up in arms at the work by munich artist olaf metzel and have been leaving notes and pictures of protest pinned to the artworks ' outer fencing .
the 17m-tall sculpture is called auf wiedersehen and is one of several sculptures by contemporary artists commissioned across the region for the world cup .
metzel enclosed the beautiful fountain in a sculpture made from stadium seats , creating a dynamic and aggressive confrontation between venues of ' high ' and ' low ' culture das grosse rasenstueck flyer the plan to cover up the fountain - built in 1385 - for six weeks has been causing a storm of debate in nuremberg , with the local paper receiving 600 letters in protest , and a smaller number in favour .
regina weckstroem besser , a guide with the bundesverband der gaestefuehrer deutschland visitor organisation , said : " every day there is controversy about this work of art .
" the football authorities wanted one of the host venue cities to be a centre for modern art , and nuremberg was accepted for this . "
the fountain as it usually is seen the 400,000-euro project - called the large piece of turf -lrb- das grosse rasenstueck -rrb- - is co-organised by the city of nuremberg and the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the city says it is a chance for nuremberg to host a series of " spectacular as well as rather pensive , quiet works , forming an unusual contrast to the homely medieval backdrop of the city " .
other works include a series of large-sized outdoor photographs , showing football goals in different social settings .
explaining the meaning behind the fountain work , a city guide says : " metzel enclosed the beautiful fountain in a sculpture made from stadium seats , creating a dynamic and aggressive confrontation between venues of ' high ' and ' low ' culture . "
however , it appears that nurembergers want their homely city back as it was , at least as far as the fountain is concerned .
' show off fountain ' andreas franke , a journalist at the nuernberger nachrichten newspaper , said : " the old fountain is part of the heart of nuremberg .
the schoener brunnen means " beautiful fountain " in english located in the hauptmarkt erected in 1385 a gothic church spire design pyramid with 40 figures figures include seven imperial electors medieval heroes , philosophers and evangelists also figured replaced with replica in early 20th century " with so many guests coming from germany and other parts of the world , people wanted to be able to show off the fountain to visitors , and explain the history of the city .
" now it will remain covered over until after the world cup .
another problem is that people say they had not been given any prior warning about what was going to happen . "
he adds : " our newspaper has carried hundreds of letters on this issue , with the majority against the artwork . "
fountain ' rediscovered ' but those who support the piece point out that in fact the fountain as it stands does not contain a single original stone , with just a few original soft sandstone fragments now kept in the germanisches nationalmuseum .
" and this is supposed to be the beautiful fountain ? " asks the duke the present limestone copy was built between 1897 and 1902 .
and mrs weckstroem besser says : " when people get their fountain back again they will see it in a different way .
" i think it is quite a good idea .
after being covered up , then the people can discover their fountain again . "
however , for now , most nuremberg citizens are waiting eagerly for 10 july , the day after the world cup final , so they can say their own auf wiedersehen to the artwork .
until then , the beautiful game will continue to deprive them of their beautiful fountain .

with life having moved on and much of the oil now used up , what can the country call its greatest resource this decade ?
well , maybe dragons den provides part of the answer .
it 's not oil we are sitting on .
it 's huge underground reserves of untapped ideas .
who would have known that there were so many people with high hopes , detailed plans and grand visions ?
dragons den - and its imitators - have uncovered a movement that had rarely engaged the public , and had only been a minority interest in the business community .
this movement is important not just for the welfare of entrepreneurs , but for the economy generally .
britain needs to manufacture ideas every bit as successfully as it used to manufacture textiles or automobiles in earlier eras .
new opportunities for old why ?
because the world economy has evolved significantly in the last decade , and there is simply far more competition in making toys , clothes , electronics or furniture these days .
the returns that british companies and their workers can earn by manufacturing " things " have fallen ; the prices of these goods have been driven down as factory jobs and investment have been outsourced to china and the rest of asia where labour costs are low .
so britain has to find something else to do .
and for economies like ours , the most attractive returns are usually to be found in more lucrative activities like management , business services , and best of all , innovation .
paying our way which is where entrepreneurs come in .
they are one of the all-important sources of new ideas we have and the companies they create are the means by which ideas are turned into value .
their companies can turn a profit , they can grow and prosper and they may eventually be sold .
whatever path success takes , it is one of the ways our economy pays its way in the world . "
failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour " truman capote indeed , the business headlines at the moment are dominated by foreign takeovers of british companies .
investors in the uk are apparently doing well as foreign buyers bid up the prices of british shares .
the higher share prices apparently help us all , by funding future pensions .
creative destruction for real long-term success though , britain needs not just to sell off one generation of good companies , but to ensure that it constantly creates more new companies and more value .
alas , that is not easy .
just as it was difficult to get oil out of the north sea - oil companies expect to strike lucky in a tenth of the sites they explore - it is equally difficult to find ideas that have value and entrepreneurs that have management skill .
for every spectacular success , there will be quite a few failures .
so the process of creating an entrepreneurial economy is inevitably messy and sometimes brutal .
as truman capote once said : " failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour . "
the only ways of uncovering successful ideas are to trawl for them widely , to encourage people to develop them , to test and critique them , and to support when they look like they have something .
which is more or less what dragons den is all about .
it could play its part in stimulating a more innovative economy .
and the good news is , it makes for much more entertaining television than anything to do with north sea oil .

does britain need more people prepared to brave the dragon 's den ?
with life having moved on and much of the oil now used up , what can the country call its greatest resource this decade ?
well , maybe dragons den provides part of the answer .
it 's not oil we are sitting on .
it 's huge underground reserves of untapped ideas .
who would have known that there were so many people with high hopes , detailed plans and grand visions ?
dragons den - and its imitators - have uncovered a movement that had rarely engaged the public , and had only been a minority interest in the business community .
this movement is important not just for the welfare of entrepreneurs , but for the economy generally .
britain needs to manufacture ideas every bit as successfully as it used to manufacture textiles or automobiles in earlier eras .
new opportunities for old why ?
because the world economy has evolved significantly in the last decade , and there is simply far more competition in making toys , clothes , electronics or furniture these days .
the returns that british companies and their workers can earn by manufacturing " things " have fallen ; the prices of these goods have been driven down as factory jobs and investment have been outsourced to china and the rest of asia where labour costs are low .
so britain has to find something else to do .
and for economies like ours , the most attractive returns are usually to be found in more lucrative activities like management , business services , and best of all , innovation .
paying our way which is where entrepreneurs come in .
they are one of the all-important sources of new ideas we have and the companies they create are the means by which ideas are turned into value .
their companies can turn a profit , they can grow and prosper and they may eventually be sold .
whatever path success takes , it is one of the ways our economy pays its way in the world .
failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour truman capote indeed , the business headlines at the moment are dominated by foreign takeovers of british companies .
investors in the uk are apparently doing well as foreign buyers bid up the prices of british shares .
the higher share prices apparently help us all , by funding future pensions .
creative destruction for real long-term success though , britain needs not just to sell off one generation of good companies , but to ensure that it constantly creates more new companies and more value .
alas , that is not easy .
just as it was difficult to get oil out of the north sea - oil companies expect to strike lucky in a tenth of the sites they explore - it is equally difficult to find ideas that have value and entrepreneurs that have management skill .
for every spectacular success , there will be quite a few failures .
so the process of creating an entrepreneurial economy is inevitably messy and sometimes brutal .
as truman capote once said : " failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour . "
the only ways of uncovering successful ideas are to trawl for them widely , to encourage people to develop them , to test and critique them , and to support when they look like they have something .
which is more or less what dragons den is all about .
it could play its part in stimulating a more innovative economy .
and the good news is , it makes for much more entertaining television than anything to do with north sea oil .

at least 30 england football anthems are flooding the music market , with all of them making a bid to take the number one spot .
six of the leading contenders - including the football association 's official england world cup song - are detailed here .
click on the links below to read more about them and listen to the songs .
1 .
embrace - world at your feet huddersfield indie rock band embrace were handed the task of recording the official england world cup song .
singer danny mcnamara said he was " very , very nervous " when he unveiled world at your feet in april .
he said the lyric , " you 're the first in my life to make me think that we might just go all the way , " was inspired by a team he thought had " every chance " of winning the world cup .
but some critics have given the song a lukewarm response , saying it lacks the gumption to become an anthem to inspire chanting from the terraces .
sham 69 frontman jimmy pursey , who has also recorded a world cup song , has branded embrace 's effort as " embarrassing " .
2 .
tony christie - -lrb- is this the way to -rrb- the world cup the veteran crooner has reworked -lrb- is this the way to -rrb- amarillo , which topped the charts last year in aid of comic relief and revitalised christie 's career .
bbc radio 1 dj chris moyles urged christie to record the song after receiving a demo from ian stringer and george webley , the bbc three counties radio presenters who wrote the new lyrics .
christie says the original has been a terrace chant in germany for years , and hopes england fans will reclaim it with the new version .
whether the singer can turn this version into another hit single remains to be seen - his subsequent efforts to capitalise on the success of amarillo have proved less fruitful .
3 .
sham 69 - hurry up england punk band sham 69 have reworked their 1978 hit hurry up harry , with ex-blur guitarist graham coxon joining to form sham 69 & the special assembly .
virgin radio listeners voted the song the " people 's anthem " to accompany england 's world cup bid .
singer jimmy pursey said he found embrace 's effort uninspiring : " as a football fan supporting england i 'm not roused by it .
the unofficial songs are always better than the official ones and this year is no exception . "
hurry up england will reach the top of the charts " if the people want it to " , according to musician pursey .
4 .
crazy frog - we are the champions -lrb- ding a dang dong -rrb- the love-him-or-loathe-him amphibian has given the 1977 queen classic we are the champions a world cup twist .
crazy frog 's axel f kept coldplay 's speed of sound off the top of the uk singles chart last year , with the popular ringtone spending four weeks at number one .
his crazy hits album went on to sell 150,000 copies in the uk , to be followed later this year by more crazy hits .
but the character 's chart-topping magic faltered with an assault on the christmas chart last year - his version of jingle bells landed at number five .
5 .
tonedef allstars - who do you think you are kidding jurgen klinsmann ?
the theme tune to the classic sitcom dad 's army has been reworked as a lighthearted challenge to germany coach jurgen klinsmann .
with vocals by 1966 world cup winners sir geoff hurst and martin peters , ex-boxer frank bruno and dad 's army star bill pertwee , it won a competition in the sun newspaper to find an alternative world cup anthem .
they have since been championing the song , while embrace singer danny mcnamara recently told the newspaper it was " brilliant " and likely to beat them to number one .
the single describes england boss sven-goran eriksson as the " swedish master " - but will the accolade prove justifed ? 6 .
joe fagin - that 's england alright the former frontman of 1960s merseybeat band the strangers has reworked his solo hit that 's livin ' alright , which was the theme tune of television series auf wiedersehen , pet .
joe fagin says the new version with its world cup twist " captures the spirit of the true england fan " .
its early , bold lyrical claim " we 're gonna beat them all out of sight " , is later tempered with the more realistic acknowledgment : " with a little luck , we could win the world cup . "
other chart stars of years gone by who are making a bid for world cup chart glory include showaddywaddy , while neil and christine hamilton have also thrown their hat into a very crowded ring .

david burrowes , from the right-wing cornerstone group of conservative mps , said local champions proved more popular with voters .
tories in winnable seats are being urged to choose candidates from a list of 100 elite candidates .
the list includes former soap star adam rickitt and author louise bagshawe .
' working locally ' mr burrowes told bbc radio 4 's today programme the party should not try too hard to choose candidates in london and " parachute " them into constituencies .
he said : " what we need is much more effort on local determination , a wider choice of people , whether it be from the voluntary sector , people championing social justice issues , and issues we 're all concerned about .
" but it has to be much more of that local dimension , with all that experience that comes from being a local champion for people .
" that 's what people want .
they do n't so much want a celebrity or someone who 's a beautiful person - they want someone who is going to be working hard locally , for the benefit of all . "
mr burrowes , who secured the biggest swing to the tories when he won enfield at last year 's election , has examined 70 seats .
he found that the biggest factors in winning over votes were choosing candidates early , selecting local people , fighting professional , well-run campaigns , and targeting areas outside tory " heartlands " .
' national job ' cornerstone group chairman john hayes said putting candidates with little local knowledge into key seats was " the bizarre theory of people who spend too much time with the pseuds and posers of london 's chichi set and not enough time in normal britain " .
but former conservative mp and television personality gyles brandreth said being a minor celebrity had helped him win press attention and " stand out from the crowd " when he was first elected .
he argued : " there is a kind of obsession , though , among the local activists about being local .
" and they maybe forget that the job of a member of parliament is not to actually be in your constituency but to represent your constituency in parliament .
" you are a member of parliament , it is a national job . "
the first test of the a-list , which is part of mr cameron 's efforts to make the candidates more representative , will come at the by-election caused by the death of mp eric forth .
but party officials have indicated that bromley and chislehurst tories will be able to choose a local candidate .
and tory chairman francis maude has assured local associations that the leadership is not trying to foist " mincing metrosexuals " on to " gritty northern " seats .

david burrowes , from the right-wing cornerstone group of conservative mps , said local champions proved more popular with voters .
tories in winnable seats are being urged to choose candidates from a list of 100 elite candidates .
the list includes former soap star adam rickitt and author louise bagshawe .
' working locally ' mr burrowes told bbc radio 4 's today programme the party should not try too hard to choose candidates in london and " parachute " them into constituencies .
he said : " what we need is much more effort on local determination , a wider choice of people , whether it be from the voluntary sector , people championing social justice issues , and issues we 're all concerned about .
" but it has to be much more of that local dimension , with all that experience that comes from being a local champion for people .
" that 's what people want .
they do n't so much want a celebrity or someone who 's a beautiful person - they want someone who is going to be working hard locally , for the benefit of all . "
mr burrowes , who secured the biggest swing to the tories when he won enfield at last year 's election , has examined 70 seats .
he found that the biggest factors in winning over votes were choosing candidates early , selecting local people , fighting professional , well-run campaigns , and targeting areas outside tory " heartlands " .
' national job ' cornerstone group chairman john hayes said putting candidates with little local knowledge into key seats was " the bizarre theory of people who spend too much time with the pseuds and posers of london 's chichi set and not enough time in normal britain " .
but former conservative mp and television personality gyles brandreth said being a minor celebrity had helped him win press attention and " stand out from the crowd " when he was first elected .
he argued : " there is a kind of obsession , though , among the local activists about being local .
" and they maybe forget that the job of a member of parliament is not to actually be in your constituency but to represent your constituency in parliament .
" you are a member of parliament , it is a national job . "
the first test of the a-list , which is part of mr cameron 's efforts to make the candidates more representative , will come at the by-election caused by the death of mp eric forth .

the first is an update of horror classic the omen , in which farrow plays a nanny who dotes on her charge damien , the devil incarnate .
mia farrow shot to stardom 38 years ago when she played the lead role in roman polanski 's rosemary 's baby , a horror film about a woman who discovers her pregnancy is part of a satanic ritual .
but farrow says that rosemary 's baby was not on her mind when irish director john moore asked her to play the evil mrs baylock in the omen .
mixed feelings " john moore called me up and gave me some really compelling reasons for re-making the omen , which i recall as being a very scary and good movie .
and then i said ' why me ? ' , remembering the great billie whitelaw and how she played this role .
john said that she was great but he wanted it to be more subtle , " farrow says .
in addition to the omen , the actress will soon appear in romantic comedy fast track and director luc besson 's latest film , arthur and the minimoys .
farrow can spend more time filming now her children are grown up farrow seems to have mixed feelings about spending more time on movie sets and less time in her connecticut farmhouse .
" as of next september , there will only be one child living at home .
everybody is all grown up , so i can take the time to do things that are interesting to me .
" it 's been challenging , it 's been fun , it 's been rewarding , but they are growing up now so i have more time , " she says .
farrow 's decision to spend most of the last decade caring for her children and taking only a few small film and television parts , stands in stark contrast to the life her ex-partner woody allen has chosen .
the couple split 14 years ago when a scandal erupted involving allen and soon-yi previn , one of farrow 's many adopted children .
now in his seventies , allen continues to make a film every year without fail .
he and previn married in 1997 and have two adopted daughters .
woody allen was farrow 's partner for over a decade last year on us programme the insider , farrow described allen as difficult .
" he was my boyfriend , but also my boss .
he was very particular about what he ate and how things looked .
he was not a man that wanted to share everything .
" he did n't want to share a bathroom , for example .
we built him a bathroom in this house in the country and it was ' woody 's bathroom . '
" we wanted to please him and it was n't so easy .
in the end , maybe he 's not someone who can be pleased , " she said .
farrow must now introduce herself to a generation of movie-goers who are perhaps familiar with her personal life but not her acting .
charity work " i guess the new audience , my kids ' generation , are astute moviegoers .
i hope they like all three of these films , " says the actress .
farrow is also keen to stress that despite the fact that she is acting again , she will carry on working as a goodwill ambassador for unicef .
she suffered from polio as a child and now campaigns to fight the disease in developing nations , including sudan .
she sees the omen not only as entertainment but as a lesson on human nature and even international affairs .
" i think the underlying message of the omen is the same as rosemary 's baby , in a sense the duality of human nature is that we are capable of great goodness and altruism .
" we have to look no further than the darfur region of sudan to see the other aspect of human nature , capable of terrible things . "
the worldwide release of the omen is on 6 june .

the first is an update of horror classic the omen , in which farrow plays a nanny who dotes on her charge damien , the devil incarnate .
mia farrow shot to stardom 38 years ago when she played the lead role in roman polanski 's rosemary 's baby , a horror film about a woman who discovers her pregnancy is part of a satanic ritual .
but farrow says that rosemary 's baby was not on her mind when irish director john moore asked her to play the evil mrs baylock in the omen .
mixed feelings " john moore called me up and gave me some really compelling reasons for re-making the omen , which i recall as being a very scary and good movie .
and then i said ' why me ? ' , remembering the great billie whitelaw and how she played this role .
john said that she was great but he wanted it to be more subtle , " farrow says .
in addition to the omen , the actress will soon appear in romantic comedy fast track and director luc besson 's latest film , arthur and the minimoys .
farrow can spend more time filming now her children are grown up farrow seems to have mixed feelings about spending more time on movie sets and less time in her connecticut farmhouse .
" as of next september , there will only be one child living at home .
everybody is all grown up , so i can take the time to do things that are interesting to me .
" it 's been challenging , it 's been fun , it 's been rewarding , but they are growing up now so i have more time , " she says .
farrow 's decision to spend most of the last decade caring for her children and taking only a few small film and television parts , stands in stark contrast to the life her ex-partner woody allen has chosen .
the couple split 14 years ago when a scandal erupted involving allen and soon-yi previn , one of farrow 's many adopted children .
now in his seventies , allen continues to make a film every year without fail .
he and previn married in 1997 and have two adopted daughters .
woody allen was farrow 's partner for over a decade last year on us programme the insider , farrow described allen as difficult .
" he was my boyfriend , but also my boss .
he was very particular about what he ate and how things looked .
he was not a man that wanted to share everything .
" he did n't want to share a bathroom , for example .
we built him a bathroom in this house in the country and it was ' woody 's bathroom . '
" we wanted to please him and it was n't so easy .
in the end , maybe he 's not someone who can be pleased , " she said .
farrow must now introduce herself to a generation of movie-goers who are perhaps familiar with her personal life but not her acting .
charity work " i guess the new audience , my kids ' generation , are astute moviegoers .
i hope they like all three of these films , " says the actress .

thirteen badgers have been killed on the route between nairn and inverness since january .
charity scottish badgers said talks had been held about giving the animals a safer way of crossing one section of the road .
he said a tunnel at a roundabout built as part of a £ 4m road linking the a96 to inverness airport was an option .
two badgers have been killed on the nairn side of the roundabout in the past month .
our purpose is to collect data to identify hot spots and , if there is remedial road work being done , to talk about helping the badgers ian hutchison scottish badgers ian hutchison , scottish badgers development and education officer , said the charity was also in talks with scottish executive , scottish natural heritage and highland council about assessing the potential impact on badgers from two other major developments planned for the area .
one is a proposed new village of 5,000 homes between nairn and inverness and the other plans to dual carriageway the a96 between the highland capital and airport .
mr hutchison said : " we are in discussions with the scottish executive and highland council about a tunnel at the roundabout for that section of road . "
hundreds of badgers are killed each year along the length of the a96 he added : " the executive is quite open to suggestions about helping badgers .
" we are not expecting councils or the executive to start digging up existing roads .
" our purpose is to collect data to identify hot spots and , if there is remedial road work being done , to talk about helping the badgers . "
mr hutchison said badgers were frequently knocked down on the a96 where it passed tornagrain , gollanfield and culloden .
in the last five years , 154 animals have been killed on the highland stretch of the road .
over the same period , 386 badgers have been killed across the whole of the highlands .

it was the first time the world was alerted to what would later become known as aids - acquired immune deficiency syndrome , caused by hiv .
the research was published in morbidity and mortality weekly report , a journal published by the centers for disease control .
in the early 1980s , dr jim curran reviewed the paper before its publication and was made head of the cdc 's taskforce to investigate the cases at the same time .
the paper detailed how five gay men , aged between 29 and 36 , had been treated for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia , a previously rare lung infection between october 1980 to may 1981 .
however , it is now known that the organism which caused the disease is pneumocystis jiroveci .
the fact that these patients were all homosexuals suggests an association between some aspect of a homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through sexual contact and pneumocystis pneumonia morbidity and mortality weekly report paper timeline : significant dates the emergence of aids the five men also had cytomegalovirus -lrb- cmv -rrb- , a form of herpes which is harmless to most people but which has since been found to problematic in those with hiv because they can not fight off the infection .
two of the men had already died by the time the paper was published .
an editorial note in the journal stated : " pneumocystis pneumonia in the us is almost exclusively limited to immunosuppressed patients .
" the occurrence of pneumocystosis in these five previously healthy individuals without a clinically apparent underlying immunodeficiency is unusual .
" the fact that these patients were all homosexuals suggests an association between some aspect of a homosexual lifestyle or disease acquired through sexual contact and pneumocystis pneumonia in this population . "
' common exposure ' the paper also said all five men had either had cmv disease or had shown signs of having the disease in the preceding months .
it said other research published earlier that year had found high rates of cmv among homosexual men , but not among heterosexual men of the same age .
a further study had found semen had tested positive for cmv in men whose urine had shown no sign of the virus .

"
it added : " the above observations suggest the possibility of a cellular-immune dysfunction related to a common exposure that predisposes individuals to opportunistic infections . "
' passionate campaigners ' dr curran told the bbc news website : " the paper was clearly important in terms of newness and severity .
but the extent of the significance was clearly unknown .
our leading hypothesis from day one was that an underlying virus could be the cause of the epidemic dr jim curran , formerly of the centers for disease control " our leading hypothesis from day one was that an underlying virus could be the cause of the epidemic .
" but it could have been an alteration of a current virus or a new one .
" it was n't until cases were diagnosed in people with haemophilia around the summer of 1982 that there was uniform acceptance of the viral hypothesis .
" the paper 's importance was incompletely recognised by politicians and the general public until it was proven to be transmitted through blood .
" but there were several passionate scientists , physicians and public advocates in and outside government . "
' i saw him die ' the same issue of mmrw reported an unusually high number of cases of kaposi 's sarcoma , a rare type of cancer that develops from skin cells .
twenty-six homosexual men under 50 - 20 in new york and six in california - had been diagnosed with the cancer in the preceding 30 months .
that compared three cases in one new york hospital between 1961 and 1979 .
it was later discovered that aids increases the risk of the cancer because of its effects on the immune system .
dr curran was asked to meet a young gay man with kaposi 's sarcoma a week after the article was published who was of the same age and who had had a virtually identical life to him .
" i got to know him and watched his health decline over the next several months , and saw him eventually die .
" i realised that it was a virus that really separated us and a virus that none of us could have known about .
i 've thought about that many , many times since then . "
dr curran , now dean of the rollins school of public health at emory university in atlanta , georgia , added : " twenty-five years seems like a long time in one sense but i can say that the time has gone by in a heartbeat .
" and i 'm amazed at the scientific progress and the progress of many of the people who work to prevent the disease .

currently , five years of treatment with tamoxifen is viewed as the " gold-standard " treatment for postmenopausal women with breast cancer .

the intergroup exemestane study -lrb- ies -rrb- examined 2,352 postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer who switched to aromasin after two to three years of tamoxifen treatment .
they were compared with another group of 2,372 women treated with tamoxifen alone for about five years .
women given aromasin , which has the generic name exemestane , had a 15 % lower risk of dying than those restricted to tamoxifen .
when only women with hormone-sensitive cancers were included , the improvement rose to 17 % .
safe and effective lead researcher professor raoul coombes , from imperial college london , said : " these results show that switching to exemestane after two to three years of tamoxifen is safe and can improve the cure rate in postmenopausal women with breast cancer . "
as well as improving survival , switching to aromasin cut the risk of cancer spreading by 17 % and lowered the rate of tumours appearing in the opposite breast by 44 % .
professor timothy cooke , a breast cancer specialist at glasgow royal infirmary , said it was possible that two years of treatment with tamoxifen softened up cancer cells , so they were more vulnerable to the effects of aromatase inhibitors .
the ies trial was co-ordinated by the charity cancer research uk .
professor john toy , the charity 's medical director , said : " this is very encouraging but we must continue to follow the health of the women in the trial in order to secure long-term conclusions . "
jeremy hughes , chief executive of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said : " this sounds like excellent news for women with breast cancer .

women given aromasin , which has the generic name exemestane , had a 15 % lower risk of dying than those restricted to tamoxifen .
when only women with hormone-sensitive cancers were included , the improvement rose to 17 % .
safe and effective lead researcher professor raoul coombes , from imperial college london , said : " these results show that switching to exemestane after two to three years of tamoxifen is safe and can improve the cure rate in postmenopausal women with breast cancer . "
as well as improving survival , switching to aromasin cut the risk of cancer spreading by 17 % and lowered the rate of tumours appearing in the opposite breast by 44 % .
professor timothy cooke , a breast cancer specialist at glasgow royal infirmary , said it was possible that two years of treatment with tamoxifen softened up cancer cells , so they were more vulnerable to the effects of aromatase inhibitors .
the ies trial was co-ordinated by the charity cancer research uk .
professor john toy , the charity 's medical director , said : " this is very encouraging but we must continue to follow the health of the women in the trial in order to secure long-term conclusions . "
jeremy hughes , chief executive of the charity breakthrough breast cancer , said : " this sounds like excellent news for women with breast cancer .
" women tell us that a choice of treatment is increasingly important , particularly as all drugs have some side effects which can impact their quality of life .
" results from clinical trials like this further support nice 's preliminary recommendation for the use of aromasin and other aromatase inhibitors in early breast cancer . "

the applications at duns and eyemouth are part of a £ 60m public private partnership for the region which also includes earlston high school .
a number of concerns have been expressed by the public about the proposals for the two schools .
planning officers are recommending the go ahead for both projects with a number of conditions .
a new site on land south of gunsgreen park in eyemouth has been selected for the school .
that scheme would include sports pitches and an all-weather facility .
there will also be an associated wind turbine to help cut energy costs .
some reservations have been expressed locally , with residents concerned about noise , light pollution and litter problems .
they are also worried that the proposed parking provision might not be adequate .
planning officials are recommending the project for approval although they have added 15 conditions which they want councillors to impose .
these include landscaping , planting and footpath details .
at duns it is proposed the replacement for the existing berwickshire high school should be built on a site across the road .
there are still concerns about the low-lying nature of the site and berwickshire civic society oppose the scheme .
they claim the new school building will detract from the appearance of the existing berwickshire high which is of listed status .
planning officials are again recommending approval with a list of conditions .
if they get the go-ahead it is hoped that all three new schools could open by august 2008 .

most drugs sold as viagra in china are counterfeit , and the ruling shows the country is prepared to get tougher on intellectual property rights violation .
in 2004 , china 's patent review board sided with chinese generic drug makers challenging pfizer 's sildenafil citrate patent , viagra 's main ingredient .
new york-based pfizer recorded viagra sales of $ 1.65bn -lrb- £ 0.87bn -rrb- in 2005 .
an official at the beijing no 1 intermediate people 's court confirmed the decision .
pfizer had appealed to china 's state intellectual property office -lrb- sipo -rrb- over the 2004 decision by the patent review board permitting more than a dozen chinese drug firms to use sildenafil citrate .
' great brother ' viagra was introduced in china six years ago and after six months on the market , state media said 90 % of the blue pills sold in shanghai were fake .
viagra is known locally as " weige " or " great brother " in chinese .
the local producers , known as the " weige alliance " , are expected to appeal against the latest decision .
" we respect the chinese law and the decision made by the court .
but we may appeal , " said qing liang , a spokesman for guangzhou baiyunshan pharmaceutical , a firm looking to market a generic version of viagra .
when it joined the world trade organization in 2001 , china agreed to tighten patent protections .

the move follows the death of a woman rider whose horse bolted when a helicopter flew overhead .
heather bell , 38 , was killed after her horse was startled by a twin-rotor chinook near market rasen in lincolnshire , in june 2003 .
the first of the jackets are being handed out at gleneagles , perthshire .
an inquest into the death of mrs bell , who had only been riding for a few months , made several recommendations , including the use of high-visibility clothing to help air crews spot riders .
' essential operations ' the initiative , set up jointly between the air force and the british horse society , will see 400 sets of high-visibility clothing given to horse riders .
it was introduced following mod trials last year at raf benson , in oxfordshire .
under secretary of state for defence tom watson said it was essential for pilots to be trained in low-flying techniques for operations which included rebuilding work in iraq and afghanistan and search and rescue capabilities in the uk .
" we recognise that there is the potential for our training in the uk to cause disturbance to members of the public , particularly the riding community , " he said .
heather bell died after suffering head injuries " we have reduced our training requirements to the minimum necessary to produce fully-trained forces but we are committed to taking forward safety issues wherever possible . "
mr watson added : " we hope that this initiative will encourage other riders to use high-visibility equipment .
not only is it effective in improving rider safety from the air , but it can also increase rider safety on the roads . "
graham cory , chief executive of the british horse society , said the key message of the high-visibility clothing trials was that a horse and rider who could be seen in good time could be avoided in good time .
he said : " properly attired riders and horses were visible in plenty of time for the pilots to take appropriate evasive action .
" those which were not so attired were invisible until the very last moment . "
after mrs bell 's death , a telephone helpline was also set up to provide horse riders with information about helicopter movements .
riders have been asked to apply for the high-visibility jackets through the british horse society .
