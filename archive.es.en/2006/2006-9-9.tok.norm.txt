" it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .

" i wanted to see again the places and the people i grew up with and which shaped me and formed my life , and to thank those people , " the pope said in an interview with german television ahead of the visit . benedict , known as a vatican hardliner before he became pope , said he also wanted to help convince german believers whose faith was wavering that catholicism was more than just a set of rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict gave interviews to german broadcasters including deutsche welle , earlier this month " we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , " he said . he explained he was reluctant to travel often , saying he had " never felt strong enough " to plan many long trips . " but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go . " benedict has visited poland and spain in recent months and plans to go to turkey in november and to brazil in 2007 . rush of converts not expected the election of a german pope has been credited with slowing the flow of people leaving the catholic faith in the country , but the current archbishop of munich , cardinal friedrich wetter , said he did not foresee a rush of converts as a result of the papal visit . " i am not expecting that there will now be a mass of people going to church , " the cardinal told saturday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily . " but why should n't we just have a good event that strengthens people and shows them they are not alone in their beliefs ?

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .

many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

" but the penalization process has been stopped , " a beaming steinbrück said .
he added that berlin would present new figures on its budget deficit to the eu commission in october . " happy about the praise " the eu commission , which polices public finances in the 25-member bloc , recommended in july this year not to continue with deficit proceedings against germany . according to eu finance ministers , the german government has taken all the steps needed to lower by 2007 its budget deficit below the 3 percent ceiling laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
eu officials in brussels earlier this week welcomed steinbrück 's statement that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year - meeting eurozone demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is a relieved man steinbrück reiterated he was optimistic that germany would rein in its budget deficit to uphold the 3 percent ceiling this year . " we 're very happy about the praise and recognition and - i 'm not going to shy away from saying it - also about the compliments for the fact that germany will be below the 3-percent ceiling this year , " steinbrück said . if germany did indeed manage to lower its deficit , it would be the first time since 2001 . germany has violated the pact every year since 2002 and has been under fire by the eu since jan .
2003 when the commission opened deficit proceedings against it in jan .

but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.09.2006 german cup : dreams up for grabs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive dfb cup is up for grabs again - even for your typical soccer fan rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .
but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .
that team would go on to win the champions league against valencia . such a possibility makes domestic cup competitions around europe popular and shows that minnows stocked with students , bank tellers , and carpenters can sometimes swallow the big clubs . songs written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer 's match-fixing is also part of cup history the stages for the contests against amateur clubs all take place in grounds that at times resemble high school stadiums more than the glamour of top-flight european soccer .
one-time tasks must be accomplished without any hitches .
camera teams from german public television must be catered to , extra rooms for doping tests set up , even coaching boxes . " it was n't clear to us that the planning would take on such dimensions , " said gerd olbrich , chair of fifth-division side tsg thannhausen , which are welcoming six-time german champions borrusia dortmund . the club 's board may be dealing with the formalities demanded from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , but the massive support from the 6,629 residents of the tiny south bavarian community is evident .
they have written a song to irritate the visitors and their 800 supporters traveling from the north , who traditionally wear black-and-yellow .
even the band 's name is supposed to intimidate dortmund - " the hornets from mars " . grass cut for free bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadiums like this one in hoffenheim are standard for the cup emotions before these matches do run high but the teams must also think of more earthly things - like cutting the grass .
the amateurs from bremerhaven must have forgotten that before playing schalke last year or could n't afford to cut it .
or they thought it would be to their advantage . then , booting the ball forward in the air was mandatory .
the grass was so long that shots on the ground rolled harmlessly to the goalkeeper .
and attempts to dribble the ball ended with it advancing a few feet before the dribbler unwittingly stumbled over it .
nevertheless , the royal blues managed to overcome the vexing problem and won 3-0 . the club westfalia herne , not located far from the schalke city of gelsenkirchen , has received the generous support of the city which mowed the grass to a playable height for free . the german cup is a chance for weekend warriors to stand face-to-face , and tread boot-to-boot against international stars .
seldom does it come to a second game for teams like pirmasens -lrb- they play bremen -rrb- or rossbach -lrb- they face mönchengladbach -rrb- .
but probably in every locker room of the 28 amateur clubs participating in this season 's cup , the words " fc magdeburg " will be written on the chalkboard to remind the players that dreams do occasionally come true . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .

" but the penalization process has been stopped , " a beaming steinbrück said .
he added that berlin would present new figures on its budget deficit to the eu commission in october . " happy about the praise " the eu commission , which polices public finances in the 25-member bloc , recommended in july this year not to continue with deficit proceedings against germany . according to eu finance ministers , the german government has taken all the steps needed to lower by 2007 its budget deficit below the 3 percent ceiling laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
eu officials in brussels earlier this week welcomed steinbrück 's statement that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year - meeting eurozone demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is a relieved man steinbrück reiterated he was optimistic that germany would rein in its budget deficit to uphold the 3 percent ceiling this year . " we 're very happy about the praise and recognition and - i 'm not going to shy away from saying it - also about the compliments for the fact that germany will be below the 3-percent ceiling this year , " steinbrück said . if germany did indeed manage to lower its deficit , it would be the first time since 2001 . germany has violated the pact every year since 2002 and has been under fire by the eu since jan .
2003 when the commission opened deficit proceedings against it in jan .
2003 . other key eurozone countries , including france and italy , have also been reprimanded by the eu for not respecting the bloc 's fiscal rules . excessive deficit action by the eu carries the risk of countries being slapped with hefty fines . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .
“ my opinion changed once i started reading his books .
i really like his language .
he speaks directly to the heart . ” the verjans family , who had driven six hours from the town of mönchengladbach , was equally thrilled to get close to benedict . “ it ’ s great , we haven ’ t seen him before , ” said 11-year-old christine verjans , who said she was passing the time with her 10-year-old brother , bernhard , by playing tag , watching people and giving interviews to journalists .
“ it ’ s great fun even though it ’ ll still take so long before he comes . ” back at the information booth , boy scout christian pröhl said he wasn ’ t too upset that he would not be able to see the pope in munich as his shift went until 8 p.m. “ we ’ re going to see him in freising , ” he said , referring to the pope ’ s final stop of his trip next thursday .
“ it ’ s cool that the pope is from bavaria .
if he ’ d been from somewhere else , i wouldn ’ t really have cared that much . ” mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope returns home for trip down memory lane pope benedict xvi is to arrive in bavaria on saturday to start a six-day homecoming pilgrimage to the southern region of germany where he was born .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

deutsche welle and the beethoven festival have invited south africa 's best young musicians to germany .
their concert saturday will be broadcast live . beethoven meets russia and south africa - in germany ?
it might sound like a strange combination , but that 's exactly what the city of bonn will be witnessing on saturday , sept .
9 . the musicians from the south african national youth orchestra -lrb- sanyo -rrb- arrived this week in bonn and are tuning up for their much awaited performance saturday under the direction of conductor conrad van alphen . the orchestra 's diverse program , including beethoven 's famed fifth symphony , a new work composed by hans huyssen and commissioned by deutsche welle , and a set of eight songs by a zulu princess , will be broadcast live to the musicians ' home country . it does n't matter that the festival 's actual theme this year is " rossija . "
after all , sanyo is no stranger to cultural diversity . music breaks down barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen spent time teaching the orchestra his piece " we try to incorporate as many different cultures as possible in our organization , " said sanyo 's manager faan malan .
there are 11 languages and numerous different cultures in south africa and the youth orchestra tries to use music as a means of unification , he added . the orchestra directors hold country-wide auditions to select around 80 of the best musicians each year .
they 're also involved in numerous initiatives that promote music education in traditionally disadvantaged communities and aim to make the orchestra " elite " only in the musical - not the social - sense . " about 20 percent of the orchestra members come from disadvantaged backgrounds , " said malan . d for diversity - of people and flowers fostering cultural diversity in a country once split by apartheid is the kernel of hans huyssen 's new work " proteus variations . "
the south african born composer chose the protea , his country 's national flower , as a symbol for the rich variety of both plants and cultures there . " on one hand , the work is fully african because it was written in africa and is performed by an african orchestra , but sanyo is a western orchestra and plays western music in a western style .
there are certainly african elements in the piece , but they have been ' translated ' for a western audience , " said huyssen , humming a few of the native melodies he integrated into the work . huyssen has german grandparents and studied cello and composition in both europe and africa .
he has also immersed himself in african music and transcribed a great deal of it . festival breaks new ground with african guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen took south africa 's national flower as a symbol for cultural diversity huyssen 's work may incorporate a few african elements , but another piece on saturday 's program will be performed in an african language - zulu . the eight " princess magogo songs " were composed by one of africa 's most well-known composers , princess magogo -lrb- 1900-1984 -rrb- , who was the daughter of the zulu king dinuzulu . " it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .
the young musicians are staying in bonn with host families before they continue on to berlin for a workshop with renowned conductor herbert blomstedt at the berlin philharmonic . live broadcast to south africa each year , deutsche welle sponsors a young orchestra during the beethoven festival and commissions a work by a composer from that country .
since its initiation in 2001 , musicians from kiev , istanbul , tbilisi , beijing , and krakow have participated in the project . sanyo 's concert , which will be performed saturday at 8:00 p.m.

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .

many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .

" the existence of such prisons is not compatible with my understanding of the rule of law .
even in the fight against terrorism ... the ends do not justify the means , " merkel said in berlin on saturday .
" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations . " highly questionable " the revelation has also added weight to a report by the council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's main human rights watchdog and independent from the eu , which said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . bush 's public admission has prompted renewed calls by european lawmakers that their governments divulge the locations of the secret cia prisons . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble also condemned the detentions . " i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

" the existence of such prisons is not compatible with my understanding of the rule of law .
even in the fight against terrorism ... the ends do not justify the means , " merkel said in berlin on saturday .
" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations . " highly questionable " the revelation has also added weight to a report by the council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's main human rights watchdog and independent from the eu , which said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . bush 's public admission has prompted renewed calls by european lawmakers that their governments divulge the locations of the secret cia prisons . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble also condemned the detentions . " i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

the pope has set aside wednesday to spend with his brother in regensburg and together they will visit the graves of their mother , father and sister . " i wanted to see again the places and the people i grew up with and which shaped me and formed my life , and to thank those people , " the pope said in an interview with german television ahead of the visit . benedict , known as a vatican hardliner before he became pope , said he also wanted to help convince german believers whose faith was wavering that catholicism was more than just a set of rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict gave interviews to german broadcasters including deutsche welle , earlier this month " we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , " he said . he explained he was reluctant to travel often , saying he had " never felt strong enough " to plan many long trips . " but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go . " benedict has visited poland and spain in recent months and plans to go to turkey in november and to brazil in 2007 . rush of converts not expected the election of a german pope has been credited with slowing the flow of people leaving the catholic faith in the country , but the current archbishop of munich , cardinal friedrich wetter , said he did not foresee a rush of converts as a result of the papal visit . " i am not expecting that there will now be a mass of people going to church , " the cardinal told saturday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily . " but why should n't we just have a good event that strengthens people and shows them they are not alone in their beliefs ? " in returning to bavaria , the pope is honoring the stronghold of catholicism in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.09.2006 hamburg 's new star striker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanogo celebrates after scoring against hertha berlin he may not get the press of bremen 's miroslav klose or bayern munich 's roy makaay , but hamburg striker boubacar sanogo has quietly become one of the top strikers in germany . the 23-year-old from the ivory coast has found the net more often than anyone else in the bundesliga 's young season with three goals in three games .
having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.09.2006 hamburg 's new star striker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sanogo celebrates after scoring against hertha berlin he may not get the press of bremen 's miroslav klose or bayern munich 's roy makaay , but hamburg striker boubacar sanogo has quietly become one of the top strikers in germany . the 23-year-old from the ivory coast has found the net more often than anyone else in the bundesliga 's young season with three goals in three games .
having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

the pope has set aside wednesday to spend with his brother in regensburg and together they will visit the graves of their mother , father and sister . " i wanted to see again the places and the people i grew up with and which shaped me and formed my life , and to thank those people , " the pope said in an interview with german television ahead of the visit . benedict , known as a vatican hardliner before he became pope , said he also wanted to help convince german believers whose faith was wavering that catholicism was more than just a set of rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict gave interviews to german broadcasters including deutsche welle , earlier this month " we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , " he said . he explained he was reluctant to travel often , saying he had " never felt strong enough " to plan many long trips . " but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go . " benedict has visited poland and spain in recent months and plans to go to turkey in november and to brazil in 2007 . rush of converts not expected the election of a german pope has been credited with slowing the flow of people leaving the catholic faith in the country , but the current archbishop of munich , cardinal friedrich wetter , said he did not foresee a rush of converts as a result of the papal visit . " i am not expecting that there will now be a mass of people going to church , " the cardinal told saturday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily . " but why should n't we just have a good event that strengthens people and shows them they are not alone in their beliefs ?

" the existence of such prisons is not compatible with my understanding of the rule of law .
even in the fight against terrorism ... the ends do not justify the means , " merkel said in berlin on saturday .
" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations .

" i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

their concert saturday will be broadcast live . beethoven meets russia and south africa - in germany ?
it might sound like a strange combination , but that 's exactly what the city of bonn will be witnessing on saturday , sept .
9 . the musicians from the south african national youth orchestra -lrb- sanyo -rrb- arrived this week in bonn and are tuning up for their much awaited performance saturday under the direction of conductor conrad van alphen . the orchestra 's diverse program , including beethoven 's famed fifth symphony , a new work composed by hans huyssen and commissioned by deutsche welle , and a set of eight songs by a zulu princess , will be broadcast live to the musicians ' home country . it does n't matter that the festival 's actual theme this year is " rossija . "
after all , sanyo is no stranger to cultural diversity . music breaks down barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen spent time teaching the orchestra his piece " we try to incorporate as many different cultures as possible in our organization , " said sanyo 's manager faan malan .
there are 11 languages and numerous different cultures in south africa and the youth orchestra tries to use music as a means of unification , he added . the orchestra directors hold country-wide auditions to select around 80 of the best musicians each year .
they 're also involved in numerous initiatives that promote music education in traditionally disadvantaged communities and aim to make the orchestra " elite " only in the musical - not the social - sense . " about 20 percent of the orchestra members come from disadvantaged backgrounds , " said malan . d for diversity - of people and flowers fostering cultural diversity in a country once split by apartheid is the kernel of hans huyssen 's new work " proteus variations . "
the south african born composer chose the protea , his country 's national flower , as a symbol for the rich variety of both plants and cultures there . " on one hand , the work is fully african because it was written in africa and is performed by an african orchestra , but sanyo is a western orchestra and plays western music in a western style .
there are certainly african elements in the piece , but they have been ' translated ' for a western audience , " said huyssen , humming a few of the native melodies he integrated into the work . huyssen has german grandparents and studied cello and composition in both europe and africa .
he has also immersed himself in african music and transcribed a great deal of it . festival breaks new ground with african guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen took south africa 's national flower as a symbol for cultural diversity huyssen 's work may incorporate a few african elements , but another piece on saturday 's program will be performed in an african language - zulu . the eight " princess magogo songs " were composed by one of africa 's most well-known composers , princess magogo -lrb- 1900-1984 -rrb- , who was the daughter of the zulu king dinuzulu . " it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .
the young musicians are staying in bonn with host families before they continue on to berlin for a workshop with renowned conductor herbert blomstedt at the berlin philharmonic . live broadcast to south africa each year , deutsche welle sponsors a young orchestra during the beethoven festival and commissions a work by a composer from that country .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

deutsche welle and the beethoven festival have invited south africa 's best young musicians to germany .
their concert saturday will be broadcast live . beethoven meets russia and south africa - in germany ?
it might sound like a strange combination , but that 's exactly what the city of bonn will be witnessing on saturday , sept .
9 . the musicians from the south african national youth orchestra -lrb- sanyo -rrb- arrived this week in bonn and are tuning up for their much awaited performance saturday under the direction of conductor conrad van alphen . the orchestra 's diverse program , including beethoven 's famed fifth symphony , a new work composed by hans huyssen and commissioned by deutsche welle , and a set of eight songs by a zulu princess , will be broadcast live to the musicians ' home country . it does n't matter that the festival 's actual theme this year is " rossija . "
after all , sanyo is no stranger to cultural diversity . music breaks down barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen spent time teaching the orchestra his piece " we try to incorporate as many different cultures as possible in our organization , " said sanyo 's manager faan malan .
there are 11 languages and numerous different cultures in south africa and the youth orchestra tries to use music as a means of unification , he added . the orchestra directors hold country-wide auditions to select around 80 of the best musicians each year .
they 're also involved in numerous initiatives that promote music education in traditionally disadvantaged communities and aim to make the orchestra " elite " only in the musical - not the social - sense . " about 20 percent of the orchestra members come from disadvantaged backgrounds , " said malan . d for diversity - of people and flowers fostering cultural diversity in a country once split by apartheid is the kernel of hans huyssen 's new work " proteus variations . "
the south african born composer chose the protea , his country 's national flower , as a symbol for the rich variety of both plants and cultures there . " on one hand , the work is fully african because it was written in africa and is performed by an african orchestra , but sanyo is a western orchestra and plays western music in a western style .
there are certainly african elements in the piece , but they have been ' translated ' for a western audience , " said huyssen , humming a few of the native melodies he integrated into the work . huyssen has german grandparents and studied cello and composition in both europe and africa .
he has also immersed himself in african music and transcribed a great deal of it . festival breaks new ground with african guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen took south africa 's national flower as a symbol for cultural diversity huyssen 's work may incorporate a few african elements , but another piece on saturday 's program will be performed in an african language - zulu . the eight " princess magogo songs " were composed by one of africa 's most well-known composers , princess magogo -lrb- 1900-1984 -rrb- , who was the daughter of the zulu king dinuzulu . " it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .
the young musicians are staying in bonn with host families before they continue on to berlin for a workshop with renowned conductor herbert blomstedt at the berlin philharmonic . live broadcast to south africa each year , deutsche welle sponsors a young orchestra during the beethoven festival and commissions a work by a composer from that country .
since its initiation in 2001 , musicians from kiev , istanbul , tbilisi , beijing , and krakow have participated in the project . sanyo 's concert , which will be performed saturday at 8:00 p.m.

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .
but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream .

" the existence of such prisons is not compatible with my understanding of the rule of law .
even in the fight against terrorism ... the ends do not justify the means , " merkel said in berlin on saturday .
" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations . " highly questionable " the revelation has also added weight to a report by the council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's main human rights watchdog and independent from the eu , which said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . bush 's public admission has prompted renewed calls by european lawmakers that their governments divulge the locations of the secret cia prisons . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble also condemned the detentions . " i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .
“ my opinion changed once i started reading his books .
i really like his language .
he speaks directly to the heart . ” the verjans family , who had driven six hours from the town of mönchengladbach , was equally thrilled to get close to benedict . “ it ’ s great , we haven ’ t seen him before , ” said 11-year-old christine verjans , who said she was passing the time with her 10-year-old brother , bernhard , by playing tag , watching people and giving interviews to journalists .
“ it ’ s great fun even though it ’ ll still take so long before he comes . ” back at the information booth , boy scout christian pröhl said he wasn ’ t too upset that he would not be able to see the pope in munich as his shift went until 8 p.m. “ we ’ re going to see him in freising , ” he said , referring to the pope ’ s final stop of his trip next thursday .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .
“ my opinion changed once i started reading his books .
i really like his language .
he speaks directly to the heart . ” the verjans family , who had driven six hours from the town of mönchengladbach , was equally thrilled to get close to benedict . “ it ’ s great , we haven ’ t seen him before , ” said 11-year-old christine verjans , who said she was passing the time with her 10-year-old brother , bernhard , by playing tag , watching people and giving interviews to journalists .
“ it ’ s great fun even though it ’ ll still take so long before he comes . ” back at the information booth , boy scout christian pröhl said he wasn ’ t too upset that he would not be able to see the pope in munich as his shift went until 8 p.m. “ we ’ re going to see him in freising , ” he said , referring to the pope ’ s final stop of his trip next thursday .

" but the penalization process has been stopped , " a beaming steinbrück said .
he added that berlin would present new figures on its budget deficit to the eu commission in october . " happy about the praise " the eu commission , which polices public finances in the 25-member bloc , recommended in july this year not to continue with deficit proceedings against germany . according to eu finance ministers , the german government has taken all the steps needed to lower by 2007 its budget deficit below the 3 percent ceiling laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
eu officials in brussels earlier this week welcomed steinbrück 's statement that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year - meeting eurozone demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is a relieved man steinbrück reiterated he was optimistic that germany would rein in its budget deficit to uphold the 3 percent ceiling this year . " we 're very happy about the praise and recognition and - i 'm not going to shy away from saying it - also about the compliments for the fact that germany will be below the 3-percent ceiling this year , " steinbrück said . if germany did indeed manage to lower its deficit , it would be the first time since 2001 . germany has violated the pact every year since 2002 and has been under fire by the eu since jan .
2003 when the commission opened deficit proceedings against it in jan .
2003 . other key eurozone countries , including france and italy , have also been reprimanded by the eu for not respecting the bloc 's fiscal rules . excessive deficit action by the eu carries the risk of countries being slapped with hefty fines . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .
that team would go on to win the champions league against valencia . such a possibility makes domestic cup competitions around europe popular and shows that minnows stocked with students , bank tellers , and carpenters can sometimes swallow the big clubs . songs written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer 's match-fixing is also part of cup history the stages for the contests against amateur clubs all take place in grounds that at times resemble high school stadiums more than the glamour of top-flight european soccer .
one-time tasks must be accomplished without any hitches .
camera teams from german public television must be catered to , extra rooms for doping tests set up , even coaching boxes . " it was n't clear to us that the planning would take on such dimensions , " said gerd olbrich , chair of fifth-division side tsg thannhausen , which are welcoming six-time german champions borrusia dortmund . the club 's board may be dealing with the formalities demanded from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , but the massive support from the 6,629 residents of the tiny south bavarian community is evident .
they have written a song to irritate the visitors and their 800 supporters traveling from the north , who traditionally wear black-and-yellow .
even the band 's name is supposed to intimidate dortmund - " the hornets from mars " . grass cut for free bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadiums like this one in hoffenheim are standard for the cup emotions before these matches do run high but the teams must also think of more earthly things - like cutting the grass .
the amateurs from bremerhaven must have forgotten that before playing schalke last year or could n't afford to cut it .
or they thought it would be to their advantage . then , booting the ball forward in the air was mandatory .
the grass was so long that shots on the ground rolled harmlessly to the goalkeeper .
and attempts to dribble the ball ended with it advancing a few feet before the dribbler unwittingly stumbled over it .
nevertheless , the royal blues managed to overcome the vexing problem and won 3-0 . the club westfalia herne , not located far from the schalke city of gelsenkirchen , has received the generous support of the city which mowed the grass to a playable height for free . the german cup is a chance for weekend warriors to stand face-to-face , and tread boot-to-boot against international stars .
seldom does it come to a second game for teams like pirmasens -lrb- they play bremen -rrb- or rossbach -lrb- they face mönchengladbach -rrb- .
but probably in every locker room of the 28 amateur clubs participating in this season 's cup , the words " fc magdeburg " will be written on the chalkboard to remind the players that dreams do occasionally come true . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .

the pope has set aside wednesday to spend with his brother in regensburg and together they will visit the graves of their mother , father and sister . " i wanted to see again the places and the people i grew up with and which shaped me and formed my life , and to thank those people , " the pope said in an interview with german television ahead of the visit . benedict , known as a vatican hardliner before he became pope , said he also wanted to help convince german believers whose faith was wavering that catholicism was more than just a set of rules . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict gave interviews to german broadcasters including deutsche welle , earlier this month " we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , " he said . he explained he was reluctant to travel often , saying he had " never felt strong enough " to plan many long trips . " but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go . " benedict has visited poland and spain in recent months and plans to go to turkey in november and to brazil in 2007 . rush of converts not expected the election of a german pope has been credited with slowing the flow of people leaving the catholic faith in the country , but the current archbishop of munich , cardinal friedrich wetter , said he did not foresee a rush of converts as a result of the papal visit . " i am not expecting that there will now be a mass of people going to church , " the cardinal told saturday 's süddeutsche zeitung daily .

" but the penalization process has been stopped , " a beaming steinbrück said .
he added that berlin would present new figures on its budget deficit to the eu commission in october . " happy about the praise " the eu commission , which polices public finances in the 25-member bloc , recommended in july this year not to continue with deficit proceedings against germany . according to eu finance ministers , the german government has taken all the steps needed to lower by 2007 its budget deficit below the 3 percent ceiling laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact .
eu officials in brussels earlier this week welcomed steinbrück 's statement that the german budget deficit would stand at 2.8 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year - meeting eurozone demands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is a relieved man steinbrück reiterated he was optimistic that germany would rein in its budget deficit to uphold the 3 percent ceiling this year . " we 're very happy about the praise and recognition and - i 'm not going to shy away from saying it - also about the compliments for the fact that germany will be below the 3-percent ceiling this year , " steinbrück said . if germany did indeed manage to lower its deficit , it would be the first time since 2001 . germany has violated the pact every year since 2002 and has been under fire by the eu since jan .
2003 when the commission opened deficit proceedings against it in jan .
2003 . other key eurozone countries , including france and italy , have also been reprimanded by the eu for not respecting the bloc 's fiscal rules . excessive deficit action by the eu carries the risk of countries being slapped with hefty fines . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de minister : germany to meet eu deficit rules in 2007 for the first time in four years , germany 's annual budget is set keep the public deficit under the three percent limit set by the european union 's growth and stability pact , finance minister peer steinbrück said tuesday .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .

many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .

" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .

" it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .

but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .
that team would go on to win the champions league against valencia . such a possibility makes domestic cup competitions around europe popular and shows that minnows stocked with students , bank tellers , and carpenters can sometimes swallow the big clubs . songs written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer 's match-fixing is also part of cup history the stages for the contests against amateur clubs all take place in grounds that at times resemble high school stadiums more than the glamour of top-flight european soccer .
one-time tasks must be accomplished without any hitches .
camera teams from german public television must be catered to , extra rooms for doping tests set up , even coaching boxes . " it was n't clear to us that the planning would take on such dimensions , " said gerd olbrich , chair of fifth-division side tsg thannhausen , which are welcoming six-time german champions borrusia dortmund . the club 's board may be dealing with the formalities demanded from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , but the massive support from the 6,629 residents of the tiny south bavarian community is evident .
they have written a song to irritate the visitors and their 800 supporters traveling from the north , who traditionally wear black-and-yellow .
even the band 's name is supposed to intimidate dortmund - " the hornets from mars " . grass cut for free bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadiums like this one in hoffenheim are standard for the cup emotions before these matches do run high but the teams must also think of more earthly things - like cutting the grass .
the amateurs from bremerhaven must have forgotten that before playing schalke last year or could n't afford to cut it .
or they thought it would be to their advantage . then , booting the ball forward in the air was mandatory .
the grass was so long that shots on the ground rolled harmlessly to the goalkeeper .
and attempts to dribble the ball ended with it advancing a few feet before the dribbler unwittingly stumbled over it .
nevertheless , the royal blues managed to overcome the vexing problem and won 3-0 . the club westfalia herne , not located far from the schalke city of gelsenkirchen , has received the generous support of the city which mowed the grass to a playable height for free . the german cup is a chance for weekend warriors to stand face-to-face , and tread boot-to-boot against international stars .
seldom does it come to a second game for teams like pirmasens -lrb- they play bremen -rrb- or rossbach -lrb- they face mönchengladbach -rrb- .
but probably in every locker room of the 28 amateur clubs participating in this season 's cup , the words " fc magdeburg " will be written on the chalkboard to remind the players that dreams do occasionally come true . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .
the win puts bayern on course for an historic league and cup double .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.09.2006 german cup : dreams up for grabs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive dfb cup is up for grabs again - even for your typical soccer fan rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .
but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .
that team would go on to win the champions league against valencia . such a possibility makes domestic cup competitions around europe popular and shows that minnows stocked with students , bank tellers , and carpenters can sometimes swallow the big clubs . songs written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer 's match-fixing is also part of cup history the stages for the contests against amateur clubs all take place in grounds that at times resemble high school stadiums more than the glamour of top-flight european soccer .
one-time tasks must be accomplished without any hitches .
camera teams from german public television must be catered to , extra rooms for doping tests set up , even coaching boxes . " it was n't clear to us that the planning would take on such dimensions , " said gerd olbrich , chair of fifth-division side tsg thannhausen , which are welcoming six-time german champions borrusia dortmund . the club 's board may be dealing with the formalities demanded from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , but the massive support from the 6,629 residents of the tiny south bavarian community is evident .
they have written a song to irritate the visitors and their 800 supporters traveling from the north , who traditionally wear black-and-yellow .

deutsche welle and the beethoven festival have invited south africa 's best young musicians to germany .
their concert saturday will be broadcast live . beethoven meets russia and south africa - in germany ?
it might sound like a strange combination , but that 's exactly what the city of bonn will be witnessing on saturday , sept .
9 . the musicians from the south african national youth orchestra -lrb- sanyo -rrb- arrived this week in bonn and are tuning up for their much awaited performance saturday under the direction of conductor conrad van alphen . the orchestra 's diverse program , including beethoven 's famed fifth symphony , a new work composed by hans huyssen and commissioned by deutsche welle , and a set of eight songs by a zulu princess , will be broadcast live to the musicians ' home country . it does n't matter that the festival 's actual theme this year is " rossija . "
after all , sanyo is no stranger to cultural diversity . music breaks down barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen spent time teaching the orchestra his piece " we try to incorporate as many different cultures as possible in our organization , " said sanyo 's manager faan malan .
there are 11 languages and numerous different cultures in south africa and the youth orchestra tries to use music as a means of unification , he added . the orchestra directors hold country-wide auditions to select around 80 of the best musicians each year .
they 're also involved in numerous initiatives that promote music education in traditionally disadvantaged communities and aim to make the orchestra " elite " only in the musical - not the social - sense . " about 20 percent of the orchestra members come from disadvantaged backgrounds , " said malan . d for diversity - of people and flowers fostering cultural diversity in a country once split by apartheid is the kernel of hans huyssen 's new work " proteus variations . "
the south african born composer chose the protea , his country 's national flower , as a symbol for the rich variety of both plants and cultures there . " on one hand , the work is fully african because it was written in africa and is performed by an african orchestra , but sanyo is a western orchestra and plays western music in a western style .
there are certainly african elements in the piece , but they have been ' translated ' for a western audience , " said huyssen , humming a few of the native melodies he integrated into the work . huyssen has german grandparents and studied cello and composition in both europe and africa .
he has also immersed himself in african music and transcribed a great deal of it . festival breaks new ground with african guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen took south africa 's national flower as a symbol for cultural diversity huyssen 's work may incorporate a few african elements , but another piece on saturday 's program will be performed in an african language - zulu . the eight " princess magogo songs " were composed by one of africa 's most well-known composers , princess magogo -lrb- 1900-1984 -rrb- , who was the daughter of the zulu king dinuzulu . " it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .
the young musicians are staying in bonn with host families before they continue on to berlin for a workshop with renowned conductor herbert blomstedt at the berlin philharmonic . live broadcast to south africa each year , deutsche welle sponsors a young orchestra during the beethoven festival and commissions a work by a composer from that country .
since its initiation in 2001 , musicians from kiev , istanbul , tbilisi , beijing , and krakow have participated in the project . sanyo 's concert , which will be performed saturday at 8:00 p.m.

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .
“ my opinion changed once i started reading his books .
i really like his language .
he speaks directly to the heart . ” the verjans family , who had driven six hours from the town of mönchengladbach , was equally thrilled to get close to benedict . “ it ’ s great , we haven ’ t seen him before , ” said 11-year-old christine verjans , who said she was passing the time with her 10-year-old brother , bernhard , by playing tag , watching people and giving interviews to journalists .
“ it ’ s great fun even though it ’ ll still take so long before he comes . ” back at the information booth , boy scout christian pröhl said he wasn ’ t too upset that he would not be able to see the pope in munich as his shift went until 8 p.m. “ we ’ re going to see him in freising , ” he said , referring to the pope ’ s final stop of his trip next thursday .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland ! " earlier , munich ’ s central shopping mile , kaufingerstrasse , seemed almost deserted on saturday morning .
while the majority of munich residents had heeded calls to avoid downtown , those coming to see benedict arrive in the city were slow to trickle in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarians are gathering to welcome the pope “ maybe they ’ re coming from somewhere else , ” said christian pröhl , a 19-year-old boy scout from the nearby town of freising , who had volunteered to work at one of dozens of information points set up around the city to offer help to pilgrims . “ there are lots of ways that lead to marienplatz , ” he added . marienplatz , the square in front of munich ’ s city hall , had been chosen as the place where the pope would first pray with people during his visit to bavaria .
it was here that he bid his final farewell when he left munich as an archbishop in 1982 to move to rome . “ grüss gott , daheim ! ” or “ welcome home ” read the headline of one of the city ’ s saturday papers that were on sale in boxes along the street .
restaurants that had advertised live screenings of world cup soccer matches just a few weeks ago were not luring in guests with promises of live coverage of the pope ’ s visit that would take place a few hundred meters away . pope prices some stores were even trying to convince people to drop in by offering a special “ pope price ” – a 10 percent discount .
many shops hadn ’ t even opened on this crisp , sunny day while others decided to close early as nearly no one was coming by . “ we had one customer , the others were just looking for a restroom , ” said daniela schimanski , 32 , who works at a clothing store on marienplatz . but even the day ’ s ultimate sale items weren ’ t flying off the stands early saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope memorablia and goodies still have n't been selling like hot cakes “ we ’ ve been here since monday , but yesterday was the first day that people started opening up , ” said jürgen schreyeck , 57 , who ’ s been selling everything from pots and pans to building loans at street stalls for the past 30 years and was trying to find buyers for pope devotional objects including rosaries , t-shirts and coffee mugs with benedict ’ s image as well as yellow and white vatican flags . “ four euros -lrb- $ 5 -rrb- for the one you hold in the hand and six for the one that attaches to the car , ” schreyeck told a couple of women who had come to check out the merchandise . “ for me , these are the hardest things to sell , ” he said , adding that many people had questioned the ethics of selling papal knickknack . “ he doesn ’ t really want all of that , ” schreyeck said , referring to the pope .
“ he ’ s really the simplest kind of man . ”
but the salesman also made sure to point out that all his products had been officially sanctioned by the church . “ he speaks directly to the heart ” at marienplatz , where the roaring of helicopters flying above mingled with the first “ be-ne-detto ” chants , the most devoted pope admirers had already secured a space near st. mary ’ s column by noon to get as close as possible inside the high-security area .
the pope wasn ’ t expected to arrive before 5:30 p.m. “ i ’ ve been here since 8:30 a.m. – i just wanted to take in some of the atmosphere , ” said sister raphaela of the vincentian sisters of charity order , who had come from the neighboring state of baden-württemberg , adding that she had become an admirer of the pope only recently . “ before , i was neutral , ” said the 43-year-old nun , sitting on the ground just behind the bars set up before the column .
“ my opinion changed once i started reading his books .
i really like his language .
he speaks directly to the heart . ” the verjans family , who had driven six hours from the town of mönchengladbach , was equally thrilled to get close to benedict . “ it ’ s great , we haven ’ t seen him before , ” said 11-year-old christine verjans , who said she was passing the time with her 10-year-old brother , bernhard , by playing tag , watching people and giving interviews to journalists .

" but the penalization process has been stopped , " a beaming steinbrück said .
he added that berlin would present new figures on its budget deficit to the eu commission in october . " happy about the praise " the eu commission , which polices public finances in the 25-member bloc , recommended in july this year not to continue with deficit proceedings against germany . according to eu finance ministers , the german government has taken all the steps needed to lower by 2007 its budget deficit below the 3 percent ceiling laid down by the eu 's stability and growth pact .

2003 when the commission opened deficit proceedings against it in jan .

" the existence of such prisons is not compatible with my understanding of the rule of law .
even in the fight against terrorism ... the ends do not justify the means , " merkel said in berlin on saturday .
" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations . " highly questionable " the revelation has also added weight to a report by the council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's main human rights watchdog and independent from the eu , which said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . bush 's public admission has prompted renewed calls by european lawmakers that their governments divulge the locations of the secret cia prisons . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble also condemned the detentions . " i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

9 . the musicians from the south african national youth orchestra -lrb- sanyo -rrb- arrived this week in bonn and are tuning up for their much awaited performance saturday under the direction of conductor conrad van alphen . the orchestra 's diverse program , including beethoven 's famed fifth symphony , a new work composed by hans huyssen and commissioned by deutsche welle , and a set of eight songs by a zulu princess , will be broadcast live to the musicians ' home country . it does n't matter that the festival 's actual theme this year is " rossija . "
after all , sanyo is no stranger to cultural diversity . music breaks down barriers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen spent time teaching the orchestra his piece " we try to incorporate as many different cultures as possible in our organization , " said sanyo 's manager faan malan .
there are 11 languages and numerous different cultures in south africa and the youth orchestra tries to use music as a means of unification , he added . the orchestra directors hold country-wide auditions to select around 80 of the best musicians each year .
they 're also involved in numerous initiatives that promote music education in traditionally disadvantaged communities and aim to make the orchestra " elite " only in the musical - not the social - sense . " about 20 percent of the orchestra members come from disadvantaged backgrounds , " said malan . d for diversity - of people and flowers fostering cultural diversity in a country once split by apartheid is the kernel of hans huyssen 's new work " proteus variations . "
the south african born composer chose the protea , his country 's national flower , as a symbol for the rich variety of both plants and cultures there . " on one hand , the work is fully african because it was written in africa and is performed by an african orchestra , but sanyo is a western orchestra and plays western music in a western style .
there are certainly african elements in the piece , but they have been ' translated ' for a western audience , " said huyssen , humming a few of the native melodies he integrated into the work . huyssen has german grandparents and studied cello and composition in both europe and africa .
he has also immersed himself in african music and transcribed a great deal of it . festival breaks new ground with african guests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huyssen took south africa 's national flower as a symbol for cultural diversity huyssen 's work may incorporate a few african elements , but another piece on saturday 's program will be performed in an african language - zulu . the eight " princess magogo songs " were composed by one of africa 's most well-known composers , princess magogo -lrb- 1900-1984 -rrb- , who was the daughter of the zulu king dinuzulu . " it is the first time that an orchestra from africa has been our guest here and i hope that it is a beginning that will continue to develop , " said the director of the beethoven festival , ilona schmiel . she attributed the political element of the project to the fact that it is under the aegis of german president horst köhler . cultural exchange will also be taking place beyond the stage .
the young musicians are staying in bonn with host families before they continue on to berlin for a workshop with renowned conductor herbert blomstedt at the berlin philharmonic . live broadcast to south africa each year , deutsche welle sponsors a young orchestra during the beethoven festival and commissions a work by a composer from that country .
since its initiation in 2001 , musicians from kiev , istanbul , tbilisi , beijing , and krakow have participated in the project . sanyo 's concert , which will be performed saturday at 8:00 p.m.

but if they play the game of their life they may fulfill a dream . david vs. goliath contests in soccer always attract the attention of fans , even those not really interested in the game . seldom is there a huge upset like the one that happened this week when germany demolished san marino 13-0 . but when it does , a supporter who witnessed the shocking outcome will fondly remember it over the years .
for example , fourth-division fc magdeburg 's heart-stopping victory in penalties against bayern munich in november 2000 .
and we should remember that this was not a munich club that had an unusually poor season .
that team would go on to win the champions league against valencia . such a possibility makes domestic cup competitions around europe popular and shows that minnows stocked with students , bank tellers , and carpenters can sometimes swallow the big clubs . songs written bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : referee robert hoyzer 's match-fixing is also part of cup history the stages for the contests against amateur clubs all take place in grounds that at times resemble high school stadiums more than the glamour of top-flight european soccer .
one-time tasks must be accomplished without any hitches .
camera teams from german public television must be catered to , extra rooms for doping tests set up , even coaching boxes . " it was n't clear to us that the planning would take on such dimensions , " said gerd olbrich , chair of fifth-division side tsg thannhausen , which are welcoming six-time german champions borrusia dortmund . the club 's board may be dealing with the formalities demanded from the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , but the massive support from the 6,629 residents of the tiny south bavarian community is evident .
they have written a song to irritate the visitors and their 800 supporters traveling from the north , who traditionally wear black-and-yellow .
even the band 's name is supposed to intimidate dortmund - " the hornets from mars " . grass cut for free bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stadiums like this one in hoffenheim are standard for the cup emotions before these matches do run high but the teams must also think of more earthly things - like cutting the grass .
the amateurs from bremerhaven must have forgotten that before playing schalke last year or could n't afford to cut it .
or they thought it would be to their advantage . then , booting the ball forward in the air was mandatory .
the grass was so long that shots on the ground rolled harmlessly to the goalkeeper .
and attempts to dribble the ball ended with it advancing a few feet before the dribbler unwittingly stumbled over it .
nevertheless , the royal blues managed to overcome the vexing problem and won 3-0 . the club westfalia herne , not located far from the schalke city of gelsenkirchen , has received the generous support of the city which mowed the grass to a playable height for free . the german cup is a chance for weekend warriors to stand face-to-face , and tread boot-to-boot against international stars .
seldom does it come to a second game for teams like pirmasens -lrb- they play bremen -rrb- or rossbach -lrb- they face mönchengladbach -rrb- .
but probably in every locker room of the 28 amateur clubs participating in this season 's cup , the words " fc magdeburg " will be written on the chalkboard to remind the players that dreams do occasionally come true . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern stumble towards historic double with dfb cup win a lackluster bayern munich avoided a potential upset saturday by beating a strong eintracht frankfurt team 1-0 to retain the dfb cup .

" instead we must find answers to how we can combat terrorists effectively without calling our fundamental principles and beliefs in question , " she said . since media reports first revealed the cia operation last november , bush and other members of his administration have refused to publicly discuss the program .
at the end of last year , us secretary of state condoleeza rice visited europe and defended washington 's treatment of its detainees in the war on terrorism , but did not address the issue of whether the cia had operated secret prisons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush 's admission has angered many this week however , us president george w bush admitted for the first time that the cia was running secret prisons where high-level al qaeda figures captured since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks were held and interrogated .
he did not name their locations . " highly questionable " the revelation has also added weight to a report by the council of europe in strasbourg , the continent 's main human rights watchdog and independent from the eu , which said that several european states had helped the us carry out " extraordinary rendition " flights , the us practice of transporting detainees to other states for interrogation . bush 's public admission has prompted renewed calls by european lawmakers that their governments divulge the locations of the secret cia prisons . germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble also condemned the detentions . " i 've never seen a reason for interning terror suspects - like in guantanamo - outside the jurisdiction of american courts .
it 's highly questionable , " schäuble told regional paper passauer neue presse , adding that he had no information that the cia had operated secret prisons in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is already under fire for the guantanamo bay prison camp " our american friends are also well advised to protect our freedom and legal system in such a way as to ensure that the fundamental principles of the legal system are not abandoned .
when it comes to a ban on torture there can be no leeway , " schäuble said . the german government 's human rights commissioner , günter nooke said it was unacceptable that president bush seemed to want to justify the " special interrogations " in the prisons . " i want to know where the prisons are and who knew about them , " nooke said . reinhard bütikofer , head of the opposition green party accused bush of " leading the world along for years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel enjoys close ties with bush despite her criticism , merkel however said she welcomed the fact that bush had raised the issue of the prisons himself . merkel has enjoyed warm relations with the american president since succeeding gerhard schröder last year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .

having drawn all those matches and having gone out of the german cup , hamburg 's start to this season has been disappointing .
without sanogo , it would have been disastrous . sanogo was born in 1982 in the ivorian town of dimbokro .
after playing six years in the middle east , he debuted in the bundesliga last season for kaiserslautern .
he scored 10 goals in 24 matches for the red devils , providing one of the few bright spots in a side that eventually got relegated . an afterthought pays off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg have had no problems integrating their new striker signing sanogo was something of an afterthought for hamburg .
the northern german club only decided to pay kaiserslautern 's 3.8 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- asking price in late july - after failing to secure the services of bigger names like milan baros .
many doubted whether he 's be able to establish himself at one of the bundesliga 's biggest sides . but sanogo has silenced his critics .
a great leaper , he 's a constant threat in the air , and he 's equally good with both feet .
he 's also proving consistent , scoring in each of hamburg 's bundesliga games .
he 's even nicknamed " jürgen " - after germany soccer legend jürgen klinsmann . hamburg are delighted with the way their new signing has fit in - both on and off the field .
" he 's a very straightforward guy , " hamburg coach thomas doll told the bundesliga 's official website .
" as a father of two , he knows what it means to take on responsibility . " and as if to underscore his central role for his new club , sanogo scored again in hamburg 's german cup match on saturday - although hamburg went on to lose 4-3 .
he 's only played once for ivory coast 's national squad .
but if his recent form continues , soccer fans can look forward to sanogo pairing up with ivorian superstar didier drogba on a much more regular basis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cup : dreams up for grabs rossbach , thannhausen , herne , pirmasens : it may be the only time that players from those clubs walk on the same pitch with klose , makaay or van der vaart .

the 79-year-old pontiff drove into the centre of town in his white " papamobile . " " it is very moving for me to be back in this beautiful square , at the foot of the column of the virgin mary , " he said at marienplatz , the main square of the bavarian capital that was packed with crowds including many in traditional folk dress . he smiled and nodded in agreement when bavarian premier edmund stoiber announced : " our german pope has come back to his bavarian homeland !

but the government said the stoppage was a political failure , because support was limited to the east .
the action was widely seen as the biggest challenge yet to the authority of president evo morales .
the strikers are objecting to plans to allow a constituent assembly to amend the charter by simple majority vote .
a power struggle between bolivia 's wealthier , white elite - which opposes the changes - and its indigenous majority is at the heart of the row .
friday 's strike prompted calls for compromise in what is seen as an increasingly polarised situation .
" we 're headed , both parties , the opposition and the government - to extreme positions , " congressman jose ona from the conservative podemos party told the associated press news agency .
" we have to try to create a dialogue and arrive at the type of conversations that can avoid these conflicts . "
in santa cruz , buses , schools and businesses were reported to have closed .
protesters blocked roads into the city , where the streets were deserted , ap reported .
strike leaders fought members of unions supportive of the president in the city 's streets .
strikes also took place in three other states .
together , the states form a crescent-shaped area that curves around bolivia 's south-eastern lowlands - known as the " media luna " or half moon .
they are home to about a third of bolivia 's population , including most of its white european-descended minority .
' totalitarian ' " this is a historic day of struggle for democracy and against authoritarianism , " said german angelo , president of the civic committee of santa cruz .
but interior minister alicia munoz said the strike was a " total political failure " because few people took part .
one of the central demands of the mass social movements which helped get mr morales elected was that bolivia 's constitution be rewritten .
indigenous activists say the charter entrenches the dominance of the non-indigenous elite .
mr morales established the constituent assembly in august , but lacks the support of two-thirds of delegates he needs to push through changes .
he wants each article to be passed by a simple majority , with two-thirds support needed only to ratify the final document -while the opposition accuses the government of changing the rules illegally .
' making problems ' but the bbc 's damian kahya in la paz says the strike is about more than procedures .
the four eastern regions - which hold most of bolivia 's wealth and natural gas - also recently voted for autonomy , something mr morales opposes .
a spokesman for the bolivian government , pablo solon , said the strike was about more than day-to-day politics .
" in order to have more for the poor sector there is a rich sector that has to give something up and of course this rich sector is going to try to make as much problem as you can see .

the action was widely seen as the biggest challenge yet to the authority of president evo morales .
the strikers are objecting to plans to allow a constituent assembly to amend the charter by simple majority vote .
a power struggle between bolivia 's wealthier , white elite - which opposes the changes - and its indigenous majority is at the heart of the row .
friday 's strike prompted calls for compromise in what is seen as an increasingly polarised situation .
" we 're headed , both parties , the opposition and the government - to extreme positions , " congressman jose ona from the conservative podemos party told the associated press news agency .
" we have to try to create a dialogue and arrive at the type of conversations that can avoid these conflicts . "
in santa cruz , buses , schools and businesses were reported to have closed .
protesters blocked roads into the city , where the streets were deserted , ap reported .
strike leaders fought members of unions supportive of the president in the city 's streets .
strikes also took place in three other states .
together , the states form a crescent-shaped area that curves around bolivia 's south-eastern lowlands - known as the " media luna " or half moon .
they are home to about a third of bolivia 's population , including most of its white european-descended minority .
' totalitarian ' " this is a historic day of struggle for democracy and against authoritarianism , " said german angelo , president of the civic committee of santa cruz .
but interior minister alicia munoz said the strike was a " total political failure " because few people took part .
one of the central demands of the mass social movements which helped get mr morales elected was that bolivia 's constitution be rewritten .
indigenous activists say the charter entrenches the dominance of the non-indigenous elite .
mr morales established the constituent assembly in august , but lacks the support of two-thirds of delegates he needs to push through changes .
he wants each article to be passed by a simple majority , with two-thirds support needed only to ratify the final document -while the opposition accuses the government of changing the rules illegally .
' making problems ' but the bbc 's damian kahya in la paz says the strike is about more than procedures .
the strikers oppose sweeping changes to bolivia 's constitution the four eastern regions - which hold most of bolivia 's wealth and natural gas - also recently voted for autonomy , something mr morales opposes .
a spokesman for the bolivian government , pablo solon , said the strike was about more than day-to-day politics .

the revelation about mr armitage is the latest development in an affair which has seen federal charges laid against the lewis " scooter " libby , former chief of staff to vice president cheney .
here , the bbc news website world affairs correspondent paul reynolds looks at the background to the case .
what is this case about ?
valerie plame 's identity as a cia officer tracking nuclear proliferation was leaked in an article by columnist robert novak shortly after her husband joseph wilson , a former us diplomat , published an article in the new york times in july 2003 .
wilson criticised the bush administration 's use of intelligence before the war in iraq , undermining its allegation that iraq had tried to buy uranium from niger , which wilson had investigated .
president bush had mentioned niger in his state of the union speech .
deliberately revealing an agent 's name is a serious offence in the us and the leak sparked a high-level criminal inquiry .
the inquiry did not result in charges over the revelation of plame 's identity but " scooter " libby was charged with perjury and obstructing justice .
in july 2006 , ms plame and mr wilson filed a civil lawsuit against vice-president dick cheney , mr libby and presidential adviser karl rove , accusing them of being behind the leak and maliciously exposing her identity and destroying her career .
how does the armitage role change things ?
it changes everything because the affair was seen as one in which the administration 's leading neo-conservatives took revenge on joseph wilson by " outing " his wife .
now it has emerged that her name was given much more informally by an official with no such agenda .
the washington post said in an editorial that " one of the most sensational charges levelled against the bush white house - that it orchestrated the leak of ms plame 's identity to ruin her career and thus punish mr wilson - is untrue . "
robert novak has said : " i do n't believe that it was a conscious leak . "
he said he had been told about wilson 's wife when he asked an official -lrb- now known to be armitage -rrb- why wilson had been chosen for the niger inquiry why did armitage keep quiet for so long ? "
he says he told patrick fitzgerald , the special prosecutor investigating the affair , in 2003 that he might have been the source for the novak article .
he says fitzgerald told him not to say anything .
people are now asking why fitzgerald pursued others in the case with such determination .
what about karl rove , the president 's aide ?
on 12 july 2006 , novak told fox news that rove had replied " oh you know that , too " , when novak -lrb- presumably after speaking to armitage -rrb- put it to him that plame worked at the cia .
novak said that their discussion of plame lasted only about 20 seconds .
rove 's lawyers said that rove 's recollection was that he had replied " i 've heard that , too . "
mr rove was under investigation for some months and testified to the grand jury investigating the leak .
then on 13 june 2006 his lawyer robert luskin announced : " on 12 june 12 , 2006 , special counsel patrick fitzgerald formally advised us that he does not anticipate seeking charges against karl rove . "
the indictment against mr libby referred to an " official a " at the white house with whom mr libby discussed the issue .
the official told mr libby that he had discussed mr wilson 's wife with columnist robert novak who would be writing about her cia connection .
novak 's article on 14 july 2003 was the first time valerie plame had been mentioned publicly .
" official a " was said by the us media to be karl rove .
joseph wilson said at one stage that he would be happy to see mr rove marched from the white house in handcuffs .
what are the charges against mr libby ?
mr libby has not been charged with leaking the name .
he has been charged with two counts of perjury , two counts of making a false statement and one of obstruction of justice .
he could face up to 30 years in prison - up to 10 years on the obstruction charge and up to five years on the others .
however , lawyers say that any sentence would probably be much less because , if he is found guilty , the offences might be taken as part of a single action and run concurrently .
he also faces a maximum fine of $ 1.25m.
he has pleaded not guilty .
what is mr libby said to have done ?
according to a statement from the office of the special prosecuting counsel patrick fitzgerald , mr libby lied to fbi investigators and the grand jury about how and when he learned that valerie plame was a cia officer and lied about disclosing classified information to reporters .
the information was classified as it is a crime to deliberately and knowingly disclose the name of a secret cia employee .
he is alleged to have claimed that he learned about ms plame 's name and job from reporters when he had already been told this by other government officials and vice-president cheney .
his story , according to mr fitzgerald , was that " he was just passing gossip from one reporter to another at the long end of a chain of phone calls . "
mr fitzgerald said : " this is not true , according to the indictment . "
washington post reporter bob woodward since testified that he was told about ms plame a month before she was named in a newspaper column .
he did not name the official who told him but said it was not mr libby .
woodward also said he had spoken to mr libby twice in june 2003 about the iraq war but mr libby had not mentioned ms plame .
this was at a time when mr libby was allegedly active in campaigning against her husband .
it remains to be seen if the admission by richard armitage affects the libby case .
valerie plame says she will not drop her lawsuit what is the background to this case ?
in 2001 , according to a report from the senate intelligence committee , the cia was told by an unnamed foreign intelligence service that iraq had agreed with niger in west africa to buy several hundred tons of yellowcake , the refined product from uranium ore .
subsequently , the foreign service gave the cia what was said to be the text of the contract for this sale .
since iraq had no civilian use for uranium , the fear was that it was developing a military programme in defiance of un sanctions .
vice-president cheney asked what the cia thought .
in february 2002 , the cia despatched ms plame 's husband , former us ambassador joseph wilson , to niger to investigate .
he was told to ask whether niger had been approached , had conducted talks or had made an agreement to sell uranium to " countries of concern , " which included iraq .
why was mr wilson chosen ?
the senate report says that he had been to niger for the cia in 1999 .
his name on that occasion was suggested by his wife , valerie plame , who was a covert officer in the cia 's nuclear counter-proliferation division .
the report says that interviews and documents indicated that his wife had suggested his name for this trip as well .
she then approached her husband .
mr wilson was not required to sign a confidentiality agreement .
what did mr wilson find ?
he found no evidence there had been any sale .
nigerien officials strongly denied there could have been .
for a start a french-led consortium controlled its uranium industry .
but mr wilson found an intriguing possibility that iraq might have approached niger .
this suspicion came from a former nigerien prime minister ibrahim mayaki .
he said he had been urged in 1999 by an unnamed businessman to meet an iraqi delegation which wanted to " expand commercial relations " .
as uranium was virtually the only thing niger had to sell , mr mayaki interpreted this to mean that iraq wanted to discuss yellowcake sales .
however when he actually met the delegation , mr mayaki said he steered conversation away from trade , nothing was mentioned on either side and so the issue was not resolved .
mr wilson told the senate committee staff that he had given the us ambassador in niger his view that there was " nothing to the story " .
the ambassador , the senate report says , had reached the same conclusion .
what impact did mr wilson 's report have ?
the cia felt mr wilson had added no substantial new information , but that his talk with mr mayaki had been the most interesting and important aspect .
the cia was inclined to believe that iraq might have been trying to get yellowcake from niger .
the state department continued with the more sceptical view it had expressed earlier .
the cia did not brief the vice-president , despite his earlier interest .
in september 2002 , a national intelligence estimate included a reference to reports indicating that iraq had sought uranium from africa , but this was not included in the key findings as it felt to be subsidiary to the main evidence against iraq .
lewis " scooter " libby 's trial is due to start in 2007 what about the british government claims ?
also in september 2002 , the british government published a white paper stating that " there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
the british government has stuck to its position , with support from the committee chaired by the former cabinet secretary lord butler , which investigated intelligence and the iraq war .
the british sources are not known .
despite its inclination to believe the niger connection , and possible links to other african sources of uranium such as somalia , there remained doubts in the cia about how much weight should be given to the claim .
at one stage the cia said it had told congress that " the brits have exaggerated this issue . "
nevertheless it appeared in mr bush 's state of the union speech to congress in january 2003 .
why did president bush mention the british claim in his state of the union speech ?
us intelligence agencies gave less prominence to the uranium claim than did the british .
however , the claim did have some credibility in cia eyes and the national security council wanted it mentioned without revealing the cia 's own information .
so the speech simply said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
these are the so-called famous 16 words .
then-secretary of state colin powell did not mention uranium in his speech to the security council in february 2003 .
were the documents in the case forgeries ?
yes .
in october 2002 , elisabetta burba , an italian journalist , was given documents purporting to relate to a sale of uranium by niger to iraq .
she obtained them from rocco martino , a former sismi -lrb- italian military intelligence -rrb- employee who styled himself a " freelance intelligence agent " .
he said he got them from an employee at the nigerien embassy in rome .
suspicious , burba passed them onto to the americans .
they appear to have been the same documents which the cia was told about in 2001 .
it was not until early february 2003 , shortly before the invasion , that the us government gave these documents to the international atomic energy agency for examination .
soon afterwards a senior cia africa analyst said the documents could be fraudulent .
one us analyst had already said they looked " funky . "
the iaea quickly concluded that the documents were forgeries .
on 11 march , the cia itself said it did not " dispute " this conclusion .
on 17 june , the cia accepted that because the documents were false , it no longer believed there was " enough other reporting to conclude that iraq sought uranium from aboard . "
the source of the forgeries has not been established .
under questioning from an italian parliamentary committee , sismi has denied that it had a role in their fabrication or distribution .
when were the " 16 words " in the state of the union speech withdrawn ?
in july 2003 , the cia director george tenet said the words " should never have been included " in the speech .
" from what we know now , -lsb- cia -rsb- officials in the end concurred that the text in the speech was factually correct - ie , that the british government report said that iraq sought uranium from africa .
this should not have been the test for clearing a presidential address .
" this did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches , and the cia should have ensured that it was removed . "
when did joseph wilson intervene ?
mr wilson said that the day after the state of the union speech he told the state department the statement was not borne out by the facts as he understood them .
in may 2003 , the new york times reported that an unnamed former ambassador had been to niger and reported that there had been no uranium sale and documents in the case had been forged .
in june of that year the washington post , using mr wilson as its source , reported that the former ambassador had had doubts about the uranium sale because dates and names on the contract were wrong .
in fact , mr wilson had not seen the documents and had " misspoken , " as he later put it .
but it was a sign that mr wilson had decided to go public .
joseph wilson : the former ambassador hits back he then wrote an article under his own name in the new york times on 6 july called " what i did n't find in africa . "
he concluded that it was " highly doubtful " that any sale had taken place .
and he went beyond that to attack the bush administration .
" some of the intelligence related to iraq 's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the iraqi threat , " he wrote .
he also started to give public interviews .
why would the white house want to unmask mr wilson 's wife ?
the supposition is that it wanted to undermine wilson 's credibility by suggesting that his wife had put up his name for the niger trip as a way of enhancing his reputation and perhaps business interests .
to do this , valerie plame 's name and role had to be exposed .
however , since it now appears that richard armitage was the original source , the allegations against the white house have lost a great deal of their power .
according to the indictment against him , mr libby was critical of the cia for " selective leaking " when media stories started appearing about the niger story and had told judith miller of the new york times on 23 june 2003 that wilson 's wife might work for the cia .
he became even more active after mr wilson 's new york times article .
judith miller spent nearly three months in prison for contempt of court until she agreed to testify about her conversations with mr libby .
mr wilson himself also came under criticism .
he denied that his wife had played a substantive part in the decision to send him but she did , the senate report accepts , put up his name .
he also claimed in the washington post that he had seen documents which he had not and wrongly assumed that vice-president cheney had been briefed on his findings .
he was also accused of going public in a way that might jeopardise his wife 's position .
mr wilson remains unapologetic .
mr libby 's trial is not expected until january 2007 .
whether he will plea-bargain - that is plead guilty to some charges in exchange for a lesser sentence - is not known .

in july 2006 , ms plame and mr wilson filed a civil lawsuit against vice-president dick cheney , mr libby and presidential adviser karl rove , accusing them of being behind the leak and maliciously exposing her identity and destroying her career .
how does the armitage role change things ?
it changes everything because the affair was seen as one in which the administration 's leading neo-conservatives took revenge on joseph wilson by " outing " his wife .
now it has emerged that her name was given much more informally by an official with no such agenda .
the washington post said in an editorial that " one of the most sensational charges levelled against the bush white house - that it orchestrated the leak of ms plame 's identity to ruin her career and thus punish mr wilson - is untrue . "
robert novak has said : " i do n't believe that it was a conscious leak . "
he said he had been told about wilson 's wife when he asked an official -lrb- now known to be armitage -rrb- why wilson had been chosen for the niger inquiry why did armitage keep quiet for so long ? "
he says he told patrick fitzgerald , the special prosecutor investigating the affair , in 2003 that he might have been the source for the novak article .
he says fitzgerald told him not to say anything .
people are now asking why fitzgerald pursued others in the case with such determination .
what about karl rove , the president 's aide ?
on 12 july 2006 , novak told fox news that rove had replied " oh you know that , too " , when novak -lrb- presumably after speaking to armitage -rrb- put it to him that plame worked at the cia .
novak said that their discussion of plame lasted only about 20 seconds .
rove 's lawyers said that rove 's recollection was that he had replied " i 've heard that , too . "
mr rove was under investigation for some months and testified to the grand jury investigating the leak .
then on 13 june 2006 his lawyer robert luskin announced : " on 12 june 12 , 2006 , special counsel patrick fitzgerald formally advised us that he does not anticipate seeking charges against karl rove . "
the indictment against mr libby referred to an " official a " at the white house with whom mr libby discussed the issue .
the official told mr libby that he had discussed mr wilson 's wife with columnist robert novak who would be writing about her cia connection .
novak 's article on 14 july 2003 was the first time valerie plame had been mentioned publicly .
" official a " was said by the us media to be karl rove .
joseph wilson said at one stage that he would be happy to see mr rove marched from the white house in handcuffs .
what are the charges against mr libby ?
mr libby has not been charged with leaking the name .
he has been charged with two counts of perjury , two counts of making a false statement and one of obstruction of justice .
he could face up to 30 years in prison - up to 10 years on the obstruction charge and up to five years on the others .
however , lawyers say that any sentence would probably be much less because , if he is found guilty , the offences might be taken as part of a single action and run concurrently .
he also faces a maximum fine of $ 1.25m.
he has pleaded not guilty .
what is mr libby said to have done ?
according to a statement from the office of the special prosecuting counsel patrick fitzgerald , mr libby lied to fbi investigators and the grand jury about how and when he learned that valerie plame was a cia officer and lied about disclosing classified information to reporters .
the information was classified as it is a crime to deliberately and knowingly disclose the name of a secret cia employee .
he is alleged to have claimed that he learned about ms plame 's name and job from reporters when he had already been told this by other government officials and vice-president cheney .
his story , according to mr fitzgerald , was that " he was just passing gossip from one reporter to another at the long end of a chain of phone calls . "
mr fitzgerald said : " this is not true , according to the indictment . "
washington post reporter bob woodward since testified that he was told about ms plame a month before she was named in a newspaper column .
he did not name the official who told him but said it was not mr libby .
woodward also said he had spoken to mr libby twice in june 2003 about the iraq war but mr libby had not mentioned ms plame .
this was at a time when mr libby was allegedly active in campaigning against her husband .
it remains to be seen if the admission by richard armitage affects the libby case .
valerie plame says she will not drop her lawsuit what is the background to this case ?
in 2001 , according to a report from the senate intelligence committee , the cia was told by an unnamed foreign intelligence service that iraq had agreed with niger in west africa to buy several hundred tons of yellowcake , the refined product from uranium ore .
subsequently , the foreign service gave the cia what was said to be the text of the contract for this sale .
since iraq had no civilian use for uranium , the fear was that it was developing a military programme in defiance of un sanctions .
vice-president cheney asked what the cia thought .
in february 2002 , the cia despatched ms plame 's husband , former us ambassador joseph wilson , to niger to investigate .
he was told to ask whether niger had been approached , had conducted talks or had made an agreement to sell uranium to " countries of concern , " which included iraq .
why was mr wilson chosen ?
the senate report says that he had been to niger for the cia in 1999 .
his name on that occasion was suggested by his wife , valerie plame , who was a covert officer in the cia 's nuclear counter-proliferation division .
the report says that interviews and documents indicated that his wife had suggested his name for this trip as well .
she then approached her husband .
mr wilson was not required to sign a confidentiality agreement .
what did mr wilson find ?
he found no evidence there had been any sale .
nigerien officials strongly denied there could have been .
for a start a french-led consortium controlled its uranium industry .
but mr wilson found an intriguing possibility that iraq might have approached niger .
this suspicion came from a former nigerien prime minister ibrahim mayaki .
he said he had been urged in 1999 by an unnamed businessman to meet an iraqi delegation which wanted to " expand commercial relations " .
as uranium was virtually the only thing niger had to sell , mr mayaki interpreted this to mean that iraq wanted to discuss yellowcake sales .
however when he actually met the delegation , mr mayaki said he steered conversation away from trade , nothing was mentioned on either side and so the issue was not resolved .
mr wilson told the senate committee staff that he had given the us ambassador in niger his view that there was " nothing to the story " .
the ambassador , the senate report says , had reached the same conclusion .
what impact did mr wilson 's report have ?
the cia felt mr wilson had added no substantial new information , but that his talk with mr mayaki had been the most interesting and important aspect .
the cia was inclined to believe that iraq might have been trying to get yellowcake from niger .
the state department continued with the more sceptical view it had expressed earlier .
the cia did not brief the vice-president , despite his earlier interest .
in september 2002 , a national intelligence estimate included a reference to reports indicating that iraq had sought uranium from africa , but this was not included in the key findings as it felt to be subsidiary to the main evidence against iraq .
lewis " scooter " libby 's trial is due to start in 2007 what about the british government claims ?
also in september 2002 , the british government published a white paper stating that " there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
the british government has stuck to its position , with support from the committee chaired by the former cabinet secretary lord butler , which investigated intelligence and the iraq war .
the british sources are not known .
despite its inclination to believe the niger connection , and possible links to other african sources of uranium such as somalia , there remained doubts in the cia about how much weight should be given to the claim .
at one stage the cia said it had told congress that " the brits have exaggerated this issue . "
nevertheless it appeared in mr bush 's state of the union speech to congress in january 2003 .
why did president bush mention the british claim in his state of the union speech ?
us intelligence agencies gave less prominence to the uranium claim than did the british .
however , the claim did have some credibility in cia eyes and the national security council wanted it mentioned without revealing the cia 's own information .
so the speech simply said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
these are the so-called famous 16 words .
then-secretary of state colin powell did not mention uranium in his speech to the security council in february 2003 .
were the documents in the case forgeries ?
yes .
in october 2002 , elisabetta burba , an italian journalist , was given documents purporting to relate to a sale of uranium by niger to iraq .
she obtained them from rocco martino , a former sismi -lrb- italian military intelligence -rrb- employee who styled himself a " freelance intelligence agent " .
he said he got them from an employee at the nigerien embassy in rome .
suspicious , burba passed them onto to the americans .
they appear to have been the same documents which the cia was told about in 2001 .
it was not until early february 2003 , shortly before the invasion , that the us government gave these documents to the international atomic energy agency for examination .
soon afterwards a senior cia africa analyst said the documents could be fraudulent .
one us analyst had already said they looked " funky . "
the iaea quickly concluded that the documents were forgeries .
on 11 march , the cia itself said it did not " dispute " this conclusion .
on 17 june , the cia accepted that because the documents were false , it no longer believed there was " enough other reporting to conclude that iraq sought uranium from aboard . "
the source of the forgeries has not been established .
under questioning from an italian parliamentary committee , sismi has denied that it had a role in their fabrication or distribution .
when were the " 16 words " in the state of the union speech withdrawn ?
in july 2003 , the cia director george tenet said the words " should never have been included " in the speech .
" from what we know now , -lsb- cia -rsb- officials in the end concurred that the text in the speech was factually correct - ie , that the british government report said that iraq sought uranium from africa .
this should not have been the test for clearing a presidential address .
" this did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches , and the cia should have ensured that it was removed . "
when did joseph wilson intervene ?
mr wilson said that the day after the state of the union speech he told the state department the statement was not borne out by the facts as he understood them .
in may 2003 , the new york times reported that an unnamed former ambassador had been to niger and reported that there had been no uranium sale and documents in the case had been forged .
in june of that year the washington post , using mr wilson as its source , reported that the former ambassador had had doubts about the uranium sale because dates and names on the contract were wrong .
in fact , mr wilson had not seen the documents and had " misspoken , " as he later put it .
but it was a sign that mr wilson had decided to go public .
joseph wilson : the former ambassador hits back he then wrote an article under his own name in the new york times on 6 july called " what i did n't find in africa . "
he concluded that it was " highly doubtful " that any sale had taken place .
and he went beyond that to attack the bush administration .
" some of the intelligence related to iraq 's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the iraqi threat , " he wrote .
he also started to give public interviews .
why would the white house want to unmask mr wilson 's wife ?
the supposition is that it wanted to undermine wilson 's credibility by suggesting that his wife had put up his name for the niger trip as a way of enhancing his reputation and perhaps business interests .
to do this , valerie plame 's name and role had to be exposed .
however , since it now appears that richard armitage was the original source , the allegations against the white house have lost a great deal of their power .
according to the indictment against him , mr libby was critical of the cia for " selective leaking " when media stories started appearing about the niger story and had told judith miller of the new york times on 23 june 2003 that wilson 's wife might work for the cia .
he became even more active after mr wilson 's new york times article .
judith miller spent nearly three months in prison for contempt of court until she agreed to testify about her conversations with mr libby .
mr wilson himself also came under criticism .
he denied that his wife had played a substantive part in the decision to send him but she did , the senate report accepts , put up his name .
he also claimed in the washington post that he had seen documents which he had not and wrongly assumed that vice-president cheney had been briefed on his findings .
he was also accused of going public in a way that might jeopardise his wife 's position .
mr wilson remains unapologetic .
mr libby 's trial is not expected until january 2007 .
whether he will plea-bargain - that is plead guilty to some charges in exchange for a lesser sentence - is not known .

the revelation about mr armitage is the latest development in an affair which has seen federal charges laid against the lewis " scooter " libby , former chief of staff to vice president cheney .
here , the bbc news website world affairs correspondent paul reynolds looks at the background to the case .
what is this case about ?
valerie plame 's identity as a cia officer tracking nuclear proliferation was leaked in an article by columnist robert novak shortly after her husband joseph wilson , a former us diplomat , published an article in the new york times in july 2003 .
wilson criticised the bush administration 's use of intelligence before the war in iraq , undermining its allegation that iraq had tried to buy uranium from niger , which wilson had investigated .
president bush had mentioned niger in his state of the union speech .
deliberately revealing an agent 's name is a serious offence in the us and the leak sparked a high-level criminal inquiry .
the inquiry did not result in charges over the revelation of plame 's identity but " scooter " libby was charged with perjury and obstructing justice .

the revelation about mr armitage is the latest development in an affair which has seen federal charges laid against the lewis " scooter " libby , former chief of staff to vice president cheney .
here , the bbc news website world affairs correspondent paul reynolds looks at the background to the case .
what is this case about ?
valerie plame 's identity as a cia officer tracking nuclear proliferation was leaked in an article by columnist robert novak shortly after her husband joseph wilson , a former us diplomat , published an article in the new york times in july 2003 .
wilson criticised the bush administration 's use of intelligence before the war in iraq , undermining its allegation that iraq had tried to buy uranium from niger , which wilson had investigated .
president bush had mentioned niger in his state of the union speech .
deliberately revealing an agent 's name is a serious offence in the us and the leak sparked a high-level criminal inquiry .
the inquiry did not result in charges over the revelation of plame 's identity but " scooter " libby was charged with perjury and obstructing justice .
in july 2006 , ms plame and mr wilson filed a civil lawsuit against vice-president dick cheney , mr libby and presidential adviser karl rove , accusing them of being behind the leak and maliciously exposing her identity and destroying her career .
how does the armitage role change things ?
it changes everything because the affair was seen as one in which the administration 's leading neo-conservatives took revenge on joseph wilson by " outing " his wife .
now it has emerged that her name was given much more informally by an official with no such agenda .
the washington post said in an editorial that " one of the most sensational charges levelled against the bush white house - that it orchestrated the leak of ms plame 's identity to ruin her career and thus punish mr wilson - is untrue . "
robert novak has said : " i do n't believe that it was a conscious leak . "
he said he had been told about wilson 's wife when he asked an official -lrb- now known to be armitage -rrb- why wilson had been chosen for the niger inquiry why did armitage keep quiet for so long ? "
he says he told patrick fitzgerald , the special prosecutor investigating the affair , in 2003 that he might have been the source for the novak article .
he says fitzgerald told him not to say anything .
people are now asking why fitzgerald pursued others in the case with such determination .
what about karl rove , the president 's aide ?
on 12 july 2006 , novak told fox news that rove had replied " oh you know that , too " , when novak -lrb- presumably after speaking to armitage -rrb- put it to him that plame worked at the cia .
novak said that their discussion of plame lasted only about 20 seconds .
rove 's lawyers said that rove 's recollection was that he had replied " i 've heard that , too . "
mr rove was under investigation for some months and testified to the grand jury investigating the leak .
then on 13 june 2006 his lawyer robert luskin announced : " on 12 june 12 , 2006 , special counsel patrick fitzgerald formally advised us that he does not anticipate seeking charges against karl rove . "
the indictment against mr libby referred to an " official a " at the white house with whom mr libby discussed the issue .
the official told mr libby that he had discussed mr wilson 's wife with columnist robert novak who would be writing about her cia connection .
novak 's article on 14 july 2003 was the first time valerie plame had been mentioned publicly .
" official a " was said by the us media to be karl rove .
joseph wilson said at one stage that he would be happy to see mr rove marched from the white house in handcuffs .
what are the charges against mr libby ?
mr libby has not been charged with leaking the name .
he has been charged with two counts of perjury , two counts of making a false statement and one of obstruction of justice .
he could face up to 30 years in prison - up to 10 years on the obstruction charge and up to five years on the others .
however , lawyers say that any sentence would probably be much less because , if he is found guilty , the offences might be taken as part of a single action and run concurrently .
he also faces a maximum fine of $ 1.25m.
he has pleaded not guilty .
what is mr libby said to have done ?
according to a statement from the office of the special prosecuting counsel patrick fitzgerald , mr libby lied to fbi investigators and the grand jury about how and when he learned that valerie plame was a cia officer and lied about disclosing classified information to reporters .
the information was classified as it is a crime to deliberately and knowingly disclose the name of a secret cia employee .
he is alleged to have claimed that he learned about ms plame 's name and job from reporters when he had already been told this by other government officials and vice-president cheney .
his story , according to mr fitzgerald , was that " he was just passing gossip from one reporter to another at the long end of a chain of phone calls . "
mr fitzgerald said : " this is not true , according to the indictment . "
washington post reporter bob woodward since testified that he was told about ms plame a month before she was named in a newspaper column .
he did not name the official who told him but said it was not mr libby .
woodward also said he had spoken to mr libby twice in june 2003 about the iraq war but mr libby had not mentioned ms plame .
this was at a time when mr libby was allegedly active in campaigning against her husband .
it remains to be seen if the admission by richard armitage affects the libby case .
valerie plame says she will not drop her lawsuit what is the background to this case ?
in 2001 , according to a report from the senate intelligence committee , the cia was told by an unnamed foreign intelligence service that iraq had agreed with niger in west africa to buy several hundred tons of yellowcake , the refined product from uranium ore .
subsequently , the foreign service gave the cia what was said to be the text of the contract for this sale .
since iraq had no civilian use for uranium , the fear was that it was developing a military programme in defiance of un sanctions .
vice-president cheney asked what the cia thought .
in february 2002 , the cia despatched ms plame 's husband , former us ambassador joseph wilson , to niger to investigate .
he was told to ask whether niger had been approached , had conducted talks or had made an agreement to sell uranium to " countries of concern , " which included iraq .
why was mr wilson chosen ?
the senate report says that he had been to niger for the cia in 1999 .
his name on that occasion was suggested by his wife , valerie plame , who was a covert officer in the cia 's nuclear counter-proliferation division .
the report says that interviews and documents indicated that his wife had suggested his name for this trip as well .
she then approached her husband .
mr wilson was not required to sign a confidentiality agreement .
what did mr wilson find ?
he found no evidence there had been any sale .
nigerien officials strongly denied there could have been .
for a start a french-led consortium controlled its uranium industry .
but mr wilson found an intriguing possibility that iraq might have approached niger .
this suspicion came from a former nigerien prime minister ibrahim mayaki .
he said he had been urged in 1999 by an unnamed businessman to meet an iraqi delegation which wanted to " expand commercial relations " .
as uranium was virtually the only thing niger had to sell , mr mayaki interpreted this to mean that iraq wanted to discuss yellowcake sales .
however when he actually met the delegation , mr mayaki said he steered conversation away from trade , nothing was mentioned on either side and so the issue was not resolved .
mr wilson told the senate committee staff that he had given the us ambassador in niger his view that there was " nothing to the story " .
the ambassador , the senate report says , had reached the same conclusion .
what impact did mr wilson 's report have ?
the cia felt mr wilson had added no substantial new information , but that his talk with mr mayaki had been the most interesting and important aspect .
the cia was inclined to believe that iraq might have been trying to get yellowcake from niger .
the state department continued with the more sceptical view it had expressed earlier .
the cia did not brief the vice-president , despite his earlier interest .
in september 2002 , a national intelligence estimate included a reference to reports indicating that iraq had sought uranium from africa , but this was not included in the key findings as it felt to be subsidiary to the main evidence against iraq .
lewis " scooter " libby 's trial is due to start in 2007 what about the british government claims ?
also in september 2002 , the british government published a white paper stating that " there is intelligence that iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
the british government has stuck to its position , with support from the committee chaired by the former cabinet secretary lord butler , which investigated intelligence and the iraq war .
the british sources are not known .
despite its inclination to believe the niger connection , and possible links to other african sources of uranium such as somalia , there remained doubts in the cia about how much weight should be given to the claim .
at one stage the cia said it had told congress that " the brits have exaggerated this issue . "
nevertheless it appeared in mr bush 's state of the union speech to congress in january 2003 .
why did president bush mention the british claim in his state of the union speech ?
us intelligence agencies gave less prominence to the uranium claim than did the british .
however , the claim did have some credibility in cia eyes and the national security council wanted it mentioned without revealing the cia 's own information .
so the speech simply said : " the british government has learned that saddam hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from africa . "
these are the so-called famous 16 words .
then-secretary of state colin powell did not mention uranium in his speech to the security council in february 2003 .
were the documents in the case forgeries ?
yes .
in october 2002 , elisabetta burba , an italian journalist , was given documents purporting to relate to a sale of uranium by niger to iraq .
she obtained them from rocco martino , a former sismi -lrb- italian military intelligence -rrb- employee who styled himself a " freelance intelligence agent " .
he said he got them from an employee at the nigerien embassy in rome .
suspicious , burba passed them onto to the americans .
they appear to have been the same documents which the cia was told about in 2001 .
it was not until early february 2003 , shortly before the invasion , that the us government gave these documents to the international atomic energy agency for examination .
soon afterwards a senior cia africa analyst said the documents could be fraudulent .
one us analyst had already said they looked " funky . "
the iaea quickly concluded that the documents were forgeries .
on 11 march , the cia itself said it did not " dispute " this conclusion .
on 17 june , the cia accepted that because the documents were false , it no longer believed there was " enough other reporting to conclude that iraq sought uranium from aboard . "
the source of the forgeries has not been established .
under questioning from an italian parliamentary committee , sismi has denied that it had a role in their fabrication or distribution .
when were the " 16 words " in the state of the union speech withdrawn ?
in july 2003 , the cia director george tenet said the words " should never have been included " in the speech .
" from what we know now , -lsb- cia -rsb- officials in the end concurred that the text in the speech was factually correct - ie , that the british government report said that iraq sought uranium from africa .
this should not have been the test for clearing a presidential address .
" this did not rise to the level of certainty which should be required for presidential speeches , and the cia should have ensured that it was removed . "
when did joseph wilson intervene ?
mr wilson said that the day after the state of the union speech he told the state department the statement was not borne out by the facts as he understood them .
in may 2003 , the new york times reported that an unnamed former ambassador had been to niger and reported that there had been no uranium sale and documents in the case had been forged .
in june of that year the washington post , using mr wilson as its source , reported that the former ambassador had had doubts about the uranium sale because dates and names on the contract were wrong .
in fact , mr wilson had not seen the documents and had " misspoken , " as he later put it .
but it was a sign that mr wilson had decided to go public .
joseph wilson : the former ambassador hits back he then wrote an article under his own name in the new york times on 6 july called " what i did n't find in africa . "
he concluded that it was " highly doubtful " that any sale had taken place .
and he went beyond that to attack the bush administration .
" some of the intelligence related to iraq 's nuclear weapons program was twisted to exaggerate the iraqi threat , " he wrote .
he also started to give public interviews .
why would the white house want to unmask mr wilson 's wife ?
the supposition is that it wanted to undermine wilson 's credibility by suggesting that his wife had put up his name for the niger trip as a way of enhancing his reputation and perhaps business interests .
to do this , valerie plame 's name and role had to be exposed .
however , since it now appears that richard armitage was the original source , the allegations against the white house have lost a great deal of their power .
according to the indictment against him , mr libby was critical of the cia for " selective leaking " when media stories started appearing about the niger story and had told judith miller of the new york times on 23 june 2003 that wilson 's wife might work for the cia .
he became even more active after mr wilson 's new york times article .
judith miller spent nearly three months in prison for contempt of court until she agreed to testify about her conversations with mr libby .
mr wilson himself also came under criticism .
he denied that his wife had played a substantive part in the decision to send him but she did , the senate report accepts , put up his name .
he also claimed in the washington post that he had seen documents which he had not and wrongly assumed that vice-president cheney had been briefed on his findings .
he was also accused of going public in a way that might jeopardise his wife 's position .
mr wilson remains unapologetic .
mr libby 's trial is not expected until january 2007 .
whether he will plea-bargain - that is plead guilty to some charges in exchange for a lesser sentence - is not known .

the mailings are trying to track down problem debtors but in this case the recipients merely share similar names to them we asked for your views .
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments are below . "
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance " richard , warwickshire i work as a senior manager within the debt recovery industry and as such deal with companies such as equifax as well as the other two major credit reference agencies .
it is vital that as an industry we do all we can to ensure that only the correct people are contacted in relation to unpaid debts .
however with such large volumes it is reasonable to expect that we may get it wrong in a small number of cases .
however , no action is ever taken against an individual until it has been confirmed that they are in fact the debtor .
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance , when in fact there are a lot of positives provided by our industry not only to the creditor but to the debtor too .
as an industry we have moved away from the use of scare tactics as a means to recover money and employed more of an advisory role .
that said , we do sometimes have to resort to the use of the courts when agreements can not be reached .
richard , warwickshire two years ago i was pursued by a debt collection company working on behalf of a phone provider who were chasing me for an unpaid bill of £ 351 .
i had never lived at the address specified and was living in a different area of the country at the time .
they wrote a number of very unpleasant , threatening letters and made numerous phone calls .
eventually i had to engage a solicitor to act on my behalf and after numerous letters they stopped about a year later .
the really annoying thing was that there was no apology and no compensation ever offered for the costs i incurred .
luckily enough i was in a position to be able to afford help in resolving the issue .
despite not hearing from them for a while i still live in fear of the process starting up again .
chris " they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact " robert , st neots we recently moved into a new address and started receiving debt collection letters regarding the previous tenant .
my experience is that the collection agencies use poor information , sometimes simply referring to the resident .
i can understand errors occur but it 's the tone of the letters i mainly object to .
they are often accusing and threatening , which for some people -lrb- who are not the actual debtors -rrb- could be quite worrying .
if the debt agencies are n't going to spend more time being confident about the source of their information , they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact .
robert , st neots it was suggested on the programme that you should give personal information so the debt collection agency can confirm you are not the debtor .
that seems a very dangerous response .
whoever has written the letter does not know much about you - otherwise they would not have written to you .
you ring them up and give them all the personal information they ask for .
they tell you they are very sorry - they have made a mistake and your credit record will be corrected .
you breathe a sigh of relief and get on with your life .
but how do you know you were really speaking to a real debt collection agency ?
you have just been forced to give a lot of personal information to a complete stranger - information they could use to get credit in your name .
peter , maidenhead do n't think for one moment that credit reference agencies are there to serve your interests .
they exist to serve the financial organisations , mobile phone companies , utilities , insurance and so on .
when you apply for services -lrb- such as mobile phone -rrb- they will check with other companies who have dealt with you before they decide if you 're worthy .
why should your dealings with one company be spread to a third party ?
geoff , abingdon " my concern is that many people i know would not know where to begin to counter a false claim " peter , woodbridge i received a statement claiming i was overdrawn on a bank account i did not hold to the tune of £ 1,500 .
for me it just took time , trouble and money to sort out .
i had access to a legal advice phone line and could have afforded to pay a solicitor if necessary so i never really lost any sleep over the matter .
my concern is that many people i know would not know where to begin to counter a false claim and would be ill with worry .
on the programme it was indicated that in the case mentioned the address had been obtained from the electoral roll .
i understood that the electoral roll was made available to financial organizations for a strictly limited range of purposes .
i am surprised if these purposes include helping debt recovery agencies in " fishing expeditions " .
peter , woodbridge i was phoned at least once a day for a nine month period by a debt collection agency trying to track down a debt defaulter for a bank .
the person in question had previously lived at our address .
no matter how often i explained that the debtor had sold us the house four years ago , the debt collection agency refused to believe me .
this was a period when my mother was ill -lrb- in fact , dying -rrb- and the constant phone calls were very distressing .
finally , we complained to the bank , threatened them with closing my husband 's business account and legal action if they did not instruct the debt collection agency to stop .
what was really upsetting was the way that the people at the end of the phone simply refused to believe anything we said .
shiona , dunkeld , perthshire " it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail " jt , leeds i received a letter from a card company chasing me for not paying my credit card bill .
i have never had an credit card with that company or any other card for that matter. when i rang them up they said just to ignore it .
i was very worried that i was the victim of identity theft .
fortunately this has proved not to be true but it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail .
jt , leeds the worst part is not that they get it wrong , it is that they believe that they are always right or and / or if they keep making demands , the people will do the work for them to get them off their backs .
threatening behaviour as part of what they do is the reason they have a bad reputation .
jon , bromley i have received several letters to my address , not addressed to me .
i just returned them to sender , with a note that the person concerned did not live here .
as the letters continued to arrive , i opened one and found it was from a debt recovery agency pursuing a debt of £ 381.39 on behalf of a bank and it said there would be a visit by a debt investigation officer .
i e-mailed the company immediately .
despite this , i received a further letter and an invitation to settle the debt on " favourable terms " - to pay half of it .
i wrote once more , and since then the letters finally seem to have stopped .
but it has caused me considerable anxiety , as i was concerned the debt would be linked to me and had to go to the expense of obtaining a credit report to ensure it is not the case .
also , it begs the question - why was this person able to fraudulently open an account , giving a totally incorrect address ?
elizabeth " it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud " ian , newcastle upon tyne i received a demand for a payment of £ 117.99 , from a debt recovery company .
the letter was addressed to someone called irene -lrb- wrong gender -rrb- with the same surname as mine , at my address .
this person is not at this address , is not known to me , and i had bought nothing from the company concerned .
the letter demanded payment within seven days or court action would be taken .
it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud .
thank you money box , for tackling this issue and asking tough questions of these companies .
ian , newcastle upon tyne i strongly disagree with the advice that people should give companies all the data they request when instances of false billing arise .
i have been receiving bills from a phone company addressed to someone who has never lived in my house .
on investigation , i found that the handset was sold on the swipe of a stolen card , and no check of the address was made when setting up the credit agreement .
the company is demanding my name , address , date of birth , and signature , data which they did not get from their customer .
i consider these demands an invasion of my privacy which i believe contravenes the data protection act .
sean , london i was mistakenly chased for a debt of £ 10,000 by a debt collection agency acting on behalf of a bank .
the person they were trying to contact had a similar name to me .
i received calls and letters from both the bank and debt collection agency demanding money apparently overdrawn on the account .
i had to send a copy of my birth certificate before the bank would accept i was not the person they were trying to contact .
in the end i got a written apology from the bank , a cheque for £ 100 , and a reassurance that my name had not been included in any debt register , but only after threatening to take the matter to the financial ombudsman .
i have received two further phone calls from a debt collection agency to whom i referred to the bank and my previous correspondence .
as far as i know the bank 's investigations are still ongoing .
my wife and i found the matter very stressful .
john , surrey " -lsb- debt collectors -rsb- should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused " john , canterbury i heard the advice given to someone who was wrongly targeted by a debt collector , which was to contact the debt collector with appropriate evidence of identity , and also that , for a small fee , one can check for any impact on one 's credit rating .
this seems to me wrong , however , that a victim of mistaken identity should have to pay out to clear their names .
debt collectors work for profit - it can be a lucrative industry - and i think that when it is clear that they have made a mistake they should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused .
john , canterbury i had the same thing .
i was sent a bailiff 's letter demanding £ 600 to pay a debt for speeding fines , parking fines , leaving the scene of an accident ... all in devon / staffordshire for a time when i was actually in new zealand .
it took me a whole day to clear it up .
it turned out that it was someone called something similar to me .
tom smith , york " this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual " peter thayer , oxford i discovered that two mobile phone companies had each accepted a contract from a named customer using my address .
this person is completely unknown to me , and has never lived here .
i informed both companies .
yesterday , i received a letter from a debt recovery firm , addressed to the person holding the phone contract .
once again , i contacted the phone company , and asked them to stop sending correspondence to my address .
i also expressed concern that my address had been passed to a debt recovery company .
this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual .
furthermore , i object very strongly to incorrect personal information being created , and especially to its propagation by companies trying to recover debt .
i have been reassured by both companies that my credit rating will be unaffected .
i think the least they can do is offer to pay for the credit reference companies to provide credit reports to the victims of this type of fraud .
it is after all caused by a failure in their processes for checking credit references before they accept new mobile phone contracts .
it is also a shame that the victims of this type of crime have to spend hours of their own time trying to resolve these matters .
peter , oxford we were telephoned for an entire year by a debt recovery company acting on behalf of a major company .
the callers were chasing a debt owed by a woman and had erroneously got our phone number .
we informed them time and time again that there was no-one at our address by that name .
they continued to call and became increasingly aggressive and rude .
i wrote to them but the calls continued .
i also contacted trading standards and the oft .
in the end , we changed our phone number and paid for bt 's call blocking service .
the whole experience was very distressing and caused great disruption and upset in our lives .
there appears to be no protection at all for consumers who are erroneously pursued by debt collection agencies and there is no free way for individuals to protect themselves from this form of highly intrusive attack .
alan , bexhill-on-sea the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

on the programme it was indicated that in the case mentioned the address had been obtained from the electoral roll .
i understood that the electoral roll was made available to financial organizations for a strictly limited range of purposes .
i am surprised if these purposes include helping debt recovery agencies in " fishing expeditions " .
peter , woodbridge i was phoned at least once a day for a nine month period by a debt collection agency trying to track down a debt defaulter for a bank .
the person in question had previously lived at our address .
no matter how often i explained that the debtor had sold us the house four years ago , the debt collection agency refused to believe me .
this was a period when my mother was ill -lrb- in fact , dying -rrb- and the constant phone calls were very distressing .
finally , we complained to the bank , threatened them with closing my husband 's business account and legal action if they did not instruct the debt collection agency to stop .
what was really upsetting was the way that the people at the end of the phone simply refused to believe anything we said .
shiona , dunkeld , perthshire it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail jt , leeds i received a letter from a card company chasing me for not paying my credit card bill .
i have never had an credit card with that company or any other card for that matter. when i rang them up they said just to ignore it .
i was very worried that i was the victim of identity theft .
fortunately this has proved not to be true but it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail .
jt , leeds the worst part is not that they get it wrong , it is that they believe that they are always right or and / or if they keep making demands , the people will do the work for them to get them off their backs .
threatening behaviour as part of what they do is the reason they have a bad reputation .
jon , bromley i have received several letters to my address , not addressed to me .
i just returned them to sender , with a note that the person concerned did not live here .
as the letters continued to arrive , i opened one and found it was from a debt recovery agency pursuing a debt of £ 381.39 on behalf of a bank and it said there would be a visit by a debt investigation officer .
i e-mailed the company immediately .
despite this , i received a further letter and an invitation to settle the debt on " favourable terms " - to pay half of it .
i wrote once more , and since then the letters finally seem to have stopped .
but it has caused me considerable anxiety , as i was concerned the debt would be linked to me and had to go to the expense of obtaining a credit report to ensure it is not the case .
also , it begs the question - why was this person able to fraudulently open an account , giving a totally incorrect address ?
elizabeth it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud ian , newcastle upon tyne i received a demand for a payment of £ 117.99 , from a debt recovery company .
the letter was addressed to someone called irene -lrb- wrong gender -rrb- with the same surname as mine , at my address .
this person is not at this address , is not known to me , and i had bought nothing from the company concerned .
the letter demanded payment within seven days or court action would be taken .
it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud .
thank you money box , for tackling this issue and asking tough questions of these companies .
ian , newcastle upon tyne i strongly disagree with the advice that people should give companies all the data they request when instances of false billing arise .
i have been receiving bills from a phone company addressed to someone who has never lived in my house .
on investigation , i found that the handset was sold on the swipe of a stolen card , and no check of the address was made when setting up the credit agreement .
the company is demanding my name , address , date of birth , and signature , data which they did not get from their customer .
i consider these demands an invasion of my privacy which i believe contravenes the data protection act .
sean , london i was mistakenly chased for a debt of £ 10,000 by a debt collection agency acting on behalf of a bank .
the person they were trying to contact had a similar name to me .
i received calls and letters from both the bank and debt collection agency demanding money apparently overdrawn on the account .
i had to send a copy of my birth certificate before the bank would accept i was not the person they were trying to contact .
in the end i got a written apology from the bank , a cheque for £ 100 , and a reassurance that my name had not been included in any debt register , but only after threatening to take the matter to the financial ombudsman .
i have received two further phone calls from a debt collection agency to whom i referred to the bank and my previous correspondence .
as far as i know the bank 's investigations are still ongoing .
my wife and i found the matter very stressful .
john , surrey -lsb- debt collectors -rsb- should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused john , canterbury i heard the advice given to someone who was wrongly targeted by a debt collector , which was to contact the debt collector with appropriate evidence of identity , and also that , for a small fee , one can check for any impact on one 's credit rating .
this seems to me wrong , however , that a victim of mistaken identity should have to pay out to clear their names .
debt collectors work for profit - it can be a lucrative industry - and i think that when it is clear that they have made a mistake they should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused .
john , canterbury i had the same thing .
i was sent a bailiff 's letter demanding £ 600 to pay a debt for speeding fines , parking fines , leaving the scene of an accident ... all in devon / staffordshire for a time when i was actually in new zealand .
it took me a whole day to clear it up .
it turned out that it was someone called something similar to me .
tom smith , york this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual peter thayer , oxford i discovered that two mobile phone companies had each accepted a contract from a named customer using my address .
this person is completely unknown to me , and has never lived here .
i informed both companies .
yesterday , i received a letter from a debt recovery firm , addressed to the person holding the phone contract .
once again , i contacted the phone company , and asked them to stop sending correspondence to my address .
i also expressed concern that my address had been passed to a debt recovery company .
this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual .
furthermore , i object very strongly to incorrect personal information being created , and especially to its propagation by companies trying to recover debt .
i have been reassured by both companies that my credit rating will be unaffected .
i think the least they can do is offer to pay for the credit reference companies to provide credit reports to the victims of this type of fraud .
it is after all caused by a failure in their processes for checking credit references before they accept new mobile phone contracts .
it is also a shame that the victims of this type of crime have to spend hours of their own time trying to resolve these matters .
peter , oxford we were telephoned for an entire year by a debt recovery company acting on behalf of a major company .
the callers were chasing a debt owed by a woman and had erroneously got our phone number .
we informed them time and time again that there was no-one at our address by that name .
they continued to call and became increasingly aggressive and rude .
i wrote to them but the calls continued .
i also contacted trading standards and the oft .
in the end , we changed our phone number and paid for bt 's call blocking service .
the whole experience was very distressing and caused great disruption and upset in our lives .
there appears to be no protection at all for consumers who are erroneously pursued by debt collection agencies and there is no free way for individuals to protect themselves from this form of highly intrusive attack .
alan , bexhill-on-sea the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .
readers should form their own views on whether messages published represent undeclared interests , or views prompted by a common source .

the mailings are trying to track down problem debtors but in this case the recipients merely share similar names to them we asked for your views .
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments are below .
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance richard , warwickshire i work as a senior manager within the debt recovery industry and as such deal with companies such as equifax as well as the other two major credit reference agencies .
it is vital that as an industry we do all we can to ensure that only the correct people are contacted in relation to unpaid debts .
however with such large volumes it is reasonable to expect that we may get it wrong in a small number of cases .
however , no action is ever taken against an individual until it has been confirmed that they are in fact the debtor .
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance , when in fact there are a lot of positives provided by our industry not only to the creditor but to the debtor too .
as an industry we have moved away from the use of scare tactics as a means to recover money and employed more of an advisory role .
that said , we do sometimes have to resort to the use of the courts when agreements can not be reached .
richard , warwickshire two years ago i was pursued by a debt collection company working on behalf of a phone provider who were chasing me for an unpaid bill of £ 351 .
i had never lived at the address specified and was living in a different area of the country at the time .
they wrote a number of very unpleasant , threatening letters and made numerous phone calls .
eventually i had to engage a solicitor to act on my behalf and after numerous letters they stopped about a year later .
the really annoying thing was that there was no apology and no compensation ever offered for the costs i incurred .
luckily enough i was in a position to be able to afford help in resolving the issue .
despite not hearing from them for a while i still live in fear of the process starting up again .
chris they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact robert , st neots we recently moved into a new address and started receiving debt collection letters regarding the previous tenant .
my experience is that the collection agencies use poor information , sometimes simply referring to the resident .
i can understand errors occur but it 's the tone of the letters i mainly object to .
they are often accusing and threatening , which for some people -lrb- who are not the actual debtors -rrb- could be quite worrying .
if the debt agencies are n't going to spend more time being confident about the source of their information , they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact .
robert , st neots it was suggested on the programme that you should give personal information so the debt collection agency can confirm you are not the debtor .
that seems a very dangerous response .
whoever has written the letter does not know much about you - otherwise they would not have written to you .
you ring them up and give them all the personal information they ask for .
they tell you they are very sorry - they have made a mistake and your credit record will be corrected .
you breathe a sigh of relief and get on with your life .
but how do you know you were really speaking to a real debt collection agency ?
you have just been forced to give a lot of personal information to a complete stranger - information they could use to get credit in your name .
peter , maidenhead do n't think for one moment that credit reference agencies are there to serve your interests .
they exist to serve the financial organisations , mobile phone companies , utilities , insurance and so on .
when you apply for services -lrb- such as mobile phone -rrb- they will check with other companies who have dealt with you before they decide if you 're worthy .
why should your dealings with one company be spread to a third party ?
geoff , abingdon my concern is that many people i know would not know where to begin to counter a false claim peter , woodbridge i received a statement claiming i was overdrawn on a bank account i did not hold to the tune of £ 1,500 .

john , surrey -lsb- debt collectors -rsb- should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused john , canterbury i heard the advice given to someone who was wrongly targeted by a debt collector , which was to contact the debt collector with appropriate evidence of identity , and also that , for a small fee , one can check for any impact on one 's credit rating .
this seems to me wrong , however , that a victim of mistaken identity should have to pay out to clear their names .
debt collectors work for profit - it can be a lucrative industry - and i think that when it is clear that they have made a mistake they should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused .
john , canterbury i had the same thing .
i was sent a bailiff 's letter demanding £ 600 to pay a debt for speeding fines , parking fines , leaving the scene of an accident ... all in devon / staffordshire for a time when i was actually in new zealand .
it took me a whole day to clear it up .
it turned out that it was someone called something similar to me .
tom smith , york this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual peter thayer , oxford i discovered that two mobile phone companies had each accepted a contract from a named customer using my address .
this person is completely unknown to me , and has never lived here .
i informed both companies .
yesterday , i received a letter from a debt recovery firm , addressed to the person holding the phone contract .
once again , i contacted the phone company , and asked them to stop sending correspondence to my address .
i also expressed concern that my address had been passed to a debt recovery company .
this should not have happened , since it was clear from the beginning that my address was unconnected to this individual .
furthermore , i object very strongly to incorrect personal information being created , and especially to its propagation by companies trying to recover debt .
i have been reassured by both companies that my credit rating will be unaffected .
i think the least they can do is offer to pay for the credit reference companies to provide credit reports to the victims of this type of fraud .
it is after all caused by a failure in their processes for checking credit references before they accept new mobile phone contracts .
it is also a shame that the victims of this type of crime have to spend hours of their own time trying to resolve these matters .
peter , oxford we were telephoned for an entire year by a debt recovery company acting on behalf of a major company .
the callers were chasing a debt owed by a woman and had erroneously got our phone number .
we informed them time and time again that there was no-one at our address by that name .
they continued to call and became increasingly aggressive and rude .
i wrote to them but the calls continued .
i also contacted trading standards and the oft .
in the end , we changed our phone number and paid for bt 's call blocking service .
the whole experience was very distressing and caused great disruption and upset in our lives .
there appears to be no protection at all for consumers who are erroneously pursued by debt collection agencies and there is no free way for individuals to protect themselves from this form of highly intrusive attack .
alan , bexhill-on-sea the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .
it is helpful if contributors state if they work for any organisation relevant to an issue discussed .

the mailings are trying to track down problem debtors but in this case the recipients merely share similar names to them we asked for your views .
this debate is now closed .
a selection of your comments are below .
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance richard , warwickshire i work as a senior manager within the debt recovery industry and as such deal with companies such as equifax as well as the other two major credit reference agencies .
it is vital that as an industry we do all we can to ensure that only the correct people are contacted in relation to unpaid debts .
however with such large volumes it is reasonable to expect that we may get it wrong in a small number of cases .
however , no action is ever taken against an individual until it has been confirmed that they are in fact the debtor .
i often find it frustrating when the media portray debt recovery as the big bad wolf of consumer finance , when in fact there are a lot of positives provided by our industry not only to the creditor but to the debtor too .
as an industry we have moved away from the use of scare tactics as a means to recover money and employed more of an advisory role .
that said , we do sometimes have to resort to the use of the courts when agreements can not be reached .
richard , warwickshire two years ago i was pursued by a debt collection company working on behalf of a phone provider who were chasing me for an unpaid bill of £ 351 .
i had never lived at the address specified and was living in a different area of the country at the time .
they wrote a number of very unpleasant , threatening letters and made numerous phone calls .
eventually i had to engage a solicitor to act on my behalf and after numerous letters they stopped about a year later .
the really annoying thing was that there was no apology and no compensation ever offered for the costs i incurred .
luckily enough i was in a position to be able to afford help in resolving the issue .
despite not hearing from them for a while i still live in fear of the process starting up again .
chris they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact robert , st neots we recently moved into a new address and started receiving debt collection letters regarding the previous tenant .
my experience is that the collection agencies use poor information , sometimes simply referring to the resident .
i can understand errors occur but it 's the tone of the letters i mainly object to .
they are often accusing and threatening , which for some people -lrb- who are not the actual debtors -rrb- could be quite worrying .
if the debt agencies are n't going to spend more time being confident about the source of their information , they should tone down the language of their letters , at least when initially trying making contact .
robert , st neots it was suggested on the programme that you should give personal information so the debt collection agency can confirm you are not the debtor .
that seems a very dangerous response .
whoever has written the letter does not know much about you - otherwise they would not have written to you .
you ring them up and give them all the personal information they ask for .
they tell you they are very sorry - they have made a mistake and your credit record will be corrected .
you breathe a sigh of relief and get on with your life .
but how do you know you were really speaking to a real debt collection agency ?
you have just been forced to give a lot of personal information to a complete stranger - information they could use to get credit in your name .
peter , maidenhead do n't think for one moment that credit reference agencies are there to serve your interests .
they exist to serve the financial organisations , mobile phone companies , utilities , insurance and so on .
when you apply for services -lrb- such as mobile phone -rrb- they will check with other companies who have dealt with you before they decide if you 're worthy .
why should your dealings with one company be spread to a third party ?
geoff , abingdon my concern is that many people i know would not know where to begin to counter a false claim peter , woodbridge i received a statement claiming i was overdrawn on a bank account i did not hold to the tune of £ 1,500 .
for me it just took time , trouble and money to sort out .
i had access to a legal advice phone line and could have afforded to pay a solicitor if necessary so i never really lost any sleep over the matter .
my concern is that many people i know would not know where to begin to counter a false claim and would be ill with worry .
on the programme it was indicated that in the case mentioned the address had been obtained from the electoral roll .
i understood that the electoral roll was made available to financial organizations for a strictly limited range of purposes .
i am surprised if these purposes include helping debt recovery agencies in " fishing expeditions " .
peter , woodbridge i was phoned at least once a day for a nine month period by a debt collection agency trying to track down a debt defaulter for a bank .
the person in question had previously lived at our address .
no matter how often i explained that the debtor had sold us the house four years ago , the debt collection agency refused to believe me .
this was a period when my mother was ill -lrb- in fact , dying -rrb- and the constant phone calls were very distressing .
finally , we complained to the bank , threatened them with closing my husband 's business account and legal action if they did not instruct the debt collection agency to stop .
what was really upsetting was the way that the people at the end of the phone simply refused to believe anything we said .
shiona , dunkeld , perthshire it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail jt , leeds i received a letter from a card company chasing me for not paying my credit card bill .
i have never had an credit card with that company or any other card for that matter. when i rang them up they said just to ignore it .
i was very worried that i was the victim of identity theft .
fortunately this has proved not to be true but it really made me wary and i now shred all my mail .
jt , leeds the worst part is not that they get it wrong , it is that they believe that they are always right or and / or if they keep making demands , the people will do the work for them to get them off their backs .
threatening behaviour as part of what they do is the reason they have a bad reputation .
jon , bromley i have received several letters to my address , not addressed to me .
i just returned them to sender , with a note that the person concerned did not live here .
as the letters continued to arrive , i opened one and found it was from a debt recovery agency pursuing a debt of £ 381.39 on behalf of a bank and it said there would be a visit by a debt investigation officer .
i e-mailed the company immediately .
despite this , i received a further letter and an invitation to settle the debt on " favourable terms " - to pay half of it .
i wrote once more , and since then the letters finally seem to have stopped .
but it has caused me considerable anxiety , as i was concerned the debt would be linked to me and had to go to the expense of obtaining a credit report to ensure it is not the case .
also , it begs the question - why was this person able to fraudulently open an account , giving a totally incorrect address ?
elizabeth it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud ian , newcastle upon tyne i received a demand for a payment of £ 117.99 , from a debt recovery company .
the letter was addressed to someone called irene -lrb- wrong gender -rrb- with the same surname as mine , at my address .
this person is not at this address , is not known to me , and i had bought nothing from the company concerned .
the letter demanded payment within seven days or court action would be taken .
it is quite worrying to receive one of these letters as one immediately suspects identity fraud .
thank you money box , for tackling this issue and asking tough questions of these companies .
ian , newcastle upon tyne i strongly disagree with the advice that people should give companies all the data they request when instances of false billing arise .
i have been receiving bills from a phone company addressed to someone who has never lived in my house .
on investigation , i found that the handset was sold on the swipe of a stolen card , and no check of the address was made when setting up the credit agreement .
the company is demanding my name , address , date of birth , and signature , data which they did not get from their customer .
i consider these demands an invasion of my privacy which i believe contravenes the data protection act .
sean , london i was mistakenly chased for a debt of £ 10,000 by a debt collection agency acting on behalf of a bank .
the person they were trying to contact had a similar name to me .
i received calls and letters from both the bank and debt collection agency demanding money apparently overdrawn on the account .
i had to send a copy of my birth certificate before the bank would accept i was not the person they were trying to contact .
in the end i got a written apology from the bank , a cheque for £ 100 , and a reassurance that my name had not been included in any debt register , but only after threatening to take the matter to the financial ombudsman .
i have received two further phone calls from a debt collection agency to whom i referred to the bank and my previous correspondence .
as far as i know the bank 's investigations are still ongoing .
my wife and i found the matter very stressful .
john , surrey -lsb- debt collectors -rsb- should compensate the victim for the expenses and inconvenience caused john , canterbury i heard the advice given to someone who was wrongly targeted by a debt collector , which was to contact the debt collector with appropriate evidence of identity , and also that , for a small fee , one can check for any impact on one 's credit rating .

organisers say more that 200,000 people joined saturday 's rally outside the presidential offices in taipei - but police put the number at 90,000 .
the bbc 's caroline gluck , at the scene , says it is a sea of red .
there are four big red balloons , representing righteousness , integrity , prosperity and honour .
chen protests gain ground in pictures : taiwan protests the protesters say these virtues have been lost in today 's taiwan , and mr chen should stand down .
the movement is led by shih ming-teh , a veteran activist who spent more than 25 years in jail when taiwan was under martial law .
he says he is responding to a groundswell of public discontent .
organisers say the protest is the first mass grassroots movement to remove a president that has not been organised by mainstream political parties .

last month he survived an unprecedented parliamentary attempt by the opposition kuomintang to oust him .
the crisis began in may , when mr chen 's son-in-law , chao chien-min , was detained on suspicion of insider trading .
mr chen 's wife was also accused of questionable dealings .
the president has apologised for the actions of his son-in-law .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- click -pipe- concerns over security software bbc news / click graphics version bbc sport home click -pipe- about the programme -pipe- archive -pipe- buyers ' guides -pipe- inbox -pipe- meet the team -pipe- saturday , 9 september 2006 , 12:45 gmt 13:45 uk concerns over security software by chris long click producer there are many ways to provide security , one of which is to keep harmful elements away from those parts or people they may want to damage .
exclusion is often the only way society can defend itself .
it is much the same for people that go online , where the main focus of security is keeping our data safe .
the big players like symantec , mcafee and sophos offer huge suites of programs aimed at protecting you and your computer online .
but there is an alternative .
a growing number of programs from smaller firms are aimed at the security market are available to download free of charge .
more often than not these programs are meant to entice you to upgrade to the full version , which costs money .
zone labs do just that with a free version of their firewall product , zonealarm .
but offering software gratis does more for the company than just expand its potential customer base .
" we get a lot of experience from the free version , so by having 35 millions copies of zonealarm out there we 're able to understand what is the threat environment , and provide a more secure proposition to our paid user base , " said laura yecies of zone labs .
system attacks but as you would imagine , some people - for example the manufacturers of products that you pay for - do not think it is such a good idea to trust the family data to a free security product .
" we 've seen plenty of examples where an attacker will actually create their attack either in or as part of a free security tool , " said greg day of mcafee .
" we 've seen examples where maybe you think you 've got a bit of spyware -lsb- on your computer -rsb- , something trying to steal a bit of information or some kind of attack , and you go to the internet and to try and find more and perhaps get a free tool to get rid of it .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " now maybe the good ones will actually get rid of that attack but at the same time they may drop maybe 10 or 20 other attacks onto your system . "
the bottom line , according to mr day , is that when you download free security software you can not be certain what you get .
but completely free security software may be a thing of the past when the new version of windows hits the shops early next year .
windows vista , as the new operating system is known , brings a whole new way of dealing with how data is controlled within the operating system .
essentially , programs , including microsoft 's own , will not be given the privilege to write data just anywhere on the computer as they do in xp .
" -lsb- the new -rsb- internet explorer is not able to write to the main areas of the file system , it ca n't overwrite windows , " said microsoft 's stephen lamb .
" so if i visit a website i do n't have to worry that a keylogger or a root kit , or some of these things that you hear about in the press , are going to get onto the system . "
cracking windows laura yecies of zone labs said : " microsoft is certainly making it more difficult for the independent security vendors right now .
" they 're essentially trying to take control of the security user interface functions .
" fortunately we have a pretty crack team which is finding new and innovative ways to continue to provide a very important security layer to our users . "
so the antivirus people are having to hack windows so they can get close enough to protect it .
microsoft does not see it that way , though .
" the question i would ask is ' do i want third parties , other than the manufacturers of the kernel -lrb- the core code of a computer 's operating system -rrb- that i 'm using , making changes to that ? '
because making changes , even to access controls , can have a direct impact on the reliability and integrity of the system , " said mr lamb .
" that 's really why windows vista 's been re-architected - to protect itself from external access . "
at the same time as microsoft starts closing off parts of the operating system to security software vendors , it has also released its own security product known as onecare .
the all in one package is designed to look after your computer and all your data , leaving the whole gamut of security on microsoft 's shoulders .
let us hope they are broad enough .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- click -pipe- concerns over security software home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it click highlights gadgets and guides meet the team about the programme related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 9 september 2006 , 12:45 gmt 13:45 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version concerns over security software by chris long click producer there are many ways to provide security , one of which is to keep harmful elements away from those parts or people they may want to damage .
exclusion is often the only way society can defend itself .
many companies are offering to protect our pcs for free it is much the same for people that go online , where the main focus of security is keeping our data safe .
the big players like symantec , mcafee and sophos offer huge suites of programs aimed at protecting you and your computer online .
but there is an alternative .
a growing number of programs from smaller firms are aimed at the security market are available to download free of charge .
more often than not these programs are meant to entice you to upgrade to the full version , which costs money .
zone labs do just that with a free version of their firewall product , zonealarm .
but offering software gratis does more for the company than just expand its potential customer base .
" we get a lot of experience from the free version , so by having 35 millions copies of zonealarm out there we 're able to understand what is the threat environment , and provide a more secure proposition to our paid user base , " said laura yecies of zone labs .
system attacks but as you would imagine , some people - for example the manufacturers of products that you pay for - do not think it is such a good idea to trust the family data to a free security product .
" we 've seen plenty of examples where an attacker will actually create their attack either in or as part of a free security tool , " said greg day of mcafee .
" we 've seen examples where maybe you think you 've got a bit of spyware -lsb- on your computer -rsb- , something trying to steal a bit of information or some kind of attack , and you go to the internet and to try and find more and perhaps get a free tool to get rid of it .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " now maybe the good ones will actually get rid of that attack but at the same time they may drop maybe 10 or 20 other attacks onto your system . "
the bottom line , according to mr day , is that when you download free security software you can not be certain what you get .
but completely free security software may be a thing of the past when the new version of windows hits the shops early next year .
windows vista , as the new operating system is known , brings a whole new way of dealing with how data is controlled within the operating system .
essentially , programs , including microsoft 's own , will not be given the privilege to write data just anywhere on the computer as they do in xp .
" -lsb- the new -rsb- internet explorer is not able to write to the main areas of the file system , it ca n't overwrite windows , " said microsoft 's stephen lamb .
" so if i visit a website i do n't have to worry that a keylogger or a root kit , or some of these things that you hear about in the press , are going to get onto the system . "
cracking windows laura yecies of zone labs said : " microsoft is certainly making it more difficult for the independent security vendors right now .
" they 're essentially trying to take control of the security user interface functions .
" fortunately we have a pretty crack team which is finding new and innovative ways to continue to provide a very important security layer to our users . "
so the antivirus people are having to hack windows so they can get close enough to protect it .
microsoft does not see it that way , though .
" the question i would ask is ' do i want third parties , other than the manufacturers of the kernel -lrb- the core code of a computer 's operating system -rrb- that i 'm using , making changes to that ? '
because making changes , even to access controls , can have a direct impact on the reliability and integrity of the system , " said mr lamb .
" that 's really why windows vista 's been re-architected - to protect itself from external access . "
at the same time as microsoft starts closing off parts of the operating system to security software vendors , it has also released its own security product known as onecare .
the all in one package is designed to look after your computer and all your data , leaving the whole gamut of security on microsoft 's shoulders .
let us hope they are broad enough .

" we get a lot of experience from the free version , so by having 35 millions copies of zonealarm out there we 're able to understand what is the threat environment , and provide a more secure proposition to our paid user base , " said laura yecies of zone labs .
system attacks but as you would imagine , some people - for example the manufacturers of products that you pay for - do not think it is such a good idea to trust the family data to a free security product .
" we 've seen plenty of examples where an attacker will actually create their attack either in or as part of a free security tool , " said greg day of mcafee .
" we 've seen examples where maybe you think you 've got a bit of spyware -lsb- on your computer -rsb- , something trying to steal a bit of information or some kind of attack , and you go to the internet and to try and find more and perhaps get a free tool to get rid of it .
staying safe online use anti-spyware and anti-virus programs on at least a weekly basis update anti-virus and spyware products install a firewall and make sure it is switched on make sure updates to your operating system are installed take time to educate yourself and family about the risks monitor your computer and stay alert to threats " now maybe the good ones will actually get rid of that attack but at the same time they may drop maybe 10 or 20 other attacks onto your system . "
the bottom line , according to mr day , is that when you download free security software you can not be certain what you get .
but completely free security software may be a thing of the past when the new version of windows hits the shops early next year .
windows vista , as the new operating system is known , brings a whole new way of dealing with how data is controlled within the operating system .
essentially , programs , including microsoft 's own , will not be given the privilege to write data just anywhere on the computer as they do in xp .
" -lsb- the new -rsb- internet explorer is not able to write to the main areas of the file system , it ca n't overwrite windows , " said microsoft 's stephen lamb .
" so if i visit a website i do n't have to worry that a keylogger or a root kit , or some of these things that you hear about in the press , are going to get onto the system . "
cracking windows laura yecies of zone labs said : " microsoft is certainly making it more difficult for the independent security vendors right now .
" they 're essentially trying to take control of the security user interface functions .
" fortunately we have a pretty crack team which is finding new and innovative ways to continue to provide a very important security layer to our users . "
so the antivirus people are having to hack windows so they can get close enough to protect it .
microsoft does not see it that way , though .
" the question i would ask is ' do i want third parties , other than the manufacturers of the kernel -lrb- the core code of a computer 's operating system -rrb- that i 'm using , making changes to that ? '
because making changes , even to access controls , can have a direct impact on the reliability and integrity of the system , " said mr lamb .
" that 's really why windows vista 's been re-architected - to protect itself from external access . "
at the same time as microsoft starts closing off parts of the operating system to security software vendors , it has also released its own security product known as onecare .
the all in one package is designed to look after your computer and all your data , leaving the whole gamut of security on microsoft 's shoulders .
let us hope they are broad enough .
