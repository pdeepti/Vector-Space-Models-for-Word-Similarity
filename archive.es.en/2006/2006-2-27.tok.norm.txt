no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .

regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .

a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .

" there is no ultimatum on the agenda for the moment , " noted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as he arrived for the meeting in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disappointed with belgrade : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn submitted a report to the ministers saying belgrade 's progress has fallen short of expectations .
rehn told the foreign ministers that " serbia has a few weeks more " to fully cooperate but did not set any firm deadline . british foreign secretary jack straw said that serbia 's stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- talks , seen as a first step to joining the union , were at particular risk . " if serbia continues to fail to cooperate they risk an end , a total suspension , of the talks , " shaw told reporters . war criminals still at large bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much ado about nothing : serbian media speculated wildly about mladic 's arrest a decade after the war in bosnia that claimed 200,000 lives and left more than two million homeless , the conflict 's most wanted men , former bosnian serb political leader karadzic and military chief mladic , are still on the run . both men have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague for genocide and other crimes , including ordering the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslims at the end of the 1992-1995 war . europe failed utterly to prevent the conflict , but the prospect of joining the rich 25-member club has become a powerful incentive for the economically ravaged balkans states . both men have been able to evade capture for more than a decade .
last week , serbian media reports suggested that mladic , who is believed to be hiding in serbia , had either been located , was negotiating his surrender or was already under arrest .
belgrade denied this . a carrot on a stick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers in vienna chose not to issue an ultimatum to serbia in conclusions from their talks , the eu ministers " urged both serbia and montenegro and bosnia and herzegovina to take decisive action to ensure that all remaining fugitive indictees , notably radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , are finally brought to justice without delay . " they noted that " full cooperation with the icty must be achieved to ensure that the saa negotiations are not disrupted . " serbia and the eu began negotiating the association agreement in november .
the next round of talks is scheduled for april 5 . last year , the eu delayed the start of full membership talks with croatia , another of the former yugoslav republics , for not doing enough to help the court find a major suspect , general ante gotovina .
gotovina was arrested in early december after four years on the run . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu ministers meet to discuss iran , israel and iraq eu foreign ministers are meeting in brussels on monday for a day of tough talks including serbia 's bid for union membership , israeli sanctions on the palestinian government , and the iranian nuclear program .

no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .

regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .

they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .

" i am not even a football fan .
i 'll just be glad if germany gets through the first round , but i do n't think they 'll reach the final , " he said . pure fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carnival season is considered to be a " fifth season of the year " sweets and chocolates rained down on the crowd from the floats , as marching bands played music that was upbeat if not always in tune . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east , such as in berlin where half a million people gathered for a parade on sunday . it is held before the christian season of lent , which starts on wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the business of carnival germany 's rhineland is on the cusp of its annual carnival climax , and it is not only the local jesters who are dancing a jig of joy .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

" two german intelligence agents in baghdad obtained a copy of saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital , which a german official passed on to american commanders a month before the invasion , " the new york times reported sunday citing " a classified study by the united states military . " the paper wrote on its web site that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged .
the plan gave the american military an extraordinary window into iraq 's top-level deliberations , including where and how mr. hussein planned to deploy his most loyal troops . "
an account of the german role in acquiring a copy of hussein 's plan is contained in an american military study , which focuses on iraq 's military strategy and was prepared in 2005 by the us joint forces command , the daily wrote .
support despite public oppositio n ?
after the agents received the iraqi plan , they passed it on to their superiors , the study reportedly said .
in february 2003 , a german intelligence officer in qatar gave a copy to an official from the us defense intelligence agency who worked at the wartime headquarters of gen. tommy r. franks , the overall commander , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder was vociferous in his opposition to the war german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied the allegations in berlin on monday .
he said it was not true that federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents had handed over such a plan to the us a month before the invasion . the german government was a loud critic of the bush administration 's decision to use military force to topple hussein .
while the german government has said that it had intelligence agents in baghdad during the war , it has insisted it provided only limited help to the us-led coalition . the report also said germany was not the sole case of a nation which publicly opposed the war while it " privately facilitated it , " citing egypt and saudi arabia as other examples .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward .

" russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .
" the allegation that the german intelligence gave information on saddam 's war plans to the americans is not contained in the report , " the anonymous official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in iraq a spokesman for the us joint forces command , navy captain hal pittman earlier acknowledged that the command had conducted a study of the war from the iraqi perspective , but stressed he was unaware of any references to germany providing information of iraq 's war plans . the newspaper report cited the study as saying that two german agents in baghdad had obtained the iraqi war plan and passed it up their chain of command from where another german intelligence official in qatar gave a copy of the plan to a us defense intelligence agency official assigned to the wartime headquarters of general tommy franks , commander of the us central command . " a dramatic turn " an inquiry into the exact role of the two german agents stationed in baghdad during the war on iraq has met with dissatisfaction from two of germany 's three opposition parties .
they are calling instead for a full parliamentary probe , which would allow government officials to be questioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls are growing louder for a full parliamentary probe max stadler , a deputy with the liberal free democrats , the third opposition party whose support would be needed to launch such an investigation , said that if the new york times report were true it would mark a " dramatic turn " . the party plans to decide whether or not to back the probe next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report fans controversy over bnd activity in iraq a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .

" there is no ultimatum on the agenda for the moment , " noted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as he arrived for the meeting in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disappointed with belgrade : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn submitted a report to the ministers saying belgrade 's progress has fallen short of expectations .
rehn told the foreign ministers that " serbia has a few weeks more " to fully cooperate but did not set any firm deadline . british foreign secretary jack straw said that serbia 's stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- talks , seen as a first step to joining the union , were at particular risk . " if serbia continues to fail to cooperate they risk an end , a total suspension , of the talks , " shaw told reporters . war criminals still at large bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much ado about nothing : serbian media speculated wildly about mladic 's arrest a decade after the war in bosnia that claimed 200,000 lives and left more than two million homeless , the conflict 's most wanted men , former bosnian serb political leader karadzic and military chief mladic , are still on the run . both men have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague for genocide and other crimes , including ordering the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslims at the end of the 1992-1995 war . europe failed utterly to prevent the conflict , but the prospect of joining the rich 25-member club has become a powerful incentive for the economically ravaged balkans states . both men have been able to evade capture for more than a decade .
last week , serbian media reports suggested that mladic , who is believed to be hiding in serbia , had either been located , was negotiating his surrender or was already under arrest .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

" the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .

in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .

for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .
it was seized by the authorities in 2002 along with other bronze age objects in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding germany 's temple of the sun a project to faithfully reconstruct a 7,000 year-old solar observatory , the oldest of its kind in europe , began this week at goseck in the german state of saxony .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later .

" i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .

" i am not even a football fan .
i 'll just be glad if germany gets through the first round , but i do n't think they 'll reach the final , " he said . pure fun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the carnival season is considered to be a " fifth season of the year " sweets and chocolates rained down on the crowd from the floats , as marching bands played music that was upbeat if not always in tune . carnival is a tradition stemming from catholic regions in the west and south of germany , but it is rapidly being adopted by cities in the north and east , such as in berlin where half a million people gathered for a parade on sunday . it is held before the christian season of lent , which starts on wednesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the business of carnival germany 's rhineland is on the cusp of its annual carnival climax , and it is not only the local jesters who are dancing a jig of joy .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .
" the allegation that the german intelligence gave information on saddam 's war plans to the americans is not contained in the report , " the anonymous official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in iraq a spokesman for the us joint forces command , navy captain hal pittman earlier acknowledged that the command had conducted a study of the war from the iraqi perspective , but stressed he was unaware of any references to germany providing information of iraq 's war plans . the newspaper report cited the study as saying that two german agents in baghdad had obtained the iraqi war plan and passed it up their chain of command from where another german intelligence official in qatar gave a copy of the plan to a us defense intelligence agency official assigned to the wartime headquarters of general tommy franks , commander of the us central command . " a dramatic turn " an inquiry into the exact role of the two german agents stationed in baghdad during the war on iraq has met with dissatisfaction from two of germany 's three opposition parties .
they are calling instead for a full parliamentary probe , which would allow government officials to be questioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls are growing louder for a full parliamentary probe max stadler , a deputy with the liberal free democrats , the third opposition party whose support would be needed to launch such an investigation , said that if the new york times report were true it would mark a " dramatic turn " . the party plans to decide whether or not to back the probe next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report fans controversy over bnd activity in iraq a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.02.2006 flushed with german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no business like toilet business when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .
and they like to experiment with desert-proof mascara , just for the fun of it . and all that thanks to an entrepreneurial german who made light work of life support delivery , and lived to tell about it . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from a retired first goose to bratwurst battles , from a adultery-revealing parrots to silly thieves , from german-only towns to german-friendly russians , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2005 -rrb- answering nature 's call when you 've gotta go , you 've gotta go .
yet as the 4th world toilet day in beijing this week demonstrates , finding the perfect spot for that moment of quiet relief is not always easy .

no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .

" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

" compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

the move is aimed at preventing a worsening of the palestinian authority 's dire financial situation . speaking in brussels on monday , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said the union 's executive arm would release the funds to help the palestinian authority 's transition government pay for its basic needs , such as energy bills and salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.02.2006 flushed with german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no business like toilet business when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .

the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .
and they like to experiment with desert-proof mascara , just for the fun of it . and all that thanks to an entrepreneurial german who made light work of life support delivery , and lived to tell about it . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from a retired first goose to bratwurst battles , from a adultery-revealing parrots to silly thieves , from german-only towns to german-friendly russians , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

" they noted that " full cooperation with the icty must be achieved to ensure that the saa negotiations are not disrupted . " serbia and the eu began negotiating the association agreement in november .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .

" compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .

" outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later .

" i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .
it was seized by the authorities in 2002 along with other bronze age objects in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding germany 's temple of the sun a project to faithfully reconstruct a 7,000 year-old solar observatory , the oldest of its kind in europe , began this week at goseck in the german state of saxony .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.02.2006 russia ties iran moratorium to joint enrichment deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how far will iran go in playing with nuclear fire ?
as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .
" the allegation that the german intelligence gave information on saddam 's war plans to the americans is not contained in the report , " the anonymous official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in iraq a spokesman for the us joint forces command , navy captain hal pittman earlier acknowledged that the command had conducted a study of the war from the iraqi perspective , but stressed he was unaware of any references to germany providing information of iraq 's war plans . the newspaper report cited the study as saying that two german agents in baghdad had obtained the iraqi war plan and passed it up their chain of command from where another german intelligence official in qatar gave a copy of the plan to a us defense intelligence agency official assigned to the wartime headquarters of general tommy franks , commander of the us central command . " a dramatic turn " an inquiry into the exact role of the two german agents stationed in baghdad during the war on iraq has met with dissatisfaction from two of germany 's three opposition parties .
they are calling instead for a full parliamentary probe , which would allow government officials to be questioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls are growing louder for a full parliamentary probe max stadler , a deputy with the liberal free democrats , the third opposition party whose support would be needed to launch such an investigation , said that if the new york times report were true it would mark a " dramatic turn " . the party plans to decide whether or not to back the probe next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report fans controversy over bnd activity in iraq a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.02.2006 flushed with german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no business like toilet business when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .
and they like to experiment with desert-proof mascara , just for the fun of it . and all that thanks to an entrepreneurial german who made light work of life support delivery , and lived to tell about it . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from a retired first goose to bratwurst battles , from a adultery-revealing parrots to silly thieves , from german-only towns to german-friendly russians , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2005 -rrb- answering nature 's call when you 've gotta go , you 've gotta go .
yet as the 4th world toilet day in beijing this week demonstrates , finding the perfect spot for that moment of quiet relief is not always easy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.02.2006 unions , employers mull compromise amid public-sector strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " emergency " team cleans up the streets of hamburg as germany 's state workers enter a fourth week of strikes , union and public service representatives are still trying diffuse the dispute .
one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

" two german intelligence agents in baghdad obtained a copy of saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital , which a german official passed on to american commanders a month before the invasion , " the new york times reported sunday citing " a classified study by the united states military . " the paper wrote on its web site that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged .
the plan gave the american military an extraordinary window into iraq 's top-level deliberations , including where and how mr. hussein planned to deploy his most loyal troops . "
an account of the german role in acquiring a copy of hussein 's plan is contained in an american military study , which focuses on iraq 's military strategy and was prepared in 2005 by the us joint forces command , the daily wrote .

after the agents received the iraqi plan , they passed it on to their superiors , the study reportedly said .

he said it was not true that federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents had handed over such a plan to the us a month before the invasion . the german government was a loud critic of the bush administration 's decision to use military force to topple hussein .
while the german government has said that it had intelligence agents in baghdad during the war , it has insisted it provided only limited help to the us-led coalition . the report also said germany was not the sole case of a nation which publicly opposed the war while it " privately facilitated it , " citing egypt and saudi arabia as other examples .

last week , serbian media reports suggested that mladic , who is believed to be hiding in serbia , had either been located , was negotiating his surrender or was already under arrest .
belgrade denied this . a carrot on a stick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers in vienna chose not to issue an ultimatum to serbia in conclusions from their talks , the eu ministers " urged both serbia and montenegro and bosnia and herzegovina to take decisive action to ensure that all remaining fugitive indictees , notably radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , are finally brought to justice without delay .

" serbia and the eu began negotiating the association agreement in november .
the next round of talks is scheduled for april 5 . last year , the eu delayed the start of full membership talks with croatia , another of the former yugoslav republics , for not doing enough to help the court find a major suspect , general ante gotovina .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

" there is no ultimatum on the agenda for the moment , " noted german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as he arrived for the meeting in brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disappointed with belgrade : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn submitted a report to the ministers saying belgrade 's progress has fallen short of expectations .
rehn told the foreign ministers that " serbia has a few weeks more " to fully cooperate but did not set any firm deadline . british foreign secretary jack straw said that serbia 's stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- talks , seen as a first step to joining the union , were at particular risk . " if serbia continues to fail to cooperate they risk an end , a total suspension , of the talks , " shaw told reporters . war criminals still at large bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much ado about nothing : serbian media speculated wildly about mladic 's arrest a decade after the war in bosnia that claimed 200,000 lives and left more than two million homeless , the conflict 's most wanted men , former bosnian serb political leader karadzic and military chief mladic , are still on the run . both men have been indicted by the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- in the hague for genocide and other crimes , including ordering the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslims at the end of the 1992-1995 war . europe failed utterly to prevent the conflict , but the prospect of joining the rich 25-member club has become a powerful incentive for the economically ravaged balkans states . both men have been able to evade capture for more than a decade .
last week , serbian media reports suggested that mladic , who is believed to be hiding in serbia , had either been located , was negotiating his surrender or was already under arrest .
belgrade denied this . a carrot on a stick bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign ministers in vienna chose not to issue an ultimatum to serbia in conclusions from their talks , the eu ministers " urged both serbia and montenegro and bosnia and herzegovina to take decisive action to ensure that all remaining fugitive indictees , notably radovan karadzic and ratko mladic , are finally brought to justice without delay . " they noted that " full cooperation with the icty must be achieved to ensure that the saa negotiations are not disrupted . " serbia and the eu began negotiating the association agreement in november .
the next round of talks is scheduled for april 5 . last year , the eu delayed the start of full membership talks with croatia , another of the former yugoslav republics , for not doing enough to help the court find a major suspect , general ante gotovina .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .
" the allegation that the german intelligence gave information on saddam 's war plans to the americans is not contained in the report , " the anonymous official said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops in iraq a spokesman for the us joint forces command , navy captain hal pittman earlier acknowledged that the command had conducted a study of the war from the iraqi perspective , but stressed he was unaware of any references to germany providing information of iraq 's war plans . the newspaper report cited the study as saying that two german agents in baghdad had obtained the iraqi war plan and passed it up their chain of command from where another german intelligence official in qatar gave a copy of the plan to a us defense intelligence agency official assigned to the wartime headquarters of general tommy franks , commander of the us central command . " a dramatic turn " an inquiry into the exact role of the two german agents stationed in baghdad during the war on iraq has met with dissatisfaction from two of germany 's three opposition parties .
they are calling instead for a full parliamentary probe , which would allow government officials to be questioned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calls are growing louder for a full parliamentary probe max stadler , a deputy with the liberal free democrats , the third opposition party whose support would be needed to launch such an investigation , said that if the new york times report were true it would mark a " dramatic turn " . the party plans to decide whether or not to back the probe next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report fans controversy over bnd activity in iraq a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .

" the paper wrote on its web site that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged .
the plan gave the american military an extraordinary window into iraq 's top-level deliberations , including where and how mr. hussein planned to deploy his most loyal troops . "
an account of the german role in acquiring a copy of hussein 's plan is contained in an american military study , which focuses on iraq 's military strategy and was prepared in 2005 by the us joint forces command , the daily wrote .
support despite public oppositio n ?
after the agents received the iraqi plan , they passed it on to their superiors , the study reportedly said .
in february 2003 , a german intelligence officer in qatar gave a copy to an official from the us defense intelligence agency who worked at the wartime headquarters of gen. tommy r. franks , the overall commander , according to the study .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chancellor gerhard schröder was vociferous in his opposition to the war german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm denied the allegations in berlin on monday .
he said it was not true that federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents had handed over such a plan to the us a month before the invasion . the german government was a loud critic of the bush administration 's decision to use military force to topple hussein .
while the german government has said that it had intelligence agents in baghdad during the war , it has insisted it provided only limited help to the us-led coalition . the report also said germany was not the sole case of a nation which publicly opposed the war while it " privately facilitated it , " citing egypt and saudi arabia as other examples . " egypt gave access for refueling planes , while saudi arabia allowed american special operations forces to initiate attacks from its territory , united states military officials say .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .

according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

" the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later .

this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .
it was seized by the authorities in 2002 along with other bronze age objects in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding germany 's temple of the sun a project to faithfully reconstruct a 7,000 year-old solar observatory , the oldest of its kind in europe , began this week at goseck in the german state of saxony .

while the german government has said that it had intelligence agents in baghdad during the war , it has insisted it provided only limited help to the us-led coalition . the report also said germany was not the sole case of a nation which publicly opposed the war while it " privately facilitated it , " citing egypt and saudi arabia as other examples .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.02.2006 unions , employers mull compromise amid public-sector strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an " emergency " team cleans up the streets of hamburg as germany 's state workers enter a fourth week of strikes , union and public service representatives are still trying diffuse the dispute .
one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

one proposal would entail younger employees working longer than older colleagues . the strikes , officially the largest germany has witnessed in the past decade and a half , have been gathering steam and have now spread to half of germany 's 16 federal states .
initiated by the biggest public-sector union , ver.di , the labor action has left kindergartens closed , garbage containers overflowing and non-urgent medical treatment postponed for several weeks . the dispute , which was triggered by plans to extend the current 38.5 hour working week to a straight 40 hours , is certainly having a disruptive effect .
gerhardt widder , the mayor of mannheim in the south-western federal state of baden-wuerttemberg , said he is becoming increasingly nervous . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of workers have heeded the call to strike " the strikes are being staged at the cost of ordinary citizens who have to live with the consequences of the walkouts , " widder said .
" the situation has to go back to normal , but unfortunately we are still far away from a sustainable solution to the labor conflict . " compromise solutio n both the union and employers now seem to favor a compromise solution which would require younger public-sector employees to work 18 minutes longer each day , while older colleagues would only have to work slightly longer , if at all .
but this proposal will only be debated again at length during the next central round of negotiations on march 10 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ver.di leader frank bsirske has threatened sustained action berndt keller , a labor market expert from konstanz university , said the current dispute highlights the plight of communities and regional states which have progressively fewer resources at their disposal to finance important public services .
but he added he also understands union arguments .
the latter claim that a longer working week will eventually go hand in hand with the loss of up to 250,000 public-sector jobs nation-wide . " we 're talking primarily about working hours , but the underlying issue is further job losses in the public sector , " he said , adding that although it would not happen overnight , it was a given .
" longer working hours mean that fewer people will have to be employed to do the same amount of work . " outsourci n g optio n hesse finance minister karlheinz weimar in the state of hesse meanwhile warned union representatives against a continuation of their threats to keep the strike action up for many weeks to come .
weimar has made clear his willingness to outsource garbage-collecting and other services and put them up for private tender . he said there is no reason for such services to remain in the public-sector realm forever , and added that an outsourcing of services would mean fewer problems with regard to protracted labor disputes which no-one can really afford . hardy graupner -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans look to talks amid drawn-out strike germany 's ongoing civil service strike could have widespread repercussions for unions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 27.02.2006 flushed with german pride großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no business like toilet business when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .
but gi joes and gi janes are apparently no different from the rest of us .
they like to apply clinique 's " all about eyes " - a visibly rejuvenating drop of liquid silk - to magically wipe away those nightwatch-induced dark circles .
they like to fix their hair and check on their highlights - to decide if it 's time to hop into the tank and drive over to baghdad to see that new hair stylist that everybody 's been raging about .
and they like to experiment with desert-proof mascara , just for the fun of it . and all that thanks to an entrepreneurial german who made light work of life support delivery , and lived to tell about it . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " from a retired first goose to bratwurst battles , from a adultery-revealing parrots to silly thieves , from german-only towns to german-friendly russians , we 've gathered a selection of our " from the fringe " stories so you 'll always be up to date on the quirkiest news items to come out of germany .
the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .
-lrb- dec .
1 , 2005 -rrb- answering nature 's call when you 've gotta go , you 've gotta go .
yet as the 4th world toilet day in beijing this week demonstrates , finding the perfect spot for that moment of quiet relief is not always easy .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd . " the bnd , and with it the german government , were unaware of such a plan until now , nor was the bnd aware of a meeting of saddam hussein with his commanders on december 18 , 2002 , as reported in the new york times . " explosive revelations wilhelm was referring to a meeting , according to the report , at which saddam and the top iraqi brass allegedly developed a plan to deploy his most loyal troops . the explosive article , which cited a classified report by the us military , asserted that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german intelligence officers come under increasing scrutingy over their role in iraq the center-left government under former chancellor gerhard schröder vocally opposed the us-led war in iraq , although it publicly acknowledged providing limited assistance for the us military at the time . those efforts including guarding us bases in germany to free up us troops , stationing german soldiers capable of dealing with a chemical weapons attack in kuwait and supporting nato plans to send awacs surveillance planes and patriot missiles to turkey . the german government released a report from an internal inquiry last week stating that the two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war . but the account rejected media reports that the agents had helped select bombing targets . the bnd said monday that all the reports written by the two agents during their stay in baghdad between february 15 , 2003 and may 2 , 2003 had been presented to a parliamentary supervisory committee investigating the officers ' role in january and included no mention of a baghdad defense plan . us denial on monday , a us defense official denied the claims in the new york times article .

as the clock runs down , iranian negotiators are continuing talks with their russian counterparts on a possible deal that would defuse concerns over iran ’ s nuclear ambitions .
progress has been modest , at best . russia called monday on iran to suspend uranium enrichment work , saying this was required as part of a broader plan to allay fears over tehran 's nuclear program . " the russian proposal to create a joint venture for the enrichment of uranium in russia is part of a general effort to remove concerns on the iranian nuclear program , " foreign minister sergei lavrov told journalists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister steinmeier remains skeptical " we are convinced that , among other components of this effort , a moratorium on enrichment of uranium in iran is required until all issues have been clarified by the experts " of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , he added . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , however , reacted skeptically to the prospects of a breaktrhough . " iran does not really have a new strategy , " steinmeier said .
" they still want to drive a wedge into the international community , but will not succeed . " the iaea board of governors meets on march 6 to decide whether to refer iran to the un security council over its nuclear program . a special case lavrov 's comments provided one of the clearest indications to date that russia was in line with the european union and the united states in diplomatic efforts to persuade iran to compromise in granting a measure of international control over the most sensitive aspects of its nuclear program . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power station but shares western concerns that tehran may use its civilian nuclear program to camouflage plans to build nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reactor building of iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant while vehemently denying his , iran insists on total control over the uranium enrichment process which can be used to produce both nuclear fuel and the core ingredient of nuclear bombs . iran says it is entitled to an independent nuclear energy program like any other country that has signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty .
the west says the fact that it hid parts of its nuclear program for 18 years and has called for israel to be " erased " make iran a special case . the russian proposal , under which moscow and tehran would establish a joint venture located on russian soil and under russian control for the purpose of enriching uranium for the islamic republic 's nuclear power stations , is backed by the united states and the european union . threats from teheran fears over iran 's nuclear designs were heightened last september when tehran announced it was ending a voluntary two-year moratorium on uranium enrichment work .
the iaea has called on iran to return to that moratorium pending further investigation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign minister lavrov is mediating between iran and the west iran balked again monday at calls for it to back down in its standoff with russia and the west , with a senior nuclear negotiator quoted by state television saying tehran saw " no reason " to do so . lavrov 's comments came after other russian officials downplayed progress on the russian compromise plan , saying there was still work to be done to reach agreement and warning that time was quickly running out ahead of a march 6 deadline . " this is a complex issue and the negotiations are difficult , " russia 's chief nuclear negotiator with iran , sergei kiriyenko , told the official itar-tass news agency in an interview on his return to moscow following weekend talks in tehran . " there is little time left for further agreements , " he said . a half-step forward itar-tass quoted an unnamed source within the russian delegation sent to iran for the weekend talks as saying their result amounted to " a small half-step forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president mahmoud ahmadinejad is known for his explosive rhetoric tehran was still insisting that all scientific research and development work on uranium enrichment be carried out within iran , a condition which the source said " defeats the very purpose of the joint venture " for uranium enrichment in russia . " russia can not go forward with creation of a joint venture under such terms , " the source said . negotiations between iran and russia will resume tuesday in moscow , a senior russian official told afp on monday . the official , speaking on condition he not be named , said ali husseini tash , deputy chief of iran 's national security council and one of the islamic republic 's top nuclear negotiators , " will be in moscow tomorrow for talks with the russian security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.02.2006 bronze age sky disc deciphered großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 3,600 years ago , this sky disc was used as an astronomical clock a group of german scientists has deciphered the meaning of one of the most spectacular archeological discoveries in recent years : the mystery-shrouded sky disc of nebra was used as an advanced astronomical clock . the purpose of the 3,600 year-old sky disc of nebra , which caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , is no longer a matter of speculation . a group of german scholars who studied this archaeological gem has discovered evidence which suggests that the disc was used as a complex astronomical clock for the harmonization of solar and lunar calendars . " this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .

a us defense official has echoed germany 's denial that it provided american commanders with intelligence on saddam hussein 's plans to defend baghdad one month before us-led forces invaded iraq . a new york times article stating that two german spies in baghdad had obtained and passed on a copy of saddam 's baghdad defense plan was untrue , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm told reporters at a tightly-packed press conference . " the claim that the two bnd officers had acquired saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital and handed it to the us one month before the war 's outbreak , as it states in the new york times report , is false , " he said , referring to the german foreign intelligence agency or bnd .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

" we have reached an agreement in principle for the creation of a joint company , " vice president gholam reza aghazadeh said in a joint news conference with russia 's visiting atomic energy chief sergei kiriyenko . moscow 's compromise plan would keep sensitive enrichment work - which can be extended to make the fissile core of a weapon - outside iran , yet at the same time guarantee its access to reactor fuel needed to generate electricity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's bushehr nuclear power plant " we have made progress , " aghazadeh said .
" we think we can get an outcome which will be satisfying for the march 6 meeting , " he added , referring to the next session of the 35-nation board of the international atomic energy agency - which could call for security council action .
but kiriyenko , who did not appear so upbeat , emphasized the proposal was " complex " and that " more work needs to be done . " the eu ministers are expected to discuss the outcome of the talks between russian and iran and to warn teheran that it must be cautious in its enrichment activities , which have raised concern that it is trying to develop an atomic weapon , if it wishes to avoid further deterioration of its relationship with the eu .
caution reigns so far , european leaders have been reserved in their reactions to ostensible agreement between iran and russia .
" all reports refer to iranian sources .
we must see whether that 's reliable , " commented german foreign minister steinmeier on monday in brussels .
he said he was pleased that the talks between tehran and moscow were continuing , but that it would not be clear whether there really was an agreement until information was available from the russian side .
ministers were hopeful that they would receive news on monday .
eu foreign policy chief javier solana was also guarded .
" we must be cautious .
we need more information .
the talks are not yet over . "
" we have heard very different comments from the iranian and russian sides , " said eu foreign relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
according to the russians , the two parties have only been able to agree on details , she said . war n i n g to serbia in discussions about the balkans , the ministers are expected to endorse a report by eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn noting that serbia is not fully cooperating with the un 's war crimes court in the hague .
amid speculation that a top war crimes indictee , bosnian serb military chief ratko mladic , may have been arrested last week in serbia , the ministers will warn belgrade of the need for decisive action to bring suspects to justice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanted : ratko mladic the eu and serbia began talks in november on a stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- , seen as a first step toward eu membership .
rehn is likely to suggest that the talks progress are linked to belgrade 's cooperation . " if there is no full cooperation anytime soon , these negotiations can not just continue as if nothing had happened , " an eu official said , and hinted that the next round of saa talks on april 5 could be cancelled . deali n g with israeli sa n ctio n s the 25 ministers are also expected to discuss how to help the palestinian government meet its payments since israel decided to sanction it by withholding around 71 million euros -lrb- $ 60 million -rrb- a month in taxes and duties . the sanctions came as the militant group hamas , which has launched most of the attacks on israel and figures on the eu 's terror black list , was asked to form the next government .
the ministers are not expected to take a clear position on hamas until the new government is formed and its position on recognizing israel , renouncing violence and working peacefully for a two-state solution is made clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mahmoud abbas but they are likely to discuss ways to fund the outgoing government led by president mahmoud abbas . " there is very active consideration being given to how we respond to the needs and the constraints of the current situation within the palestinian territories , " another eu official said . support for iraq iraq 's possible descent into civil war will also feature high on the agenda following the bombing of a revered shiite muslim shrine in samarra on wednesday and revenge attacks on sunni mosques and people which have left some 140 people dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis rally at the ruins of a shiite shrine in samarra the bloodshed only slowed after an unprecedented daytime curfew was imposed on baghdad and three central provinces on friday , the muslim day of prayer . " we do think that these kinds of attacks are intended to trigger fighting along religious-sectarian lines and therefore we support extremely warmly those political and religious leaders who have come out to try and calm down the situation , " an eu official said . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran hopeful about russian nuclear compromise plan iranian officials said tuesday they were hopeful a russian compromise to end the crisis over iran 's nuclear program would bear fruit , also hinting that they attached greater weight to it than to talks with the eu-3 .

" two german intelligence agents in baghdad obtained a copy of saddam hussein 's plan to defend the iraqi capital , which a german official passed on to american commanders a month before the invasion , " the new york times reported sunday citing " a classified study by the united states military . " the paper wrote on its web site that " in providing the iraqi document , german intelligence officials offered more significant assistance to the united states than their government has publicly acknowledged .
the plan gave the american military an extraordinary window into iraq 's top-level deliberations , including where and how mr. hussein planned to deploy his most loyal troops . "

after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .

no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere . two germans called karl-friedrich krause have been immortalized by history .
one was a famous 19th-century anatomist who revolutionized his discipline by using the microscope in his investigations .
he gave us names for the accessory tear glands -lrb- krause 's glands -rrb- and the transverse perineal ligament -lrb- krause 's ligament -rrb- . the other karl-friedrich krause is our contemporary , living happily and prosperously in the southern german town of regensburg .
several times a day - come rain or snow , sandstorm or drought , bombs or grenades - this karl-friedrich krause puts a smile on the faces of hundreds of thousands of american soldiers around the world . he delivers mobile toilets . and they sell like hot cakes . classified i n formatio n he ca n't really talk about the details .
regulating the gastrointestinal discharge of the us forces is part of " life support " and therefore - quite understandably - a top secret mission that only top pentagon officials are privy to . " americans are very sensitive about that , " krause recently told the german magazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a toilet all right , but is it art ?
in fact , americans are sensitive in general .
after germany refused to be part of gee dubya 's mission in iraq , german companies had to kiss goodbye a number of get-rich-quick schemes that euphemistically pass for postwar reconstruction effort . krause , however , is the george clooney of the mobile toilet business .
he is the chamber pot deliverer of choice to everybody from the pentagon to afghanistan .
and he 's been around since the ' 90s , when he brought the joy of mobile toilets to the international forces in bosnia and gave a new twist to the phrase " relief work . " it also did n't hurt him that his company has a hungarian subsidiary .
the us forces swallowed their hard-earned pride and magnanimously let a kraut be responsible for an important and fun part of their lives . so , after krause 's glands and krause 's ligament , we are now blessed with krause 's toilet as well . but would you wa n t o n e ? the esthetics of the portable john leave something to be desired .
krause 's company web site describes their toilet styling as " contemporary " with " an eye-catching exterior and roomy interior , " but you would never mistake a plastic booth in the middle of the desert for a giant ipod . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile toilets in cologne saw many celebrities during carnival , including darth vader and although you 'd wish the portable cans had been designed by apple 's jonathan ives , you ca n't deny how practical they are .
the wash basin has a capacity for 24 liters -lrb- 6 gallons -rrb- of fresh water ; the seats have a spring mechanism which always returns to upright position , providing extra hygiene .
a large ventilation pipe lets the bad odor escape into the desert . which means you definitely do n't want to be caught hanging out anywhere near the places where american heroes leave their unmentionables : a portable toilet is a get-in , get-out and run-as-far-as-you-can kind of venue . but desert lavatories also have a couple of surprise stored for you .
for example , they offer bigger-sized toilet paper - not because herr krause wants to make a statement about the size of military bottoms , but because his toilet vision is that of a comfortable place for relaxation and meditation . beauty is i n the eye of the beholder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they know where to go when nature calls and while the wash basin in the desert bathroom is rather tiny , it has a decent-sized mirror hanging above it . you may wonder why you 'd need a mirror if you 're wearing full combat gear in the middle of the desert .

" this is a clear expansion of what we knew about the meaning and function of the sky disc , " said archeologist harald meller . a thirteenth month ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was not all moonshine unlike the solar calendar , which indicates the position of the earth as it revolves around the sun , the lunar calendar is based on the phases of the moon .
a lunar year is eleven days shorter than the solar year because 12 synodic months , or 12 returns of the moon to the new phase , take only 354 days . the sky disc of nebra was used to determine if and when a thirteenth month - the so-called intercalary month - should be added to a lunar year to keep the lunar calendar in sync with the seasons . " the functioning of this clock was probably known to a very small group of people , " meller said . bronze age science bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a slice of prehistory for romantic sky gazers the 32-centimeter-wide -lrb- 12.6-inch -rrb- bronze disc with gold-leaf appliqués representing the sun , the moon , and the stars is the oldest visual representation of the cosmos known to date . a cluster of seven dots has previously been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago . the explanation of the disc 's purpose sheds new light on the astronomical knowledge and abilities of the bronze age people , who used a combination of solar and lunar calendars as important indicators for agricultural seasons and passage of time . " the sensation lies in the fact that the bronze age people managed to harmonize the solar and lunar years .
we never thought they would have managed that , " meller said . according to astronomer wolfhard schlosser of the rurh university at bochum , the bronze age sky gazers already knew what the babylonians would describe only a thousand years later . " whether this was a local discovery , or whether the knowledge came from afar , is still not clear , " schlosser said . from saxony-anhalt to babylon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was found near europe 's oldest observatory in goseck ever since the disc was discovered , archaeologists and astronomers have been puzzled by the shape of the moon as it appears on the disc . " i wanted to explain the thickness of the crescent on the sky disc of nebra because it is not a new moon phase , " said hamburg astronomer ralph hansen . in his quest to explain why the nebra astronomers created a sky map with a four or five days old moon on it , hansen consulted the " mul-apin " collection of babylonian documents from the 7th and 6th centuries b.c. these cuneiform writings represent , according to hansen , a compendium of " astronomic knowledge from the earliest times . "
they also contain a calculation rule for the crescent that looks strikingly similar to the one from nebra . according to the ancient babylonian rule , a thirteenth month should only be added to the lunar calendar only when one sees the constellation of the moon and the pleiades exactly as they appear on the nebra sky disc . knowledge comes and goes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky disc of nebra was first discovered by treasure hunters the bronze age astronomers would hold the nebra clock against the sky and observe the position of the celestial objects .
the intercalary month was inserted when what they saw in the sky corresponded to the map on the disc they were holding in their hands .
this happened every two to three years . but the german researchers also discovered that in the 400 years that the disc was in use , its status had evolved .
the perforations on the edge of the object as well as a ship that was later added to the map suggest that the knowledge about the lunar calendar 's shortage of days was lost along the way . " that means , that in the end the disk became a cult object , " meller said . the disc was found in 1999 by two previously convicted treasure looters .
it was seized by the authorities in 2002 along with other bronze age objects in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : rebuilding germany 's temple of the sun a project to faithfully reconstruct a 7,000 year-old solar observatory , the oldest of its kind in europe , began this week at goseck in the german state of saxony .

dubai ports world -lrb- dpw -rrb- aims to appease miami-based eller & co , which will try to block the controversial £ 3.9bn -lrb- $ 6.8bn -rrb- takeover bid .
leading critic democratic senator hillary clinton has praised the review but criticised the us president 's role .
dubai ports -lrb- dpw -rrb- has said it was surprised by the outcry over the bid .
' lacking leadership ' republican and democrat politicians have criticised the transaction , which would hand control of six us ports to dpw , based in the united arab emirates , claiming it would make the country more vulnerable to terrorism .
the senators also believe they have not been sufficiently consulted over an agreement that would hand over the management of six ports to the dubai-based company .
the us firm eller & co has lodged a petition in london 's high court , saying the buyout would harm its interests . "
we consider our company to be a friend of the united states " michael moore , dubai ports world while backing the review , senator clinton continued to criticise president bush .
she accused him of lacking leadership over the issue of homeland security and stressed that the review must be carried out in a rigorous and independent manner .
dpw , while agreeing to the security investigation prior to the deal , is still determined to proceed with the acquisition .
the company will also set up a separate subsidiary to run the ports , distanced from its owners .
" we consider our company to be a friend of the united states , " michael moore , a company executive told bbc five live .
" we are simply trying to be helpful , " he said of the 45-day review .
" it is clear that the nature of who we are , our operations and responsibilities is clearly being misunderstood . "
concessions the company had already agreed not to take over the management of the us ports until security issues had been fully addressed .
however , this has not deterred critics of the deal .
new jersey officials are taking legal action to try and block the deal , while the port authority of new york and new jersey is seeking to annul p & o 's 30-year operating licence , claiming it failed to seek permission for the transfer of ownership .
us ports owned by p & o new york , new jersey , baltimore , new orleans , miami , philadelphia the deal had been expected to be formally sanctioned in a hearing in the high court on monday .
however , a judge is now expected to hear eller & co 's petition to have the deal blocked , made late on friday evening .
eller , which provides stevedoring services at the port of miami , is expected to argue that the deal could be revoked in the us and that it breaches contractual agreements it has with p & o.
' licence threat ' " there is a real prospect that the arrangement will lead to us port authorities revoking licences and leases held by joint venture companies which will cause sever financial losses , " its petition states .
dubai ports world said it was " fully committed " to the deal , which would make it the world 's third largest port operator .
the bush administration is backing the takeover , arguing that it poses no threat to us security interests .
however , it has supported plans to allow more time for congress to be briefed on the details of the transaction .
when republicans and democrats alike vowed legislation that would force a review of national security issues surrounding it , the president 's national security adviser responded that such negotiations were between congress and the company .
he said the white house was simply willing to go along with their conclusion as long as it did not block the deal .

dubai ports -lrb- dpw -rrb- has said it was surprised by the outcry over the bid .
' lacking leadership ' republican and democrat politicians have criticised the transaction , which would hand control of six us ports to dpw , based in the united arab emirates , claiming it would make the country more vulnerable to terrorism .
the senators also believe they have not been sufficiently consulted over an agreement that would hand over the management of six ports to the dubai-based company .
the us firm eller & co has lodged a petition in london 's high court , saying the buyout would harm its interests .
we consider our company to be a friend of the united states michael moore , dubai ports world while backing the review , senator clinton continued to criticise president bush .
she accused him of lacking leadership over the issue of homeland security and stressed that the review must be carried out in a rigorous and independent manner .
dpw , while agreeing to the security investigation prior to the deal , is still determined to proceed with the acquisition .
the company will also set up a separate subsidiary to run the ports , distanced from its owners .
" we consider our company to be a friend of the united states , " michael moore , a company executive told bbc five live .
" we are simply trying to be helpful , " he said of the 45-day review .
" it is clear that the nature of who we are , our operations and responsibilities is clearly being misunderstood . "
concessions the company had already agreed not to take over the management of the us ports until security issues had been fully addressed .
however , this has not deterred critics of the deal .
new jersey officials are taking legal action to try and block the deal , while the port authority of new york and new jersey is seeking to annul p & o 's 30-year operating licence , claiming it failed to seek permission for the transfer of ownership .
us ports owned by p & o new york , new jersey , baltimore , new orleans , miami , philadelphia the deal had been expected to be formally sanctioned in a hearing in the high court on monday .
however , a judge is now expected to hear eller & co 's petition to have the deal blocked , made late on friday evening .
eller , which provides stevedoring services at the port of miami , is expected to argue that the deal could be revoked in the us and that it breaches contractual agreements it has with p & o.
' licence threat ' " there is a real prospect that the arrangement will lead to us port authorities revoking licences and leases held by joint venture companies which will cause sever financial losses , " its petition states .
dubai ports world said it was " fully committed " to the deal , which would make it the world 's third largest port operator .
the bush administration is backing the takeover , arguing that it poses no threat to us security interests .
however , it has supported plans to allow more time for congress to be briefed on the details of the transaction .
when republicans and democrats alike vowed legislation that would force a review of national security issues surrounding it , the president 's national security adviser responded that such negotiations were between congress and the company .
he said the white house was simply willing to go along with their conclusion as long as it did not block the deal .

here , he talks us through his impressions of his stay at milton margai school , day by day .
his trip turned out to be life-changing experience .
saturday : arrivals my first impressions of sierra leone , the ones i managed to get after a whole day 's travelling , were brilliant .
the welcome we got at the school was tremendous - i 've never seen anything like it in my life .
and i 've met my friend ibrahim again who i 've been writing to for the last three years .
truly , when i meet him and i speak to him , it 's as if we have n't been apart .
it seems like nothing has happened since we last saw each other : . we can catch up just like that .
there 's no ' oh what shall i say next . '
when we 're quiet we 're quiet and when we 're talking we 're talking , monday : meeting the ministers .
today i met the ministers .
it was very nerve-wracking as i did n't know what to expect .
i had to actually speak about what i got out of the link between our two schools .
i said how i felt i 'd been helped by the link .
a lot has come out of it for both me and ibrahim .
we both spoke about how we became friends .
tuesday : pop-stars sierra-leone style today i went to the singing competition that takes place between the local schools .
i supported milton margai school for the blind .
they sang will young 's evergreen and they should have won .
the judges did n't beat about the bush .
they tore shreds out of them and that 's an understatement .
you would n't get that kind of judging in britain back home , they sugar the pill and say yeah but no but and take half an hour to say something that should take five minutes .
wednesday : art lessons where 's the time going man ?
it 's all going so quickly - i ca n't believe we 've been here since saturday .
art classes mean making a tactile map like this today i took part in an art class .
it was fascinating to see how they went about teaching something that had never been taught before to pupils who had no idea of art whatsoever .
it 's all very well to say art is making things but if you 've never done it before , you 're going to say making what ?
thursday : big john and esther - two remarkable people today was quite amazing .
first we met big john , who 's a blind record producer .
i think we 've got a lot to learn from people like him .
he began with nothing and he 's gone on to great things i think it shows that if you want something badly enough then you 'll get it , whether its tomorrow or next year or the year after .
i was talking to one girl at the school , esther , whose house was bombed in the civil war .
it really upset me .
they killed her father and a lot of her friends .
the thing that surprised me the most is that she 's not angry about it any more .
i would certainly be angry for years .
i would never forgive something like that .
friday : final thoughts i came here expecting things that did n't happen .
nothing was as i expected - and it 's world 's apart from what i 've experienced before .
it 's important to have these links between black and white nations .
a lot of people out here take a lot of interest in us : they look at us .
i scared a two year old off yesterday without meaning to .
they 'd never seen a white person before - took one look at me and ran away .
so if you have these links going on between sierra leone and britain , it 's a giant step closer to wiping out racial problems in the world .
everyone 's the same whether they live in a rich country or a poor one .

here , he talks us through his impressions of his stay at milton margai school , day by day .
his trip turned out to be life-changing experience .
saturday : arrivals my first impressions of sierra leone , the ones i managed to get after a whole day 's travelling , were brilliant .
the welcome we got at the school was tremendous - i 've never seen anything like it in my life .
and i 've met my friend ibrahim again who i 've been writing to for the last three years .
truly , when i meet him and i speak to him , it 's as if we have n't been apart .
it seems like nothing has happened since we last saw each other : . we can catch up just like that .
there 's no ' oh what shall i say next . '
when we 're quiet we 're quiet and when we 're talking we 're talking , monday : meeting the ministers .
today i met the ministers .
it was very nerve-wracking as i did n't know what to expect .
i had to actually speak about what i got out of the link between our two schools .
i said how i felt i 'd been helped by the link .
a lot has come out of it for both me and ibrahim .
we both spoke about how we became friends .
tuesday : pop-stars sierra-leone style today i went to the singing competition that takes place between the local schools .
i supported milton margai school for the blind .
they sang will young 's evergreen and they should have won .
the judges did n't beat about the bush .
they tore shreds out of them and that 's an understatement .
you would n't get that kind of judging in britain back home , they sugar the pill and say yeah but no but and take half an hour to say something that should take five minutes .
wednesday : art lessons where 's the time going man ?
it 's all going so quickly - i ca n't believe we 've been here since saturday .
art classes mean making a tactile map like this today i took part in an art class .
it was fascinating to see how they went about teaching something that had never been taught before to pupils who had no idea of art whatsoever .
it 's all very well to say art is making things but if you 've never done it before , you 're going to say making what ?
thursday : big john and esther - two remarkable people today was quite amazing .
first we met big john , who 's a blind record producer .
i think we 've got a lot to learn from people like him .
he began with nothing and he 's gone on to great things i think it shows that if you want something badly enough then you 'll get it , whether its tomorrow or next year or the year after .
i was talking to one girl at the school , esther , whose house was bombed in the civil war .
it really upset me .
they killed her father and a lot of her friends .
the thing that surprised me the most is that she 's not angry about it any more .
i would certainly be angry for years .
i would never forgive something like that .
friday : final thoughts i came here expecting things that did n't happen .
nothing was as i expected - and it 's world 's apart from what i 've experienced before .
it 's important to have these links between black and white nations .
a lot of people out here take a lot of interest in us : they look at us .
i scared a two year old off yesterday without meaning to .
they 'd never seen a white person before - took one look at me and ran away .
so if you have these links going on between sierra leone and britain , it 's a giant step closer to wiping out racial problems in the world .
everyone 's the same whether they live in a rich country or a poor one .

wednesday : art lessons where 's the time going man ?
it 's all going so quickly - i ca n't believe we 've been here since saturday .
art classes mean making a tactile map like this today i took part in an art class .
it was fascinating to see how they went about teaching something that had never been taught before to pupils who had no idea of art whatsoever .
it 's all very well to say art is making things but if you 've never done it before , you 're going to say making what ?
thursday : big john and esther - two remarkable people today was quite amazing .
first we met big john , who 's a blind record producer .
i think we 've got a lot to learn from people like him .
he began with nothing and he 's gone on to great things i think it shows that if you want something badly enough then you 'll get it , whether its tomorrow or next year or the year after .
i was talking to one girl at the school , esther , whose house was bombed in the civil war .
it really upset me .
they killed her father and a lot of her friends .
the thing that surprised me the most is that she 's not angry about it any more .
i would certainly be angry for years .
i would never forgive something like that .
friday : final thoughts i came here expecting things that did n't happen .
nothing was as i expected - and it 's world 's apart from what i 've experienced before .
it 's important to have these links between black and white nations .
a lot of people out here take a lot of interest in us : they look at us .
i scared a two year old off yesterday without meaning to .
they 'd never seen a white person before - took one look at me and ran away .
so if you have these links going on between sierra leone and britain , it 's a giant step closer to wiping out racial problems in the world .
everyone 's the same whether they live in a rich country or a poor one .
it 's not the amount you have , it 's the person you are which matters - and every person is the same as everyone else .

dermatology is the branch of medicine that deals with the care of the skin and conditions and disorders associated with it .
dr clayton 's cv what is your job ?
i am a specialist registrar in dermatology -lrb- a skin specialist -rrb- , at leeds general infirmary .
i see and treat skin disorders .
essentially dermatologists get referred any patient with a problem with their skin , from acne or psoriasis , to weird and wonderful skin rashes , skin cancers and disorders of the hair .
what is the most common condition ?
the most common conditions we treat are acne , eczema and psoriasis .
people with these conditions might be treated by their gp , but if they have failed to respond to treatment or it gets much worse than normal they will be referred to us by their gp .
it is a bit like plastic surgery , but not as exotic dr tim clayton we also get referred cases of acute skin problems like urticaria -lrb- a severe outbreak of itchy hives -rrb- or angioedema -lrb- which causes swelling -rrb- .
we can also get referred allergic rashes to prescribed drugs , people who have used hair dyes that they are allergic to .
they might have a serious allergic reaction and we have to see them urgently through accident and emergency .
if they have a reaction to a new drug it can be a few spots or their skin can start to peel off .
we also get referred a lot of skin cancers , which are the bulk of our work .
we get not only the melanomas , but the age related skin cancers as well .
what is the most common procedure ?
we do biopsies and we also remove skin cancers .
and when we do that we sometimes have to do grafts to cover the holes where the tumour was .
it is a bit like plastic surgery , but not as exotic .
what is the hardest thing about your job ?
i think sometimes the skin cancer clinics can be quite a hard part .
if you have to tell somebody that they have a skin cancer , particularly if they are quite young .
that can be upsetting .
but apart from that there is very little that i do not enjoy about the job .
and even skin cancer clinics can be rewarding when you tell somebody they might have a cancer and then you find they do n't .
what is your most satisfying case ?
i particularly enjoy managing successfully children with severe eczema who have previously had numerous treatments and been quite poorly and then we get their eczema under control .
also we had one man who was in his 40s who has psoriasis and awful problems with his skin .
he had been to his doctor and had topical creams and phototherapy treatment , but none of these had worked and then he tried the new treatments and within a few months they started to work .
why did you choose this specialt ?
i think there are lots of reasons .
we see patients in the wards and around the hospital so we see them in all situations .
we have lots of treatment options and we are even able to do surgery , .
we can remove something from someone 's face and then when we see them a few months later and there is no trace of it and that is rewarding .
there is quite a lot of satisfaction in seeing the patients improve .
you can see the organ you are treating unlike most of the other specialties .
i think it is one of the busiest specialties during the day , but there is not much night work .
if you had your time again would you change your specialty ?
i would not change it at all .
i am very happy .
how do you see the role developing in the future ?
i think it is important that this specialty remains a hospital specialism , because the patients with skin cancer and life threatening skin diseases should be managed in the hospital .
i am worried that we might be moved out into the community and lose our hospital beds , gps with special interests in subjects like dermatology have an important role , but seeing one of these is not to be confused with seeing a dermatologist .

dr clayton 's cv what is your job ?
i am a specialist registrar in dermatology -lrb- a skin specialist -rrb- , at leeds general infirmary .
i see and treat skin disorders .
essentially dermatologists get referred any patient with a problem with their skin , from acne or psoriasis , to weird and wonderful skin rashes , skin cancers and disorders of the hair .
what is the most common condition ?
the most common conditions we treat are acne , eczema and psoriasis .
people with these conditions might be treated by their gp , but if they have failed to respond to treatment or it gets much worse than normal they will be referred to us by their gp .
it is a bit like plastic surgery , but not as exotic dr tim clayton we also get referred cases of acute skin problems like urticaria -lrb- a severe outbreak of itchy hives -rrb- or angioedema -lrb- which causes swelling -rrb- .
we can also get referred allergic rashes to prescribed drugs , people who have used hair dyes that they are allergic to .
they might have a serious allergic reaction and we have to see them urgently through accident and emergency .
if they have a reaction to a new drug it can be a few spots or their skin can start to peel off .
we also get referred a lot of skin cancers , which are the bulk of our work .
we get not only the melanomas , but the age related skin cancers as well .
what is the most common procedure ?
we do biopsies and we also remove skin cancers .
and when we do that we sometimes have to do grafts to cover the holes where the tumour was .
it is a bit like plastic surgery , but not as exotic .
what is the hardest thing about your job ?
i think sometimes the skin cancer clinics can be quite a hard part .
if you have to tell somebody that they have a skin cancer , particularly if they are quite young .
that can be upsetting .
but apart from that there is very little that i do not enjoy about the job .
and even skin cancer clinics can be rewarding when you tell somebody they might have a cancer and then you find they do n't .
what is your most satisfying case ?
i particularly enjoy managing successfully children with severe eczema who have previously had numerous treatments and been quite poorly and then we get their eczema under control .
also we had one man who was in his 40s who has psoriasis and awful problems with his skin .
he had been to his doctor and had topical creams and phototherapy treatment , but none of these had worked and then he tried the new treatments and within a few months they started to work .
why did you choose this specialt ?
i think there are lots of reasons .
we see patients in the wards and around the hospital so we see them in all situations .
we have lots of treatment options and we are even able to do surgery , .
we can remove something from someone 's face and then when we see them a few months later and there is no trace of it and that is rewarding .
there is quite a lot of satisfaction in seeing the patients improve .
you can see the organ you are treating unlike most of the other specialties .
i think it is one of the busiest specialties during the day , but there is not much night work .
if you had your time again would you change your specialty ?
i would not change it at all .
i am very happy .
how do you see the role developing in the future ?
i think it is important that this specialty remains a hospital specialism , because the patients with skin cancer and life threatening skin diseases should be managed in the hospital .
i am worried that we might be moved out into the community and lose our hospital beds , gps with special interests in subjects like dermatology have an important role , but seeing one of these is not to be confused with seeing a dermatologist .

clare bernal , 22 , was at work in the perfumery department of the store in knightsbridge last september , where her ex-boyfriend shot her dead .
michael pech had pleaded guilty to harassment but was awaiting sentence .
" the danger signs were there but they were not taken seriously enough , " said clare 's mother patricia , from kent .
clare had a brief fling with harvey nichols security man pech early in 2005 .
after three weeks clare ended the relationship but pech bombarded her with 30 text messages a day and watched her constantly at work .
he followed her home to dulwich , south-east london but when she told him to leave her alone or she would report him , he said : " if you report me i 'll kill you . "
the police arrested him for harassment and later charged him after he broke the bail condition that he should not go near clare .
pech harassment 28 feb : relationship ends 5 apr : formal police complaint made 6 : apr : arrested and bailed 10 apr : rearrested after approaching clare 11 apr : denies harassment and held in custody 19 apr : granted conditional bail 31 aug : admits harassment and is bailed 13 sep : kills clare then himself after pleading guilty to harassment , he was granted bail by the court .
but six months after threatening to kill clare the czech-born former soldier carried out his threat , before shooting himself dead .
mrs bernal , 50 , from tunbridge wells , feels her daughter was let down by a legal system that failed to recognise the danger signs in pech 's obsessive behaviour .
the metropolitan police say pech broke his bail conditions once but mrs bernal disputes this , saying it happened three times .
she now sees it as her duty to protect future victims of stalking and harassment .
her campaign to raise awareness of the danger posed by stalkers is being supported by national domestic violence charity refuge and her mp greg clark .
" refuge would like to see mandatory and comprehensive training in how to identify the risks in domestic violence and stalking cases , " said chief executive sandra horley .
clare and her brothers philip , now 17 , and james , 21 , were brought up in tunbridge wells .
mrs bernal and their father , martin , divorced when they were children .
her mother said there was nothing in the family 's experience that could have prepared clare to see the " evil " in pech .
" clare saw nothing bad in anyone , " said ms bernal .
" that is the way we brought her up . "
' extremely concerned ' mrs bernal said she had nothing but admiration for harvey nichols security bosses , who initially moved pech to a different department , then suspended him and brought in the police .
" clare and i were both extremely concerned by what was going on .
clare was terribly , terribly upset , " said her mother .
mrs bernal claims that an inexperienced young woman police officer was sent to interview clare .
she also said that a file compiled by harvey nichols about pech 's irrational behaviour was not taken into account until just before the august court case .
clare and her best friend nicola bates , shortly before clare died " i am not blaming the young police officer one little bit - i am not just blaming the police , but the whole system across the board , " she said .
everyone was lulled into a false sense of security because nothing was heard of pech between april , when he was bailed by magistrates and august , when he appeared in court again .
in the summer , mother and daughter went on holiday to florence together .
" clare was getting stronger - we thought everything that could be done to protect clare was being done , " said ms bernal .
the inquest into his death was told pech had been to slovakia , where he bought and registered a handgun .
he was free to leave the country and bring back a gun - to me , that is madness patricia bernal , clare 's mother " we think he was there for most of those four months , " said ms bernal .
" that is why nothing was heard from him .
" he had been in the army and he retrained in firearms , bought a gun on the open market and brought it back into this country days before the shooting .
" then he carried out his threat .
he said to clare he was going to kill her .
he set it up and he planned it . "
ms bernal believes if he had not been allowed out on bail , her daughter would still be alive .
" he was free to leave the country and bring back a gun - to me , that is madness .
why did he not at least have to report to police once a week ? " she said .
" we are both in the eu - why was there no communication between the police forces ? "
' close monitoring ' a spokesman for her majesty 's courts service said he was unable to comment on a judicial decision taken by an individual court .
the metropolitan police said it could not have predicted from the nature of pech 's harassment of clare that he would murder her .
" pech was immediately rearrested when he approached clare near to her home address on 10 april , " it said in a statement .
" this shows we were closely monitoring the situation and responding swiftly to her appeals for police assistance . "
coroner dr paul knapman is due to resume the inquest into clare 's death on 8 may , when he is to report on his inquires into the alleged failures that allowed pech to kill .
tunbridge wells mp greg clark said : " the important thing at this stage is that the inquest is a full one that gets the chance to look at the failings that led to this murder .
" but if necessary i will be pressing for a full inquiry . "

clare bernal , 22 , was at work in the perfumery department of the store in knightsbridge last september , where her ex-boyfriend shot her dead .
michael pech had pleaded guilty to harassment but was awaiting sentence .
" the danger signs were there but they were not taken seriously enough , " said clare 's mother patricia , from kent .
clare had a brief fling with harvey nichols security man pech early in 2005 .
after three weeks clare ended the relationship but pech bombarded her with 30 text messages a day and watched her constantly at work .
he followed her home to dulwich , south-east london but when she told him to leave her alone or she would report him , he said : " if you report me i 'll kill you . "
the police arrested him for harassment and later charged him after he broke the bail condition that he should not go near clare .
pech harassment 28 feb : relationship ends 5 apr : formal police complaint made 6 : apr : arrested and bailed 10 apr : rearrested after approaching clare 11 apr : denies harassment and held in custody 19 apr : granted conditional bail 31 aug : admits harassment and is bailed 13 sep : kills clare then himself after pleading guilty to harassment , he was granted bail by the court .
but six months after threatening to kill clare the czech-born former soldier carried out his threat , before shooting himself dead .
mrs bernal , 50 , from tunbridge wells , feels her daughter was let down by a legal system that failed to recognise the danger signs in pech 's obsessive behaviour .
the metropolitan police say pech broke his bail conditions once but mrs bernal disputes this , saying it happened three times .
she now sees it as her duty to protect future victims of stalking and harassment .
her campaign to raise awareness of the danger posed by stalkers is being supported by national domestic violence charity refuge and her mp greg clark .
" refuge would like to see mandatory and comprehensive training in how to identify the risks in domestic violence and stalking cases , " said chief executive sandra horley .
clare and her brothers philip , now 17 , and james , 21 , were brought up in tunbridge wells .
mrs bernal and their father , martin , divorced when they were children .
her mother said there was nothing in the family 's experience that could have prepared clare to see the " evil " in pech .
" clare saw nothing bad in anyone , " said ms bernal .
" that is the way we brought her up . "
' extremely concerned ' mrs bernal said she had nothing but admiration for harvey nichols security bosses , who initially moved pech to a different department , then suspended him and brought in the police .
" clare and i were both extremely concerned by what was going on .
clare was terribly , terribly upset , " said her mother .
mrs bernal claims that an inexperienced young woman police officer was sent to interview clare .
she also said that a file compiled by harvey nichols about pech 's irrational behaviour was not taken into account until just before the august court case .
clare and her best friend nicola bates , shortly before clare died " i am not blaming the young police officer one little bit - i am not just blaming the police , but the whole system across the board , " she said .
everyone was lulled into a false sense of security because nothing was heard of pech between april , when he was bailed by magistrates and august , when he appeared in court again .
in the summer , mother and daughter went on holiday to florence together .
" clare was getting stronger - we thought everything that could be done to protect clare was being done , " said ms bernal .
the inquest into his death was told pech had been to slovakia , where he bought and registered a handgun .
he was free to leave the country and bring back a gun - to me , that is madness patricia bernal , clare 's mother " we think he was there for most of those four months , " said ms bernal .
" that is why nothing was heard from him .
" he had been in the army and he retrained in firearms , bought a gun on the open market and brought it back into this country days before the shooting .
" then he carried out his threat .
he said to clare he was going to kill her .
he set it up and he planned it . "
ms bernal believes if he had not been allowed out on bail , her daughter would still be alive .
" he was free to leave the country and bring back a gun - to me , that is madness .
why did he not at least have to report to police once a week ? " she said .
" we are both in the eu - why was there no communication between the police forces ? "
' close monitoring ' a spokesman for her majesty 's courts service said he was unable to comment on a judicial decision taken by an individual court .
the metropolitan police said it could not have predicted from the nature of pech 's harassment of clare that he would murder her .
" pech was immediately rearrested when he approached clare near to her home address on 10 april , " it said in a statement .
" this shows we were closely monitoring the situation and responding swiftly to her appeals for police assistance . "
coroner dr paul knapman is due to resume the inquest into clare 's death on 8 may , when he is to report on his inquires into the alleged failures that allowed pech to kill .
tunbridge wells mp greg clark said : " the important thing at this stage is that the inquest is a full one that gets the chance to look at the failings that led to this murder .
" but if necessary i will be pressing for a full inquiry . "

clare bernal , 22 , was at work in the perfumery department of the store in knightsbridge last september , where her ex-boyfriend shot her dead .
michael pech had pleaded guilty to harassment but was awaiting sentence .
" the danger signs were there but they were not taken seriously enough , " said clare 's mother patricia , from kent .
clare had a brief fling with harvey nichols security man pech early in 2005 .
after three weeks clare ended the relationship but pech bombarded her with 30 text messages a day and watched her constantly at work .
he followed her home to dulwich , south-east london but when she told him to leave her alone or she would report him , he said : " if you report me i 'll kill you . "
the police arrested him for harassment and later charged him after he broke the bail condition that he should not go near clare .
pech harassment 28 feb : relationship ends 5 apr : formal police complaint made 6 : apr : arrested and bailed 10 apr : rearrested after approaching clare 11 apr : denies harassment and held in custody 19 apr : granted conditional bail 31 aug : admits harassment and is bailed 13 sep : kills clare then himself after pleading guilty to harassment , he was granted bail by the court .
but six months after threatening to kill clare the czech-born former soldier carried out his threat , before shooting himself dead .
mrs bernal , 50 , from tunbridge wells , feels her daughter was let down by a legal system that failed to recognise the danger signs in pech 's obsessive behaviour .
the metropolitan police say pech broke his bail conditions once but mrs bernal disputes this , saying it happened three times .
she now sees it as her duty to protect future victims of stalking and harassment .
her campaign to raise awareness of the danger posed by stalkers is being supported by national domestic violence charity refuge and her mp greg clark .
" refuge would like to see mandatory and comprehensive training in how to identify the risks in domestic violence and stalking cases , " said chief executive sandra horley .
clare and her brothers philip , now 17 , and james , 21 , were brought up in tunbridge wells .
mrs bernal and their father , martin , divorced when they were children .
her mother said there was nothing in the family 's experience that could have prepared clare to see the " evil " in pech .
" clare saw nothing bad in anyone , " said ms bernal .
" that is the way we brought her up . "
' extremely concerned ' mrs bernal said she had nothing but admiration for harvey nichols security bosses , who initially moved pech to a different department , then suspended him and brought in the police .
" clare and i were both extremely concerned by what was going on .
clare was terribly , terribly upset , " said her mother .
mrs bernal claims that an inexperienced young woman police officer was sent to interview clare .
she also said that a file compiled by harvey nichols about pech 's irrational behaviour was not taken into account until just before the august court case .
clare and her best friend nicola bates , shortly before clare died " i am not blaming the young police officer one little bit - i am not just blaming the police , but the whole system across the board , " she said .
everyone was lulled into a false sense of security because nothing was heard of pech between april , when he was bailed by magistrates and august , when he appeared in court again .
in the summer , mother and daughter went on holiday to florence together .
" clare was getting stronger - we thought everything that could be done to protect clare was being done , " said ms bernal .

after three weeks clare ended the relationship but pech bombarded her with 30 text messages a day and watched her constantly at work .
he followed her home to dulwich , south-east london but when she told him to leave her alone or she would report him , he said : " if you report me i 'll kill you . "

alf thomas , expedition secretary of the cardiff-based society , said they wanted some more " groundbreaking " and " adventurous " applications .
the organisation , founded in 1982 , makes an annual award of £ 2,000 open to adventurers across the world .
previous recipients include a solo transatlantic rower and a potholer who explored deep caves in china .
the captain scott society recently doubled the size of its main award , but has received only five applications so far this year .
the deadline for submissions is the end of march . "
we ca n't get a second captain scott every year , but we like them to be original and ... epitomise the spirit of adventure shown by scott and his colleagues " alf thomas mr thomas told the bbc news website : " last year we had a great one - his name is oliver hicks .
he rowed single-handed from new jersey to falmouth across the atlantic .
" that was brilliant - it epitomised spirit of adventure we like .
to do it after 128 days at sea was an incredible feat . "
the expedition secretary said the society wanted to see more applications in that spirit .
" we ca n't get a second captain scott every year , but we like them to be original and we would like it to epitomise the spirit of adventure shown by captain scott and his colleagues , " he said .
the society , which offers a second award for young people up to 19 years of age , also likes to see an " element of risk " in the proposed expeditions .
mr thomas said : " it can be crossing the ice cap in greenland , or going to the north or south pole .
it can be canoeing - that 's a pretty adventurous pastime if they are going to do it in unexplored places . "
' more challenging ' the captain scott society was formed in 1982 to maintain the explorer 's spirit of adventure and his association with the city of cardiff .
the annual dinner commemorates the dinner hosted by the cardiff business community in 1910 for the officers and scientists of scott 's last expedition .
but mountain guide and former royal marine dave pearce - who recently helped recreate scott 's antarctic journey for the bbc - said it became harder each year for people to think up original adventures .
" i think it 's more challenging these days to find something more original .
i suppose it 's in the style of how you do it as well , " he said .
" the originality is going out of it because there are lots more people doing it .
ultimately , the world is a much smaller place now . "
modern equipment and satellites also made expeditions easier , he added .
mr pearce said of his own adventure replicating the conditions of scott 's race to the south pole : " i take my hat off the people like scott and -lsb- fellow polar explorer -rsb- amundsen , or -lsb- everest mountaineers -rsb- mallory and irving .
" we only experienced a small part of what they went through and it was very hard .
they were the real adventurers . "
the bbc 's the great race , recreating the antarctic race between captain scott and roald amundsen , will be screened later this year .

more than 90 % of the 88 market watchers polled by reuters said the bank of japan -lrb- boj -rrb- would act by 28 april .
they expect the boj to cut the amount of money pumped into the banking system and then start raising interest rates , currently at 0 % , later in the year .
the boj has used its monetary policy to help lift growth in japan 's economy .
contradiction falling prices , known as deflation , have hit corporate profits and salaries and plunged the japanese economy into a six year slump .
the bank of japan has followed its " quantitative easing " policy for the past five years - keeping the cost of borrowing low by holding interest rates at zero and making it easier for banks to lend money by pumping extra cash into the banking system .
it has said it would maintain this policy until year-on-year consumer prices stabilise at zero or higher .
japan 's nationwide consumer price index rose 0.1 % year-on-year in november and december , the first consecutive rise for almost eight years .
january 's figures are due out later this week and are expected to show a rise of 0.4 % .
most of the analysts and traders surveyed by reuters thought the bank of japan would begin changing its policy at its 28 april policy meeting .
further evidence of an impending change came last sunday when economy minister kaoru yosano said that japan had beaten deflation .
however , prime minister junichiro koizumi contradicted him on monday by refusing to accept that deflation was over .

soldiers , police officers and left-wing legislators were among those charged .
the country remains under a state of emergency , which was declared by president arroyo on friday after the army said it had foiled a coup plot .
schools in the capital manila stayed closed on monday , and the situation remained volatile .
a government spokesman said three of the 16 suspects had already been arrested .
four leftist members of the house of representatives were listed as suspects , as well as former senator gregorio honasan , who has been linked to several previous coup attempts .
legal challenge the crisis began on friday when the military announced it had uncovered a plan by senior officers to overthrow president arroyo .
mrs arroyo then declared a state of emergency , and a senior general , brig gen danilo lim , was detained on charges of planning the attempted coup .
a state of emergency bans rallies , but filipinos took to the streets in defiance of the ban on friday and saturday , to mark the 20th anniversary of a popular revolt that ousted ferdinand marcos as president .
then on sunday , the man who commands the philippines marines , maj gen renato miranda , was removed from his post , prompting a brief stand-off between his supporters and those of the president .
according to the bbc 's correspondent in manila , sarah toms , sunday 's friction was a sign that the threat is still not over to mrs arroyo , who survived an impeachment attempt last year over allegations of election rigging and corruption .
two groups of lawyers and civilians went to the supreme court on monday to challenge the state of emergency .
critics say the order reminds them of the use of martial law by ferdinand marcos .

kent police said a " number " of search warrants had been executed as they tried to capture the gang who stole up to £ 50m from a securitas depot .
police were searching a house near tunbridge wells which was raided by armed officers on saturday night .
unconfirmed reports say they also shot at a car in tankerton , near whitstable .
forensic officers were seen carrying several large brown bags from the raided house , but police have not confirmed whether the raid , or the incident in tankerton , were connected to the robbery .
final count forensic teams have completed their examination of the cash depot .
securitas has started its final count of how much cash is missing though the total is unlikely to be known until tuesday .
a 49-year-old man arrested in the raids on sunday was later released on bail .
his arrest was in connection with the discovery of a transit van containing £ 1.3m , along with guns , balaclavas and body armour in a car park of the ashford international hotel .
two men aged 55 and 33 arrested on saturday in the maidstone area have also been bailed .
police have confirmed a total of six arrests in the inquiry so far , all of whom have been released .
the guns were found alongside bundles of money in the transit van officers leading the investigation said on sunday the robbers were making mistakes because they were under pressure .
police said 14 cages - believed to have been used to transport the cash - were found at detling , near maidstone .
they believe the cages had been dumped from the back of a white box van at 0930 gmt on wednesday , just hours after the raid .
kent assistant chief constable adrian leppard said it may be the same renault vehicle that the gang used to move the cash from the depot .
crucially , the van has not been located .
he said police were very pleased with how the investigation was progressing .
he added that police had now received more than 1,000 calls but urged the public to continue contacting them with information about the robbery .
the depot manager , colin dixon , and his family are being kept in a safe house without contact even with their own relatives .
mr dixon was abducted after being pulled over in his car by what he thought was an unmarked police vehicle .
the gang also kidnapped his wife lynn and their nine-year-old son from their home in herne bay .
the family was then taken to the vale road depot where the manager was forced to let one of the gang in .

police were searching a house near tunbridge wells which was raided by armed officers on saturday night .

securitas has started its final count of how much cash is missing though the total is unlikely to be known until tuesday .
a 49-year-old man arrested in the raids on sunday was later released on bail .

they believe the cages had been dumped from the back of a white box van at 0930 gmt on wednesday , just hours after the raid .

his arrest was in connection with the discovery of a transit van containing £ 1.3m , along with guns , balaclavas and body armour in a car park of the ashford international hotel .
two men aged 55 and 33 arrested on saturday in the maidstone area have also been bailed .
police have confirmed a total of six arrests in the inquiry so far , all of whom have been released .
the guns were found alongside bundles of money in the transit van officers leading the investigation said on sunday the robbers were making mistakes because they were under pressure .
police said 14 cages - believed to have been used to transport the cash - were found at detling , near maidstone .
they believe the cages had been dumped from the back of a white box van at 0930 gmt on wednesday , just hours after the raid .
kent assistant chief constable adrian leppard said it may be the same renault vehicle that the gang used to move the cash from the depot .
crucially , the van has not been located .
he said police were very pleased with how the investigation was progressing .
he added that police had now received more than 1,000 calls but urged the public to continue contacting them with information about the robbery .
the depot manager , colin dixon , and his family are being kept in a safe house without contact even with their own relatives .
mr dixon was abducted after being pulled over in his car by what he thought was an unmarked police vehicle .
the gang also kidnapped his wife lynn and their nine-year-old son from their home in herne bay .
the family was then taken to the vale road depot where the manager was forced to let one of the gang in .

watchdog group passenger focus said only 54 % of travellers with wales ' main train operator arriva are satisfied about their personal safety at stations , against 59 % across the uk .
arriva said it invested heavily in security and had urged staff to report potential problems straight away .
the firm also said abuse and violence were problems throughout the industry .

similarly the glacial pace of browsing the web on a current generation handset stands in stark contrast to the ever faster speeds most enjoy in the home and office .
every mobile operator acknowledges that upping the speed of mobile data is hugely important and several technologies are coming that could mean the end of those frustrations .
what mobile operators are aiming for is to get response times from the network below 100 milliseconds .
this is the point at which humans stop noticing a delay .
achieving such response times is tricky on the second generation -lrb- 2g -rrb- networks most people use today .
this is true even when the data handling abilities of these networks are improved using technologies such as the general packet radio service -lrb- gprs -rrb- and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution -lrb- edge -rrb- technology .
gprs has been in use on many mobile networks for years but edge as a technology is only seriously starting to be introduced now , in both networks and handsets .
the next generation despite the improvements to the second generation networks , all operators agree that newer third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- networks will do a far better job of shuffling data around and hitting the critical response times .
it is widely accepted , though , that the basic 3g technology itself will need a boost if it is to match the expected data demands of future customers .
this is partly because the basic data rate available with 3g technology , 384 kilobits per second -lrb- kbps -rrb- , is not that much higher than can be achieved with edge technology , which maxes out at just under 300kbps .
mark smith , a spokesman for the gsm association , said operators were happy about upgrading and recognised the need even though many had spent billions buying licences and building their 3g networks .
the technology likely to provide the bandwidth upgrade goes by the catchy name of high-speed downlink packet access .
" the hsdpa upgrade is not a switch out of old technology , " said mr smith .
" it 's just an upgrade that allows much greater bandwidth . "
" it 's really no different to how they rolled out gprs , " he said .
once in place , hsdpa networks offer speeds up to 1.5 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- while on the move and future versions much more than that .
mr smith said the first hsdpa networks are starting to appear and the first complete hsdpa network was likely to be in the us .
handsets that can take advantage of hsdpa speeds are also now making an appearance .
wireless methods the data handling abilities of 3g phone networks do not stop improving with hsdpa , however .
on the horizon is a technology called 3g-lte -lrb- long term evolution -rrb- which could give bandwidths of up to 100mbps .
mark heath , research director at sound partners , and author of a report into 3g futures , said such a technology might be needed if mobile tv took off and operators had to ship shows to lots of people at the same time .
operators are more likely to plump for network hardware upgrades because they can exert control over them , rather than go wholeheartedly for rival technologies such as wi-fi or wimax .
angelo lamme , spokesman for hardware firm symbol , said that wi-fi was complementary to mobile networks as it was a hotspot technology and was not going to be a serious rival for such systems .
while wimax could be more of a threat because it offers high bandwidth over large areas , he said a lot of work had yet to be done on roaming standards between wimax zones or from mobile networks to wimax zones and back again .
" wimax has been seriously overhyped , " said mr lamme .
the future then does seem to lie with the mobile technologies but users face frustration as the upgrades , like those games and ringtones , take time to arrive .

similarly the glacial pace of browsing the web on a current generation handset stands in stark contrast to the ever faster speeds most enjoy in the home and office .
every mobile operator acknowledges that upping the speed of mobile data is hugely important and several technologies are coming that could mean the end of those frustrations .
what mobile operators are aiming for is to get response times from the network below 100 milliseconds .
this is the point at which humans stop noticing a delay .
achieving such response times is tricky on the second generation -lrb- 2g -rrb- networks most people use today .
this is true even when the data handling abilities of these networks are improved using technologies such as the general packet radio service -lrb- gprs -rrb- and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution -lrb- edge -rrb- technology .
gprs has been in use on many mobile networks for years but edge as a technology is only seriously starting to be introduced now , in both networks and handsets .
the next generation despite the improvements to the second generation networks , all operators agree that newer third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- networks will do a far better job of shuffling data around and hitting the critical response times .
it is widely accepted , though , that the basic 3g technology itself will need a boost if it is to match the expected data demands of future customers .
this is partly because the basic data rate available with 3g technology , 384 kilobits per second -lrb- kbps -rrb- , is not that much higher than can be achieved with edge technology , which maxes out at just under 300kbps .
upgrades to mobile phone technology could take some time mark smith , a spokesman for the gsm association , said operators were happy about upgrading and recognised the need even though many had spent billions buying licences and building their 3g networks .
the technology likely to provide the bandwidth upgrade goes by the catchy name of high-speed downlink packet access .
" the hsdpa upgrade is not a switch out of old technology , " said mr smith .
" it 's just an upgrade that allows much greater bandwidth . "
" it 's really no different to how they rolled out gprs , " he said .
once in place , hsdpa networks offer speeds up to 1.5 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- while on the move and future versions much more than that .
mr smith said the first hsdpa networks are starting to appear and the first complete hsdpa network was likely to be in the us .
handsets that can take advantage of hsdpa speeds are also now making an appearance .
wireless methods the data handling abilities of 3g phone networks do not stop improving with hsdpa , however .
on the horizon is a technology called 3g-lte -lrb- long term evolution -rrb- which could give bandwidths of up to 100mbps .
mark heath , research director at sound partners , and author of a report into 3g futures , said such a technology might be needed if mobile tv took off and operators had to ship shows to lots of people at the same time .
operators are more likely to plump for network hardware upgrades because they can exert control over them , rather than go wholeheartedly for rival technologies such as wi-fi or wimax .
angelo lamme , spokesman for hardware firm symbol , said that wi-fi was complementary to mobile networks as it was a hotspot technology and was not going to be a serious rival for such systems .
while wimax could be more of a threat because it offers high bandwidth over large areas , he said a lot of work had yet to be done on roaming standards between wimax zones or from mobile networks to wimax zones and back again .
" wimax has been seriously overhyped , " said mr lamme .
the future then does seem to lie with the mobile technologies but users face frustration as the upgrades , like those games and ringtones , take time to arrive .

similarly the glacial pace of browsing the web on a current generation handset stands in stark contrast to the ever faster speeds most enjoy in the home and office .
every mobile operator acknowledges that upping the speed of mobile data is hugely important and several technologies are coming that could mean the end of those frustrations .
what mobile operators are aiming for is to get response times from the network below 100 milliseconds .
this is the point at which humans stop noticing a delay .
achieving such response times is tricky on the second generation -lrb- 2g -rrb- networks most people use today .
this is true even when the data handling abilities of these networks are improved using technologies such as the general packet radio service -lrb- gprs -rrb- and enhanced data rates for gsm evolution -lrb- edge -rrb- technology .
gprs has been in use on many mobile networks for years but edge as a technology is only seriously starting to be introduced now , in both networks and handsets .
the next generation despite the improvements to the second generation networks , all operators agree that newer third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- networks will do a far better job of shuffling data around and hitting the critical response times .
it is widely accepted , though , that the basic 3g technology itself will need a boost if it is to match the expected data demands of future customers .
this is partly because the basic data rate available with 3g technology , 384 kilobits per second -lrb- kbps -rrb- , is not that much higher than can be achieved with edge technology , which maxes out at just under 300kbps .
upgrades to mobile phone technology could take some time mark smith , a spokesman for the gsm association , said operators were happy about upgrading and recognised the need even though many had spent billions buying licences and building their 3g networks .
the technology likely to provide the bandwidth upgrade goes by the catchy name of high-speed downlink packet access .
" the hsdpa upgrade is not a switch out of old technology , " said mr smith .
" it 's just an upgrade that allows much greater bandwidth . "
" it 's really no different to how they rolled out gprs , " he said .
once in place , hsdpa networks offer speeds up to 1.5 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- while on the move and future versions much more than that .
mr smith said the first hsdpa networks are starting to appear and the first complete hsdpa network was likely to be in the us .
handsets that can take advantage of hsdpa speeds are also now making an appearance .
wireless methods the data handling abilities of 3g phone networks do not stop improving with hsdpa , however .
on the horizon is a technology called 3g-lte -lrb- long term evolution -rrb- which could give bandwidths of up to 100mbps .
mark heath , research director at sound partners , and author of a report into 3g futures , said such a technology might be needed if mobile tv took off and operators had to ship shows to lots of people at the same time .
operators are more likely to plump for network hardware upgrades because they can exert control over them , rather than go wholeheartedly for rival technologies such as wi-fi or wimax .
angelo lamme , spokesman for hardware firm symbol , said that wi-fi was complementary to mobile networks as it was a hotspot technology and was not going to be a serious rival for such systems .
while wimax could be more of a threat because it offers high bandwidth over large areas , he said a lot of work had yet to be done on roaming standards between wimax zones or from mobile networks to wimax zones and back again .
" wimax has been seriously overhyped , " said mr lamme .
the future then does seem to lie with the mobile technologies but users face frustration as the upgrades , like those games and ringtones , take time to arrive .

the bbc news website 's justin pearce spoke to one young couple who are delighted at the news .
mpumi mathabela and asanda mjobo are the kind of couple who finish each other 's sentences even when they 're disagreeing with each other .
" i 'd like to be pregnant ... " says asanda . " ... and i 'm like : ' yippee ' . "
mpumi chimes in .
" but when we 're older , " asanda says .
" you ca n't have a baby in a flat . "
" when we have a secure future , " agrees mpumi .
" i would n't want a child to be asking for something when i could n't buy it .
so as soon as we 've sorted that out - we 'll have one . "
gay and lesbian couples are allowed to adopt in south africa , but asanda and mpumi will instead be looking for a donor father .
asanda gets a wistful look in her eye : " such an experience , that cute little thing growing inside you . "
mpumi shudders : " i 'm scared of having a child inside me .
i 'm glad she made that decision . "
if god intended you to be lesbians , then who am i to judge ?
asanda 's grandmother they have been living together for almost two years and have always thought they would get married one day .
" even if the court ruling had been different we would still have gone ahead with it , " mpumi says .
" not necessarily in a year , but as soon as we 're ready .
maybe in two years , maybe less . "
asanda works as an office administrator - mpumi produces the website for behind the mask , a group that works for the rights of gays and lesbians in africa .
families in contrast to many other lesbian and gay couples in south africa , asanda and mpumi have enjoyed the support of their own families in their relationship .
mpumi works on gay and lesbian rights issues throughout africa " my mother calls asanda ' mrs mathabela ' , " says mpumi - she in turn said she was treated like one of the family when she visited asanda 's parents ' home in the eastern cape .
" my family - they love me , " asanda says .
" my gran said when i told her : " if god intended you to be lesbians , then who am i to judge ? "
they know i 'm living a clean life , not doing any drugs and working hard . "
mpumi had a similar experience : " my mum and dad are very open minded .
mum always said : ' stand up for what you believe in ' . "
discrimination despite laws that are favourable towards lesbians and gay men in south africa , discrimination remains common in wider society , and black lesbians endure the worst of the abuse .
they always say we contribute to moral degeneration - they blame that on us , as if the whole beautiful thing of marriage and family values is going to disappear mpumi earlier in february , a young woman called zoliswa nkonyana was murdered by a group of 20 men in khayelitsha , cape town , for being a lesbian .
asanda and mpumi recognise that they are luckier than most , and say they would not always advise another lesbian to be as open as they are about their sexuality .
" she must be sure she wants to come out , " asanda says .
" it 's not always safe to be an out lesbian . "
" you need introspection , " mpumi says .
" you need to face your fears . "
harassment mpumi recalls harassment when she was a student in durban : " guys at the technikon always said we take their women - like all these women who they do n't know belonged to them , or women are some kind of prize . "
asanda tells of the time when she , her former partner and some female friends were out at a cafe one night - a group of men kept calling to them , followed them out when they left , and beat up some of their friends .
the couple enjoy the support of their families " they were jealous because we were with beautiful girls who did n't give them any attention .
we do n't do public places a lot - we prefer to chill at a friend 's house or go to safer places and get a cab home . "
in their neighbourhood , people either accept or ignore them .
" one time the painter who was painting the flats came in while i was watching tv , " says mpumi .
" he asked if i had a boyfriend , and i said : ' no , a girlfriend ' .
" he looked at me - there was that blank look for a second , and then it was : ' i did n't hear you say a word ' . "
love " this gay marriage is something they do n't want to hear about , " says asanda .
" as if all heterosexual marriages are working ok , and as if when they legalise gay marriage everyone will become gay . "
" they always say we contribute to moral degeneration , " mpumi adds .
" they blame it on us - as if the whole beautiful thing of marriage and family values is going to disappear .
but family values have already disappeared and we have nothing to do with it .
i want to ask one of them what 's so perfect about their hetero world the way it is now ? "
" fathers are raping children , " asanda says .
" brothers rape sisters . "
" and we just love one another , but it 's a problem for them . "

the move to abandon the national unification council and its guidelines will infuriate china , analysts say .
china believes mr chen is pushing for taiwan 's formal independence , which china pledges to use force resisting .
china earlier warned mr chen that shutting the council would " trigger a serious crisis " .
mr chen announced the closure after a meeting of taiwan 's national security council .
" the national unification council will cease functioning and the budget no longer be appropriated , " he told reporters .
mr chen said the decision to close the council was due to china 's " military threat " .
taiwan complains that china has been building up its military offensive capability across the taiwan strait , and has at least 700 ballistic missiles targeting the island .
' absurd ' china and taiwan have been governed separately since a civil war ended in 1949 , but china still sees taiwan as its territory and has threatened to use force if the island moves towards declaring independence .
taiwan flashpoint the us , taiwan 's closest ally in the face of this threat , has made clear that it supports the status quo , and did not want the council to be scrapped .
mr chen 's wish to get rid of the council and its guidelines has long been known , despite his pledge upon taking office in 2000 that he would not scrap it or its guidelines .
last week he reaffirmed this view when he told visiting us congressman robert simmons that the national unification council and its national unification guidelines were " absurd products of an absurd era " .
" it deprives the taiwan people 's rights to freely decide on cross-strait relations and the future direction of our country , " he said .
but beijing has expressed strong opposition .
" the escalated secessionist push of chen shui-bian will certainly trigger a serious crisis across the taiwan straits and destroy peace and stability in the asia pacific region , " the mainland 's taiwan affairs office said in an online statement late on sunday .
" chen shui-bian is a troublemaker for taiwan , for cross-strait relations and for the asia pacific region , " it added .
the national unification council was set up in 1990 as an attempt to convince the chinese authorities that taiwan was committed to reunification , and it helped kick-start landmark talks between the two sides in the early 1990s .
what do you think of president chen shui-bian 's decision to scrap the national unification council .
do you think taiwan should push for formal independence from china ?
your comments : i think president chen shui-bian 's decision to scrap the national unification council is because of china always refuses to talk to taiwan 's authorities and has been threaten to use force .
although , i agree with president chen 's decision to scrap the national unification council , bi still disagree with taiwan push for formal independence from china .
gloria chiu , taipei , taiwan to scrap the council does nothing good for teople in taiwan but causing the tension in and out of the island .
chen knows taiwan independence is just a dream .
without a close connection with mainland china , taiwan will suffer very soon .
chin-wen leu , taipei , taiwan , republic of china i think taiwan has every right to push for formal independence .
taiwan has as much right to be free from chinese media and internet censorship as well as terrible human rights abuses as the next country .
the international community needs to back taiwan up urgently .
zachary barker , bristol we taiwanese are all fully support to president chen 's decision .
taiwan is taiwan , china is china , they are two independent countries since world war two .
the per capita gnp of taiwan is over 16,000 usd , and china is only around 1,200 usd , there is no reason to force taiwan be unified by china !

thousands died in the 1992-1995 conflict in bosnia the hearings are the culmination of 13 years of legal wrangling , claims and counter-claims .
it is the first case before the icj to involve the charge of genocide against a sovereign state .
when bosnia took what was then yugoslavia before the icj in march 1993 , the war in bosnia was still raging with no end in sight .
sarajevo 's intention in going to the united nations court , which deals with disputes between states , was two-fold .
first , bosnia wanted the icj - also known as the world court - to declare that yugoslavia was involved , through its agents and surrogates , in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in bosnia , and to order belgrade to stop that practice immediately .
second , bosnia asked for the payment by yugoslavia of reparations for the killings , torture and material damage caused in the war .
within weeks the icj issued an interim judgement which ordered yugoslavia to do all within its power to prevent the commission of genocide in bosnia .
and it also called on the two sides not to take any action that might aggravate the confict .
marathon legal battle but the court 's ruling , like many un security council resolutions , was ignored ; and the fighting continued for another two and a half years .
in the meantime , the two sides entered an extraordinary legal duel .
bosnian muslims rallied in support of the start of the icj hearing initially , yugoslavia wanted to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the icj had no jurisdiction in the case .
but the court ruled in 1996 that the case could , indeed , go ahead .
but why has the case taken so long to come before the judges ?
edgar chen , an international law expert with the us-based coalition for international justice , says the icj 's procedures are complex and time-consuming .
" i think the average time for a case from the filing of an application to the judgement is about eight or so years , " he said .
a lot of the evidence so critical to proving genocide only emerged during the proceedings of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , he added .
counter-claim further delays in getting the case before the judges have been caused by prolonged legal wrangling .
in 1997 yugoslavia filed a counter-claim against bosnia , charging it with the commission of genocide against serbs in bosnia .
milosevic is being tried on charges of war crimes and genocide but four years later - following the fall of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic 's authoritarian regime - yugoslavia withdrew its counter-claim .
bosnia ignored suggestions from belgrade that it should settle out of court , and in 2003 the icj gave it the final go-ahead to present its case .
however , when the hearings open on monday , belgrade may launch yet another procedural challenge .
this is likely to be based on a judgement the icj handed down two years ago in a separate genocide case that yugoslavia had brought against eight nato countries in relation to the kosovo conflict .
the case was dismissed - partly on the grounds that at the time of the events in question yugoslavia was not fully recognised as a member of the un .
but perhaps yugoslavia 's successor , serbia and montenegro , can now use the same argument to dismiss this case ?
professor vojin dimitrijevic , director of the belgrade centre for human rights , says " this will certainly be the first procedural argument of the serb and montenegrin side " .
belgrade 's defence once the arguments on the merits of the case get under way , belgrade is likely to offer two lines of defence .
first , it is expected to argue that whatever the nature of the terrible crimes committed in bosnia , they did not amount to genocide in the internationally-accepted definition of the term under the 1948 geneva convention .
intent to commit genocide is hard to prove in court the convention defines genocide as " the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " .
such intent is difficult to prove .
indeed , the only two genocide convictions reached so far by the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia both relate to defendants who were not judged to have had such intent .
instead , general radislav krstic and colonel vidoje blagojevic were found guilty of complicity in genocide .
in other words , they were judged to have helped others who had a genocidal intent , to carry out the killing of nearly 8,000 muslims after the fall of srebrenica in july 1995 .
how the icj 's judges interpret the judgements of the war crimes tribunal just a few streets away in the hague remains to be seen .
they are under no obligation to use any such rulings as setting a precedent .
in any case , if they accept that genocide did take place in bosnia , belgrade is likely to come up with another argument , according to vojin dimitrijevic .
milosevic 's trial has seen video clips of bosnian muslims being shot " the second line of defence would be to prove that somebody committed these terrible crimes in bosnia but they had no support , no contact , no approval from belgrade . "
the bosnian side will almost certainly counter such claims by other evidence that has emerged from the war crimes tribunal 's caseload in relation to srebrenica .
in the trial of slobodan milosevic the prosecution has been seeking to prove a connection with belgrade by using as evidence a video film that shows a group of paramilitaries allegedly linked to serbia , known as the scorpions , killing six captured bosnian muslims .
other information that has emerged indicates that general ratko mladic - charged with being the chief culprit in the srebrenica massacre - was , like other bosnian serb officers , on the payroll of the yugoslav army .
delayed ruling however , bosnia may find it hard to obtain some of the documentary evidence to back this up , because it was released by belgrade to the war crimes tribunal on the understanding that it would not be made available to third parties .
the two sides will have just a few weeks - until early may - to set out their case .
thereafter the judges will retire to reach their verdict , which will take several months .
a ruling is likely to be delivered towards the end of the year or early next year .
if the icj rules in favour of bosnia , it could either order serbia and montenegro to pay compensation or to make a formal apology .
it could also require a combination of the two .
perhaps no other country will be following the proceedings with as much attention as croatia , which has submitted its own genocide case against serbia and montenegro .
unlike bosnia , which has not formally specified how much it will demand in reparations , croatia has attached the hefty price tag of $ 29bn to its claim .
bosnia , which suffered much more from war , may be seeking over three times as much .

thousands died in the 1992-1995 conflict in bosnia the hearings are the culmination of 13 years of legal wrangling , claims and counter-claims .
it is the first case before the icj to involve the charge of genocide against a sovereign state .
when bosnia took what was then yugoslavia before the icj in march 1993 , the war in bosnia was still raging with no end in sight .
sarajevo 's intention in going to the united nations court , which deals with disputes between states , was two-fold .
first , bosnia wanted the icj - also known as the world court - to declare that yugoslavia was involved , through its agents and surrogates , in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in bosnia , and to order belgrade to stop that practice immediately .
second , bosnia asked for the payment by yugoslavia of reparations for the killings , torture and material damage caused in the war .
within weeks the icj issued an interim judgement which ordered yugoslavia to do all within its power to prevent the commission of genocide in bosnia .
and it also called on the two sides not to take any action that might aggravate the confict .
marathon legal battle but the court 's ruling , like many un security council resolutions , was ignored ; and the fighting continued for another two and a half years .
in the meantime , the two sides entered an extraordinary legal duel .
bosnian muslims rallied in support of the start of the icj hearing initially , yugoslavia wanted to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the icj had no jurisdiction in the case .
but the court ruled in 1996 that the case could , indeed , go ahead .
but why has the case taken so long to come before the judges ?
edgar chen , an international law expert with the us-based coalition for international justice , says the icj 's procedures are complex and time-consuming .
" i think the average time for a case from the filing of an application to the judgement is about eight or so years , " he said .
a lot of the evidence so critical to proving genocide only emerged during the proceedings of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , he added .
counter-claim further delays in getting the case before the judges have been caused by prolonged legal wrangling .
in 1997 yugoslavia filed a counter-claim against bosnia , charging it with the commission of genocide against serbs in bosnia .
milosevic is being tried on charges of war crimes and genocide but four years later - following the fall of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic 's authoritarian regime - yugoslavia withdrew its counter-claim .
bosnia ignored suggestions from belgrade that it should settle out of court , and in 2003 the icj gave it the final go-ahead to present its case .
however , when the hearings open on monday , belgrade may launch yet another procedural challenge .
this is likely to be based on a judgement the icj handed down two years ago in a separate genocide case that yugoslavia had brought against eight nato countries in relation to the kosovo conflict .
the case was dismissed - partly on the grounds that at the time of the events in question yugoslavia was not fully recognised as a member of the un .
but perhaps yugoslavia 's successor , serbia and montenegro , can now use the same argument to dismiss this case ?
professor vojin dimitrijevic , director of the belgrade centre for human rights , says " this will certainly be the first procedural argument of the serb and montenegrin side " .
belgrade 's defence once the arguments on the merits of the case get under way , belgrade is likely to offer two lines of defence .
first , it is expected to argue that whatever the nature of the terrible crimes committed in bosnia , they did not amount to genocide in the internationally-accepted definition of the term under the 1948 geneva convention .
intent to commit genocide is hard to prove in court the convention defines genocide as " the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " .
such intent is difficult to prove .
indeed , the only two genocide convictions reached so far by the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia both relate to defendants who were not judged to have had such intent .
instead , general radislav krstic and colonel vidoje blagojevic were found guilty of complicity in genocide .
in other words , they were judged to have helped others who had a genocidal intent , to carry out the killing of nearly 8,000 muslims after the fall of srebrenica in july 1995 .
how the icj 's judges interpret the judgements of the war crimes tribunal just a few streets away in the hague remains to be seen .
they are under no obligation to use any such rulings as setting a precedent .
in any case , if they accept that genocide did take place in bosnia , belgrade is likely to come up with another argument , according to vojin dimitrijevic .
milosevic 's trial has seen video clips of bosnian muslims being shot " the second line of defence would be to prove that somebody committed these terrible crimes in bosnia but they had no support , no contact , no approval from belgrade . "
the bosnian side will almost certainly counter such claims by other evidence that has emerged from the war crimes tribunal 's caseload in relation to srebrenica .
in the trial of slobodan milosevic the prosecution has been seeking to prove a connection with belgrade by using as evidence a video film that shows a group of paramilitaries allegedly linked to serbia , known as the scorpions , killing six captured bosnian muslims .
other information that has emerged indicates that general ratko mladic - charged with being the chief culprit in the srebrenica massacre - was , like other bosnian serb officers , on the payroll of the yugoslav army .
delayed ruling however , bosnia may find it hard to obtain some of the documentary evidence to back this up , because it was released by belgrade to the war crimes tribunal on the understanding that it would not be made available to third parties .
the two sides will have just a few weeks - until early may - to set out their case .
thereafter the judges will retire to reach their verdict , which will take several months .
a ruling is likely to be delivered towards the end of the year or early next year .
if the icj rules in favour of bosnia , it could either order serbia and montenegro to pay compensation or to make a formal apology .
it could also require a combination of the two .
perhaps no other country will be following the proceedings with as much attention as croatia , which has submitted its own genocide case against serbia and montenegro .

other information that has emerged indicates that general ratko mladic - charged with being the chief culprit in the srebrenica massacre - was , like other bosnian serb officers , on the payroll of the yugoslav army .
delayed ruling however , bosnia may find it hard to obtain some of the documentary evidence to back this up , because it was released by belgrade to the war crimes tribunal on the understanding that it would not be made available to third parties .
the two sides will have just a few weeks - until early may - to set out their case .
thereafter the judges will retire to reach their verdict , which will take several months .
a ruling is likely to be delivered towards the end of the year or early next year .
if the icj rules in favour of bosnia , it could either order serbia and montenegro to pay compensation or to make a formal apology .
it could also require a combination of the two .
perhaps no other country will be following the proceedings with as much attention as croatia , which has submitted its own genocide case against serbia and montenegro .
unlike bosnia , which has not formally specified how much it will demand in reparations , croatia has attached the hefty price tag of $ 29bn to its claim .
bosnia , which suffered much more from war , may be seeking over three times as much .

thousands died in the 1992-1995 conflict in bosnia the hearings are the culmination of 13 years of legal wrangling , claims and counter-claims .
it is the first case before the icj to involve the charge of genocide against a sovereign state .
when bosnia took what was then yugoslavia before the icj in march 1993 , the war in bosnia was still raging with no end in sight .
sarajevo 's intention in going to the united nations court , which deals with disputes between states , was two-fold .
first , bosnia wanted the icj - also known as the world court - to declare that yugoslavia was involved , through its agents and surrogates , in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in bosnia , and to order belgrade to stop that practice immediately .
second , bosnia asked for the payment by yugoslavia of reparations for the killings , torture and material damage caused in the war .
within weeks the icj issued an interim judgement which ordered yugoslavia to do all within its power to prevent the commission of genocide in bosnia .
and it also called on the two sides not to take any action that might aggravate the confict .
marathon legal battle but the court 's ruling , like many un security council resolutions , was ignored ; and the fighting continued for another two and a half years .
in the meantime , the two sides entered an extraordinary legal duel .
bosnian muslims rallied in support of the start of the icj hearing initially , yugoslavia wanted to have the case dismissed on the grounds that the icj had no jurisdiction in the case .
but the court ruled in 1996 that the case could , indeed , go ahead .
but why has the case taken so long to come before the judges ?
edgar chen , an international law expert with the us-based coalition for international justice , says the icj 's procedures are complex and time-consuming .
" i think the average time for a case from the filing of an application to the judgement is about eight or so years , " he said .
a lot of the evidence so critical to proving genocide only emerged during the proceedings of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , he added .
counter-claim further delays in getting the case before the judges have been caused by prolonged legal wrangling .
in 1997 yugoslavia filed a counter-claim against bosnia , charging it with the commission of genocide against serbs in bosnia .
milosevic is being tried on charges of war crimes and genocide but four years later - following the fall of yugoslav president slobodan milosevic 's authoritarian regime - yugoslavia withdrew its counter-claim .
bosnia ignored suggestions from belgrade that it should settle out of court , and in 2003 the icj gave it the final go-ahead to present its case .
however , when the hearings open on monday , belgrade may launch yet another procedural challenge .
this is likely to be based on a judgement the icj handed down two years ago in a separate genocide case that yugoslavia had brought against eight nato countries in relation to the kosovo conflict .
the case was dismissed - partly on the grounds that at the time of the events in question yugoslavia was not fully recognised as a member of the un .
but perhaps yugoslavia 's successor , serbia and montenegro , can now use the same argument to dismiss this case ?
professor vojin dimitrijevic , director of the belgrade centre for human rights , says " this will certainly be the first procedural argument of the serb and montenegrin side " .
belgrade 's defence once the arguments on the merits of the case get under way , belgrade is likely to offer two lines of defence .
first , it is expected to argue that whatever the nature of the terrible crimes committed in bosnia , they did not amount to genocide in the internationally-accepted definition of the term under the 1948 geneva convention .
intent to commit genocide is hard to prove in court the convention defines genocide as " the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group " .
such intent is difficult to prove .
indeed , the only two genocide convictions reached so far by the war crimes tribunal for the former yugoslavia both relate to defendants who were not judged to have had such intent .
instead , general radislav krstic and colonel vidoje blagojevic were found guilty of complicity in genocide .
in other words , they were judged to have helped others who had a genocidal intent , to carry out the killing of nearly 8,000 muslims after the fall of srebrenica in july 1995 .
how the icj 's judges interpret the judgements of the war crimes tribunal just a few streets away in the hague remains to be seen .
they are under no obligation to use any such rulings as setting a precedent .
in any case , if they accept that genocide did take place in bosnia , belgrade is likely to come up with another argument , according to vojin dimitrijevic .
milosevic 's trial has seen video clips of bosnian muslims being shot " the second line of defence would be to prove that somebody committed these terrible crimes in bosnia but they had no support , no contact , no approval from belgrade . "
the bosnian side will almost certainly counter such claims by other evidence that has emerged from the war crimes tribunal 's caseload in relation to srebrenica .

in any case , if they accept that genocide did take place in bosnia , belgrade is likely to come up with another argument , according to vojin dimitrijevic .
" the second line of defence would be to prove that somebody committed these terrible crimes in bosnia but they had no support , no contact , no approval from belgrade . "
the bosnian side will almost certainly counter such claims by other evidence that has emerged from the war crimes tribunal 's caseload in relation to srebrenica .
in the trial of slobodan milosevic the prosecution has been seeking to prove a connection with belgrade by using as evidence a video film that shows a group of paramilitaries allegedly linked to serbia , known as the scorpions , killing six captured bosnian muslims .
other information that has emerged indicates that general ratko mladic - charged with being the chief culprit in the srebrenica massacre - was , like other bosnian serb officers , on the payroll of the yugoslav army .
delayed ruling however , bosnia may find it hard to obtain some of the documentary evidence to back this up , because it was released by belgrade to the war crimes tribunal on the understanding that it would not be made available to third parties .
the two sides will have just a few weeks - until early may - to set out their case .
thereafter the judges will retire to reach their verdict , which will take several months .
a ruling is likely to be delivered towards the end of the year or early next year .
if the icj rules in favour of bosnia , it could either order serbia and montenegro to pay compensation or to make a formal apology .
it could also require a combination of the two .
perhaps no other country will be following the proceedings with as much attention as croatia , which has submitted its own genocide case against serbia and montenegro .
unlike bosnia , which has not formally specified how much it will demand in reparations , croatia has attached the hefty price tag of $ 29bn to its claim .
bosnia , which suffered much more from war , may be seeking over three times as much .

the firm added that trading since the start of the year had been good , and it was anticipating a steady rise in house prices this year as demand picked up .
persimmon posted annual pre-tax profits of £ 495.4m -lrb- $ 866.2m -rrb- for 2005 , up by 5.9 % on the previous year .
the york-based firm said it had sold 12,636 homes last year , up 2 % on 2004 , at an average price of £ 180,892 .
i think we 'll see a steady increase in selling prices during the current year duncan davidson , persimmon chairman see persimmon 's share price " persimmon has seen really quite an improvement in the market since the new year , " chairman duncan davidson told the bbc .
" i think we 'll see a steady increase in selling prices during the current year because the demand is picking up . "
the slowdown in house price growth last year has hit profits at some of persimmon 's rivals .
last week george wimpey said underlying profits had fallen 16 % after it increased incentives to lift sales .
persimmon completed the acquisition of smaller rival westbury in january and said that the integration of the business was going well .
it said it had closed eight of westbury 's 10 offices which had led to about 500 people leaving the firm .
persimmon estimates the savings from integrating westbury will be £ 25m this year and about £ 40m from 2007 onwards .
