but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .
the pro-syria and hezbollah demonstrations may also threaten frank-walter steinmeier 's expected trip to damascus on monday . damascus visit could ease tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's syria could hold the key to peace in the region his last scheduled visit to the syrian capital in august was cancelled after syrian president bashar al-assad made statements condemning israel and offered praise to hezbollah for its war against the jewish state this summer . however , after stating friday that syria 's involvement was integral to regional peace efforts , steinmeier may use the opportunity to discuss assad 's influence in lebanon and attempt to diffuse the situation .

so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .
it re-emerged in july this year as the a350 xwb , which stands for extra wide body . financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and , tellingly , airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 13-billion -rrb- project would be paid for . eads and airbus , a 100-percent-owned unit of eads , are stretched for cash because of cost over-runs with the airbus a380 superjumbo project , which is running two years behind schedule . as a result , eads stressed on friday that the decision on the a350 was linked to the " full implementation " of a vast restructuring plan called power 8 , which aims to cut costs throughout the business . company cash not state funding for a350 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding for the a350 will come from a number of sources it said the a350 would be financed " predominantly from the company cash flows " and also from " risk sharing partners . "
nevertheless , eads and airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project . other sources could be the capital markets , in the form of a share issue or a bond issue , but might also be from european governments , namely britain , france , germany or spain . the involvement of governments , which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees , is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and the european union . us unhappy at perceived state aid the united states has filed a complaint at the world trade organization alleging the government loans to airbus amount to illegal state aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work will continue on the new planes despite concerns the european union has countered with its own case , alleging that boeing also benefits from illegal state aid , particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts . " the funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet , " eads said . " eads expects to spread the development costs of the full xwb family over the years 2007 to 2014 , with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013 . " aerospace trade war unlikely to subside the us government said friday reports that airbus could resort to state aid to finance nearly half the costs of the a350 were " not encouraging . " " we 're seeking further information from the eu , " us trade representative spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp .
" obviously , the reports of four billion euros in state-guaranteed funds are not encouraging , " she said . boeing spokesman peter conte declined to address the prospect of new state subsidies for airbus , but said the us aviation giant saw no threat from the a350 project .
" this does not come as any surprise and nor would we trade our position with anyone , " he said .
" we feel very good about the position that we are in with both the 777 and 787 . " airbus chief sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 decision comes as a great relief to gallois the chief executive of airbus and eads co-chief executive louis gallois commented on the decision to launch the a350 : " the a350 xwb has it all to become a great success - the most advanced technologies , the best economics and the highest level of comfort . " news of the investment in the a350 will also come as relief to workers and suppliers in the european aerospace industry , who are facing job losses and cut backs as airbus drills down its costs . the european plane maker has had a torrid year , hit by repeated delays to its flagship a380 project and major management upheaval . in the battle for new orders , airbus has also come second best to a resurgent boeing . airbus announced friday it had booked 635 orders in the first 11 months of this year compared with 823 orders for boeing . nevertheless , the european group is set to have the second best year in its history this year in terms of new orders - after setting a record in 2005 - as airlines continue to expand their services globally and renew ageing fleets . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

" we had a chance to go top but we did not take it , " said german international thomas hitzlsperger .
" i suppose it is good that people expect us to get more than a point as it shows how far we have progressed .
we just hope to get back to winning ways next weekend . " for mainz , who prop up the german table , it was a vital point in their bid to beat the drop . mainz beat english giants liverpool 5-0 in a pre-season friendly and that is threatening to be the highlight of their season . profligacy in front of goal hinders both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp saw his side miss a host of chances former stuttgart striker imre szabics should have scored against his old club after just five minutes but the hungarian international missed an open goal side-footing over when it appeared easier to score . " a 0-0 against stuttgart is not so bad but we could have had so much more , " said mainz goalkeeper christian wetklo .
" we missed the chance to take the lead early on and that would have made it much easier as we could sit back and play on the counter attack more . " stuttgart are averaging almost two goals a game this season but they looked out of sorts as an attacking force . indeed the other good chance of a drab first half fell to szabics who headed over when well-placed . in the second half stuttgart upped the ante with german under-21 international mario gomez , eight goals to his name already this season , twice going close . however it was mainz who looked the more likely to take the spoils , but some wayward finishing leaves them still searching for their first win since the opening day of the season . bayern , bremen hoping to close gap at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and bremen are battling for top spot defending champions bayern munich , currently in fourth , have the chance to move level on points with schalke providing they can defeat borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
gladbach are managed by juup heynckes who won the german title as bayern coach in 1989 and 1990 . werder bremen entertain hertha berlin , a creditable fifth , on saturday trying to keep their focus on the league ahead of tuesday 's champions league showdown with barcelona . bremen need just a point at the nou camp to reach the last 16 of the competition and eliminate the holders . if they can overcome hertha they will replace schalke , currently two points ahead , at the top with the latter in action against nuremberg on sunday . the german season is reaching its halfway point and after this weekend there are only two more games left before the six-week winter break . traditionally the team top at christmas , labeled the ' winter champions ' , goes on to lift the title in may - as bayern have done the past two seasons - so the four teams in contention will be desperate for that psychological edge . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de makaay stands out from munich mediocrity by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .

it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic . " european standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed audience at an open-air movie in dresden this protest in germany comes as some european parliamentarians are calling for the european commission to implement compulsory copyright regulations instead of merely making " recommendations . "
these issues are creating headaches world-wide as computer firms , record companies and artists fight for control of the digital market . according to germany 's organization for film economy , spio , in 2005 127 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide .
the film industry 's total turnover was 745 million euros -lrb- $ 980 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 02.12.2006 film directors protest against new german copyright law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good old movie theaters still draw in the crowds over 100 of germany 's most prominent filmmakers have protested against the government 's new copyright laws which they claim infringe on their artistic property rights . earlier this week , a delegation from the german film directors ' association handed over a petition to justice minister brigitte zypries , who is responsible for the amendment which has just been passed by the cabinet .
the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic . " european standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed audience at an open-air movie in dresden this protest in germany comes as some european parliamentarians are calling for the european commission to implement compulsory copyright regulations instead of merely making " recommendations . "
these issues are creating headaches world-wide as computer firms , record companies and artists fight for control of the digital market . according to germany 's organization for film economy , spio , in 2005 127 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide .
the film industry 's total turnover was 745 million euros -lrb- $ 980 million -rrb- .
150 german feature and documentary movies made up roughly 17 percent of the total market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic . " european standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed audience at an open-air movie in dresden this protest in germany comes as some european parliamentarians are calling for the european commission to implement compulsory copyright regulations instead of merely making " recommendations . "
these issues are creating headaches world-wide as computer firms , record companies and artists fight for control of the digital market . according to germany 's organization for film economy , spio , in 2005 127 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide .
the film industry 's total turnover was 745 million euros -lrb- $ 980 million -rrb- .
150 german feature and documentary movies made up roughly 17 percent of the total market .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .
it re-emerged in july this year as the a350 xwb , which stands for extra wide body . financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and , tellingly , airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 13-billion -rrb- project would be paid for . eads and airbus , a 100-percent-owned unit of eads , are stretched for cash because of cost over-runs with the airbus a380 superjumbo project , which is running two years behind schedule . as a result , eads stressed on friday that the decision on the a350 was linked to the " full implementation " of a vast restructuring plan called power 8 , which aims to cut costs throughout the business . company cash not state funding for a350 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding for the a350 will come from a number of sources it said the a350 would be financed " predominantly from the company cash flows " and also from " risk sharing partners . "
nevertheless , eads and airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project . other sources could be the capital markets , in the form of a share issue or a bond issue , but might also be from european governments , namely britain , france , germany or spain . the involvement of governments , which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees , is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and the european union . us unhappy at perceived state aid the united states has filed a complaint at the world trade organization alleging the government loans to airbus amount to illegal state aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work will continue on the new planes despite concerns the european union has countered with its own case , alleging that boeing also benefits from illegal state aid , particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts . " the funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet , " eads said . " eads expects to spread the development costs of the full xwb family over the years 2007 to 2014 , with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013 . " aerospace trade war unlikely to subside the us government said friday reports that airbus could resort to state aid to finance nearly half the costs of the a350 were " not encouraging . " " we 're seeking further information from the eu , " us trade representative spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp .
" obviously , the reports of four billion euros in state-guaranteed funds are not encouraging , " she said . boeing spokesman peter conte declined to address the prospect of new state subsidies for airbus , but said the us aviation giant saw no threat from the a350 project .
" this does not come as any surprise and nor would we trade our position with anyone , " he said .
" we feel very good about the position that we are in with both the 777 and 787 . " airbus chief sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 decision comes as a great relief to gallois the chief executive of airbus and eads co-chief executive louis gallois commented on the decision to launch the a350 : " the a350 xwb has it all to become a great success - the most advanced technologies , the best economics and the highest level of comfort . " news of the investment in the a350 will also come as relief to workers and suppliers in the european aerospace industry , who are facing job losses and cut backs as airbus drills down its costs . the european plane maker has had a torrid year , hit by repeated delays to its flagship a380 project and major management upheaval . in the battle for new orders , airbus has also come second best to a resurgent boeing . airbus announced friday it had booked 635 orders in the first 11 months of this year compared with 823 orders for boeing . nevertheless , the european group is set to have the second best year in its history this year in terms of new orders - after setting a record in 2005 - as airlines continue to expand their services globally and renew ageing fleets . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .

during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 02.12.2006 german underwear firm eyes fashion-conscious chinese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german underwear is about to hit the chinese market bruno banani 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm 's directors want to woo chinese fashionistas . bruno banani is an east german success story .
based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .

bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .

based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .

it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .
the pro-syria and hezbollah demonstrations may also threaten frank-walter steinmeier 's expected trip to damascus on monday . damascus visit could ease tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's syria could hold the key to peace in the region his last scheduled visit to the syrian capital in august was cancelled after syrian president bashar al-assad made statements condemning israel and offered praise to hezbollah for its war against the jewish state this summer . however , after stating friday that syria 's involvement was integral to regional peace efforts , steinmeier may use the opportunity to discuss assad 's influence in lebanon and attempt to diffuse the situation .

steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .

the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic . " european standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed audience at an open-air movie in dresden this protest in germany comes as some european parliamentarians are calling for the european commission to implement compulsory copyright regulations instead of merely making " recommendations . "
these issues are creating headaches world-wide as computer firms , record companies and artists fight for control of the digital market . according to germany 's organization for film economy , spio , in 2005 127 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide .
the film industry 's total turnover was 745 million euros -lrb- $ 980 million -rrb- .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .
it re-emerged in july this year as the a350 xwb , which stands for extra wide body . financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and , tellingly , airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 13-billion -rrb- project would be paid for . eads and airbus , a 100-percent-owned unit of eads , are stretched for cash because of cost over-runs with the airbus a380 superjumbo project , which is running two years behind schedule . as a result , eads stressed on friday that the decision on the a350 was linked to the " full implementation " of a vast restructuring plan called power 8 , which aims to cut costs throughout the business . company cash not state funding for a350 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding for the a350 will come from a number of sources it said the a350 would be financed " predominantly from the company cash flows " and also from " risk sharing partners . "
nevertheless , eads and airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project . other sources could be the capital markets , in the form of a share issue or a bond issue , but might also be from european governments , namely britain , france , germany or spain . the involvement of governments , which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees , is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and the european union . us unhappy at perceived state aid the united states has filed a complaint at the world trade organization alleging the government loans to airbus amount to illegal state aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work will continue on the new planes despite concerns the european union has countered with its own case , alleging that boeing also benefits from illegal state aid , particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts . " the funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet , " eads said . " eads expects to spread the development costs of the full xwb family over the years 2007 to 2014 , with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013 . " aerospace trade war unlikely to subside the us government said friday reports that airbus could resort to state aid to finance nearly half the costs of the a350 were " not encouraging . " " we 're seeking further information from the eu , " us trade representative spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp .
" obviously , the reports of four billion euros in state-guaranteed funds are not encouraging , " she said . boeing spokesman peter conte declined to address the prospect of new state subsidies for airbus , but said the us aviation giant saw no threat from the a350 project .
" this does not come as any surprise and nor would we trade our position with anyone , " he said .
" we feel very good about the position that we are in with both the 777 and 787 . " airbus chief sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 decision comes as a great relief to gallois the chief executive of airbus and eads co-chief executive louis gallois commented on the decision to launch the a350 : " the a350 xwb has it all to become a great success - the most advanced technologies , the best economics and the highest level of comfort . " news of the investment in the a350 will also come as relief to workers and suppliers in the european aerospace industry , who are facing job losses and cut backs as airbus drills down its costs . the european plane maker has had a torrid year , hit by repeated delays to its flagship a380 project and major management upheaval . in the battle for new orders , airbus has also come second best to a resurgent boeing . airbus announced friday it had booked 635 orders in the first 11 months of this year compared with 823 orders for boeing . nevertheless , the european group is set to have the second best year in its history this year in terms of new orders - after setting a record in 2005 - as airlines continue to expand their services globally and renew ageing fleets . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .
the pro-syria and hezbollah demonstrations may also threaten frank-walter steinmeier 's expected trip to damascus on monday . damascus visit could ease tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's syria could hold the key to peace in the region his last scheduled visit to the syrian capital in august was cancelled after syrian president bashar al-assad made statements condemning israel and offered praise to hezbollah for its war against the jewish state this summer . however , after stating friday that syria 's involvement was integral to regional peace efforts , steinmeier may use the opportunity to discuss assad 's influence in lebanon and attempt to diffuse the situation .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .

steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .

based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .
dw-world.de spoke with schmidt about his ties to china and the country 's growing global clout .

german businesses lose billions as a result , and offers to cooperate with counterfeiters do n't seem to help .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .
the pro-syria and hezbollah demonstrations may also threaten frank-walter steinmeier 's expected trip to damascus on monday . damascus visit could ease tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's syria could hold the key to peace in the region his last scheduled visit to the syrian capital in august was cancelled after syrian president bashar al-assad made statements condemning israel and offered praise to hezbollah for its war against the jewish state this summer . however , after stating friday that syria 's involvement was integral to regional peace efforts , steinmeier may use the opportunity to discuss assad 's influence in lebanon and attempt to diffuse the situation .
the german contingent , however , have no official appointments in syria at this time . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier urges syria to join talks in push for mid-east peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke about his hopes for a lasting peace in the middle east after meeting with g8 and gulf state officials in jordan friday and urged syria to join negotiations .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .

based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

" the company 's chief executive , hartmut mehdorn , had previously resisted the idea , arguing that railway stations were not the right place for such a serious topic " because they are too crowded and people are in too much of a hurry to concentrate .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .

the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .

ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de fashion -pipe- 02.12.2006 german underwear firm eyes fashion-conscious chinese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east german underwear is about to hit the chinese market bruno banani 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm 's directors want to woo chinese fashionistas . bruno banani is an east german success story .
based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

" we missed the chance to take the lead early on and that would have made it much easier as we could sit back and play on the counter attack more . " stuttgart are averaging almost two goals a game this season but they looked out of sorts as an attacking force . indeed the other good chance of a drab first half fell to szabics who headed over when well-placed . in the second half stuttgart upped the ante with german under-21 international mario gomez , eight goals to his name already this season , twice going close . however it was mainz who looked the more likely to take the spoils , but some wayward finishing leaves them still searching for their first win since the opening day of the season . bayern , bremen hoping to close gap at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and bremen are battling for top spot defending champions bayern munich , currently in fourth , have the chance to move level on points with schalke providing they can defeat borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .

but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 02.12.2006 makaay stands out from munich mediocrity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay is having his usual quietly productive season by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .

one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic .

the " filmmakers resolution " was also delivered to chancellor angela merkel and culture minister bernd neumann , among others . the government aims to revolutionize intellectual property rights by bringing them into compliance with the demands of the new information society .
it aims to develop a balance of interests between artists and users , and the recording device and cultural industries . up until now , copyright law has stipulated that a certain fixed amount be added to the cost of a recording device , such as a vcr .
however , the new reforms will allow the makers of printers , cd-burners and dvd recorders and other such devices to negotiate an " appropriate " amount with collecting societies . the law will impose an upper limit of five percent of the cost of the respective device . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director volker schlöndorff artists fear they will suffer considerable financial losses because of the constant falling prices of new recording devices .
the firms which make these devices on the other hand have welcomed the reforms . because of the complexities involved , the law will probably only come into effect at the beginning of 2007 and the petition 's signatories hope to prevent this from happening . they include veteran filmmakers volker schlöndorff and margarethe von trotta , as well as " sophie scholl " director marc rothemund , and doris dörrie of " men " fame .
roland emmerich and oliver hirschbiegel have offered their support from across the atlantic . future delivery methods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie-house of the future ?
one clause that has yet to be passed has raised particular concern to the filmmakers .
until now it has not been allowed to write unknown devices or delivery methods into a contract about the future use of an artistic work .
the new law will lift this ban , removing the right of filmmakers to write into a contract a refusal that their work be transferred by unknown delivery methods . in the new digital media age , movies are already downloadable from the internet and can be watched on mp3 devices and cell-phones .
the directors claim it would infringe on their intellectual property rights not to have a say in how the industry allows their work to be used by unknown means .
the worry is that their work might be altered significantly . " we do not want our work to be sold at a loss , " they said .
" instead , we want to use dialog and cooperation to make sure our work is delivered by new methods in such a vigilant way that its content remains authentic . " european standards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a packed audience at an open-air movie in dresden this protest in germany comes as some european parliamentarians are calling for the european commission to implement compulsory copyright regulations instead of merely making " recommendations . "
these issues are creating headaches world-wide as computer firms , record companies and artists fight for control of the digital market . according to germany 's organization for film economy , spio , in 2005 127 million cinema tickets were sold nationwide .
the film industry 's total turnover was 745 million euros -lrb- $ 980 million -rrb- .
150 german feature and documentary movies made up roughly 17 percent of the total market .

so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns .

so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .
it re-emerged in july this year as the a350 xwb , which stands for extra wide body . financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and , tellingly , airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 13-billion -rrb- project would be paid for . eads and airbus , a 100-percent-owned unit of eads , are stretched for cash because of cost over-runs with the airbus a380 superjumbo project , which is running two years behind schedule . as a result , eads stressed on friday that the decision on the a350 was linked to the " full implementation " of a vast restructuring plan called power 8 , which aims to cut costs throughout the business . company cash not state funding for a350 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding for the a350 will come from a number of sources it said the a350 would be financed " predominantly from the company cash flows " and also from " risk sharing partners . "
nevertheless , eads and airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project . other sources could be the capital markets , in the form of a share issue or a bond issue , but might also be from european governments , namely britain , france , germany or spain . the involvement of governments , which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees , is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and the european union . us unhappy at perceived state aid the united states has filed a complaint at the world trade organization alleging the government loans to airbus amount to illegal state aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work will continue on the new planes despite concerns the european union has countered with its own case , alleging that boeing also benefits from illegal state aid , particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts . " the funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet , " eads said . " eads expects to spread the development costs of the full xwb family over the years 2007 to 2014 , with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013 . " aerospace trade war unlikely to subside the us government said friday reports that airbus could resort to state aid to finance nearly half the costs of the a350 were " not encouraging . " " we 're seeking further information from the eu , " us trade representative spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp .
" obviously , the reports of four billion euros in state-guaranteed funds are not encouraging , " she said . boeing spokesman peter conte declined to address the prospect of new state subsidies for airbus , but said the us aviation giant saw no threat from the a350 project .
" this does not come as any surprise and nor would we trade our position with anyone , " he said .
" we feel very good about the position that we are in with both the 777 and 787 . " airbus chief sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 decision comes as a great relief to gallois the chief executive of airbus and eads co-chief executive louis gallois commented on the decision to launch the a350 : " the a350 xwb has it all to become a great success - the most advanced technologies , the best economics and the highest level of comfort . " news of the investment in the a350 will also come as relief to workers and suppliers in the european aerospace industry , who are facing job losses and cut backs as airbus drills down its costs . the european plane maker has had a torrid year , hit by repeated delays to its flagship a380 project and major management upheaval . in the battle for new orders , airbus has also come second best to a resurgent boeing . airbus announced friday it had booked 635 orders in the first 11 months of this year compared with 823 orders for boeing . nevertheless , the european group is set to have the second best year in its history this year in terms of new orders - after setting a record in 2005 - as airlines continue to expand their services globally and renew ageing fleets . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .

they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse . having struck eight times in 13 bundesliga matches this season , dutch striker roy makaay is tied for second in the league 's goal-scorer 's list - one behind hertha berlin 's marco pantelic .
but his real value to bayern munich only emerges when one considers where the team would be if he had n't found the net so often .
bayern may be dismayed by their current fourth-place standing in the table .
but without makaay 's goals , mighty munich would have only 19 points , which would put the defending champs down in the mid-table doldrums with the likes of wolfsburg and dortmund .
and the dutchman would likely have had nine goals , had not strike partner claudio pizarro jumped places in the pecking order in bayern 's october match against frankfurt , taking - and missing - a penalty that should have been makaay 's .
the two have since made up , and thanks to makaay , bayern remain very much in the title hunt .
the irony is that he 's often been one of the most criticized members of the squad .
the numbers do n't lie bildunterschrift : for the past three years , there 's been no better bundesliga striker than makaay in 2003 , bayern paid 18.7 million euros -lrb- $ 24.6 million -rrb- to spanish side deportivo la coruna to acquire makaay , making him the most expensive transfer in munich history .
it 's an investment that has paid off .
makaay has scored 70 goals in 109 games for the bavarians and has been the bundesliga 's most productive striker over the past three years - even ahead of bremen 's scoring machine miroslav klose .
yet makaay 's relationship with munich coach felix magath has never been overly chummy - with magath occasionally choosing to bench or substitute the dutchman early on in matches .
part of the reason is that makaay can remain relatively invisible for much of a game , only to pounce suddenly when the opposing defense has let down its guard .
during the off-season , rumors abounded that bayern were trying to off-load makaay as part of a bid to bring fellow dutchman ruud van nistelrooy to the allianz arena .
that deal never got off the ground .
ruud is currently ripping things up in the spanish primera division , while roy is playing his role in keeping bayern within striking distance of the bundesliga lead .
the soft-spoken makaay is n't the type of player who blows his own horn , and that 's perhaps also why he comes in for so much criticism .
but this year he 's once again proving his worth to bayern .
and by the end of the season , fans can expect him , barring injury , to be once again among the bundesliga 's top five goal scorers . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart 's win over gladbach adds pressure on leaders schalke schalke 04 's lead at the top of the bundesliga was cut on sunday as vfb stuttgart returned to the chasing pack with a nervy 1-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach on sunday .

" we missed the chance to take the lead early on and that would have made it much easier as we could sit back and play on the counter attack more .

based in chemnitz , formerly known as karl-marx-stadt , in east germany , the company was founded in 1993 and is still run by the same two men - wolfgang jassner , an entrepreneur from southern germany and klaus jungnickel , an underwear producer from the east .
they now employ over 100 people and in 2006 , the firm 's profits rose by 11 percent to 55 million euros -lrb- $ 72.4 million -rrb- . the company 's expensive underwear adorns the bodies of hip europeans - now the firm wants to woo the up-and-coming fashionistas of the people 's republic of china . " not for everybody , " is how this exclusive firm defines its products , which include fragrances , sunglasses , watches and swimwear , as well as women 's lingerie and underwear for men . the expensive brand has already made its mark in the european union , russia and south korea , and the company directors are keen to similarly conquer the chinese market . the plan is to open 50 stores over three years in shanghai , beijing and other big cities across the country .
so far in 2006 , 18 stores have opened up and seven more are set to follow next year . although the firm 's web site is written not only in german and english but also in chinese , the company does not intend to tailor its products specifically for the chinese market nor use chinese models in its advertising campaigns . " young professionals with the necessary cash " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani for men what distinguishes this venture is that bruno banani 's underwear is produced in germany and exported to china , arguably the textile factory of the world .
it 's almost like selling ice to the eskimos . yet company director wolfgang jassner is sure they 're onto a winner . " our target group is the same in china as elsewhere - young professionals with an interest in brands and the necessary cash , " he said . the chinese prices are on a par with the german ones .
men 's underwear starts at 20 euros and women 's tops start at 25 euros .
the chinese gdp per capita was roughly 5,200 euros in 2005 . nonetheless , in the booming people 's republic , the awareness of expensive brand-names is on the up , and bruno banani hopes to cash in on this trend . " made in germany " goes to china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani 's latest underwear collection although it is common practice for german automobile producers and other export industries such as engineering , chemicals and pharmaceuticals to export to china , german textile producers selling to the people 's republic are few and far between . only german textile products which are associated particularly with quality or a certain brand image can really make it in china , according to the german-asia pacific association . the small german clothing company trigema , based in burladingen in south-west germany , claims that it produces everything in germany .
however , its export market is only tiny and does not include china .
the german designer brand hugo boss on the other hand is well-represented in the chinese market , but only produces single components in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno banani ceo wolfgang jassner according to its own statistics , a quarter of bruno banani 's turnover is made up in exports and this is a growing trend .
the company 's high-tech underwear is still sewn in saxony in the east . " we can find highly-qualified personnel in germany and can quickly pick up on trends here and respond to the market , " jassner said .
referring to high wage costs , he added that " germany 's economic situation is still good and we can afford them as a producer of high-value products " . moreover , most of the hi-tech materials that the firm uses are not readily available in china yet , such as microfiber .
this also means that the underwear will not be easily copied in china . dw staff -lrb- act -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " china is going to overtake germany in the next few years " former german chancellor helmut schmidt will hold talks with chinese premier wen jiabao during a summit in hamburg .
dw-world.de spoke with schmidt about his ties to china and the country 's growing global clout .
-lrb- 13.09.2006 -rrb- merkel talked more than business in beijing it seemed so casual , but could not have been planned more carefully : the first day of merkel 's ' getting to know you ' visit to china went off without a hitch .

german businesses lose billions as a result , and offers to cooperate with counterfeiters do n't seem to help .
-lrb- 22.05.2006 -rrb- fashion grows up hear the words pin-up and calendar and most people will probably think of expensive shoots featuring cindy crawford and heidi klum .
but one calendar printed in berlin prefers girls who 've lived a little .

but steinmeier 's visit to beirut is in doubt after pro-syria and hezbollah supporters laid siege to government buildings . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier continues his middle east tour saturday with meetings with palestinian president mahmud abbas for talks on strengthening a fragile week-old ceasefire in the gaza strip and raising hopes of reviving the stalled peace process . steinmeier , who will attend the discussions with austrian counterpart ursula plassinik and the european union 's top diplomat javier solana , arrived in the region on friday for meetings with gulf state and g8 officials in jordan ahead of germany 's eu presidency which begins on jan .
1 . the eu contingent 's sit-down with abbas comes hard on the heels of the president 's talks with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in jericho thursday after which both called for a complete ceasefire between israel and palestinian militants . the truce that has been in place since sunday applies only to the gaza strip and not to the west bank .
it calls for palestinian militants to stop firing rockets into the jewish state in exchange for the withdrawal of israeli troops from the gaza strip . since the ceasefire , however , palestinian militants have fired rockets at israel four times in violation of the agreement , prompting israeli threats to resume its offensive . steinmeier to urge action on coalition agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier will urge abbas to heal the rifts in the pa steinmeier is expected to reiterate comments made on friday that the formation of a stabile palestinian government would be the clearest sign yet to israel that negotiations over a lasting peace could begin .
abbas 's fatah movement is currently in the midst of a power struggle with the militant hamas over the failure to form a moderate coalition that could win international recognition and help end a foreign aid boycott . meanwhile , the next leg of steinmeier 's tour was thrown into doubt as the lebanese cabinet of prime minister fuad siniora came under siege in beirut after a massive demonstration on friday led by the pro-syrian group hezbollah ended with thousands of protesters camping outside government offices .
steinmeier is due for talks with siniora later on saturday but the current protests may make that visit impossible . friday 's massive show of force in central beirut tightened the political deadlock in the country which has been in near-paralysis because of a fierce power struggle between the pro- and anti-syrian camps . siniora government under peaceful siege - for now bildunterschrift : crowds of protesters thronged the streets of the capital on friday , calling for the ouster of the " corrupt " leadership and temporarily blocking access to siniora 's government headquarters . the siniora government , which has received strong public backing from western and arab states , pledged not to bow to the opposition led by the syrian- and iranian-backed hezbollah .
some pro-government newspapers spoke of the beginnings of an attempted coup . hezbollah-led demonstrators set up tents and several thousand protesters were still camping early saturday on at least two main public roads leading to siniora 's offices , after the blockade was eased to allow access from side roads . the demonstrators said they will stay until the government gives in , and threatened to escalate their actions in the coming days .
the pro-syria and hezbollah demonstrations may also threaten frank-walter steinmeier 's expected trip to damascus on monday . damascus visit could ease tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assad 's syria could hold the key to peace in the region his last scheduled visit to the syrian capital in august was cancelled after syrian president bashar al-assad made statements condemning israel and offered praise to hezbollah for its war against the jewish state this summer . however , after stating friday that syria 's involvement was integral to regional peace efforts , steinmeier may use the opportunity to discuss assad 's influence in lebanon and attempt to diffuse the situation .

" we had a chance to go top but we did not take it , " said german international thomas hitzlsperger .
" i suppose it is good that people expect us to get more than a point as it shows how far we have progressed .
we just hope to get back to winning ways next weekend . " for mainz , who prop up the german table , it was a vital point in their bid to beat the drop . mainz beat english giants liverpool 5-0 in a pre-season friendly and that is threatening to be the highlight of their season . profligacy in front of goal hinders both sides bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz coach jürgen klopp saw his side miss a host of chances former stuttgart striker imre szabics should have scored against his old club after just five minutes but the hungarian international missed an open goal side-footing over when it appeared easier to score . " a 0-0 against stuttgart is not so bad but we could have had so much more , " said mainz goalkeeper christian wetklo .
" we missed the chance to take the lead early on and that would have made it much easier as we could sit back and play on the counter attack more . " stuttgart are averaging almost two goals a game this season but they looked out of sorts as an attacking force . indeed the other good chance of a drab first half fell to szabics who headed over when well-placed . in the second half stuttgart upped the ante with german under-21 international mario gomez , eight goals to his name already this season , twice going close . however it was mainz who looked the more likely to take the spoils , but some wayward finishing leaves them still searching for their first win since the opening day of the season . bayern , bremen hoping to close gap at the top bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern and bremen are battling for top spot defending champions bayern munich , currently in fourth , have the chance to move level on points with schalke providing they can defeat borussia mönchengladbach on saturday .
gladbach are managed by juup heynckes who won the german title as bayern coach in 1989 and 1990 . werder bremen entertain hertha berlin , a creditable fifth , on saturday trying to keep their focus on the league ahead of tuesday 's champions league showdown with barcelona . bremen need just a point at the nou camp to reach the last 16 of the competition and eliminate the holders . if they can overcome hertha they will replace schalke , currently two points ahead , at the top with the latter in action against nuremberg on sunday . the german season is reaching its halfway point and after this weekend there are only two more games left before the six-week winter break . traditionally the team top at christmas , labeled the ' winter champions ' , goes on to lift the title in may - as bayern have done the past two seasons - so the four teams in contention will be desperate for that psychological edge . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de makaay stands out from munich mediocrity by bayern munich 's standards , this has been a very disappointing season .
they 're fourth in the table - three points behind rivals schalke .
but without heavily criticized striker roy makaay , things would be far worse .

" the a350 xwb , together with the a330 / a340 aircraft family , will meet a market that requires some 5,700 new aircraft being delivered in the next two decades , with more than 1,000 billion dollars in value , " the statement said . the twin-engine airbus a350 has been designed to compete with two boeing airliners , the existing 777 and the future 787 dreamliner , which has proved highly popular with airlines . airbus said the first a350 would enter service in 2013 , five years after the new boeing 787 . initially drawn up in 2005 , the airbus a350 design was sent back to the drawing board after prospective clients complained of insufficient passenger capacity and excessive fuel consumption .
it re-emerged in july this year as the a350 xwb , which stands for extra wide body . financing of the project is considered by analysts to be a critical issue and , tellingly , airbus was vague about the details of how the 10-billion-euro -lrb- $ 13-billion -rrb- project would be paid for . eads and airbus , a 100-percent-owned unit of eads , are stretched for cash because of cost over-runs with the airbus a380 superjumbo project , which is running two years behind schedule . as a result , eads stressed on friday that the decision on the a350 was linked to the " full implementation " of a vast restructuring plan called power 8 , which aims to cut costs throughout the business . company cash not state funding for a350 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : funding for the a350 will come from a number of sources it said the a350 would be financed " predominantly from the company cash flows " and also from " risk sharing partners . "
nevertheless , eads and airbus are still expected to need other sources of capital to finance the project . other sources could be the capital markets , in the form of a share issue or a bond issue , but might also be from european governments , namely britain , france , germany or spain . the involvement of governments , which are able to grant low-interest loans or guarantees , is a prickly issue given the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and the european union . us unhappy at perceived state aid the united states has filed a complaint at the world trade organization alleging the government loans to airbus amount to illegal state aid . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work will continue on the new planes despite concerns the european union has countered with its own case , alleging that boeing also benefits from illegal state aid , particularly in the form of uncontested military contracts . " the funding requirements going forward will be proactively managed in line with company policy to preserve a strong balance sheet , " eads said . " eads expects to spread the development costs of the full xwb family over the years 2007 to 2014 , with the bulk of the spending occurring in 2010-2013 . " aerospace trade war unlikely to subside the us government said friday reports that airbus could resort to state aid to finance nearly half the costs of the a350 were " not encouraging . " " we 're seeking further information from the eu , " us trade representative spokeswoman gretchen hamel told afp .
" obviously , the reports of four billion euros in state-guaranteed funds are not encouraging , " she said . boeing spokesman peter conte declined to address the prospect of new state subsidies for airbus , but said the us aviation giant saw no threat from the a350 project .
" this does not come as any surprise and nor would we trade our position with anyone , " he said .
" we feel very good about the position that we are in with both the 777 and 787 . " airbus chief sees bright future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a350 decision comes as a great relief to gallois the chief executive of airbus and eads co-chief executive louis gallois commented on the decision to launch the a350 : " the a350 xwb has it all to become a great success - the most advanced technologies , the best economics and the highest level of comfort . " news of the investment in the a350 will also come as relief to workers and suppliers in the european aerospace industry , who are facing job losses and cut backs as airbus drills down its costs . the european plane maker has had a torrid year , hit by repeated delays to its flagship a380 project and major management upheaval . in the battle for new orders , airbus has also come second best to a resurgent boeing . airbus announced friday it had booked 635 orders in the first 11 months of this year compared with 823 orders for boeing . nevertheless , the european group is set to have the second best year in its history this year in terms of new orders - after setting a record in 2005 - as airlines continue to expand their services globally and renew ageing fleets . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus decision on a350 looms amid us-eu trade dispute airbus has said it would not launch a new medium-sized jetliner before completing its restructuring plan .
but the financing of the a350 could exacerbate tensions between the us and the eu .

he had spent the previous day in hiding after a 24-hour deadline for avoiding a military coup set by cmdr bainimarama passed without incident .
fiji has been tense for weeks amid a stand-off between the two men .
mr qarase said he hoped that dialogue would continue between the government and the military .
who 's saying the deadline has been extended ?
cmdr bainimarama " i will try my best to be in power for the next four and a half years , " he added when asked whether he would still be in power next week .
however , cmdr bainimarama told the fiji sun newspaper that he would be the one setting the deadline not the prime minister .
" i am his boss , " he said .
prime minister qarase told reuters news agency on friday : " the deadline has now passed .
i have been informed that the new deadline is monday midday . "
but the military chief told ap news agency that mr qarase had no reason to claim a reprieve .
" who 's saying the deadline has been extended ? " he asked .
" is he the commander ?
i am the commander , " he added .

we will be asking children if they feel protected - if they feel safe going to school and on the streets melvyn williams , funky dragon the information will be presented to the un next year .
groups including welsh children and young people 's organisation funky dragon and charity save the children are involved in compiling the report , which they hope will provide the most comprehensive picture ever of children 's rights in wales .
in addition to a wales-wide survey , funky dragon will conduct focus groups and case studies to get as many children 's views as possible .
melvyn williams of funky dragon said the research would look at child protection , provision and participation .
mr williams explained : " we will be asking children if they feel protected - if they feel safe going to school and on the streets .
children will give their views on issues such as poverty " provision means poverty , looking at how many have free school meals and other indicators .
" participation is whether children are getting their voices heard in school , in their communities or at home . "
the information gathered will go into the first uk-wide report to the united nations as well as more specific reports which will inform government policy in wales .
mr williams said : " this is the first time this information will have come from the uk .
" we 'll be surveying thousands of children in 44 schools across wales .
" when reports to the un are given by governments , they tend to put a positive spin on things , but this is a chance for children themselves to have their say . "
' long journey ' rhian croke , uncrc monitoring officer for save the children wales , said the purpose of the research was to raise awareness of children 's rights as well as find out about issues they may have .
she added : " it 's about getting young people to understand they have human rights .
" the un convention sets a high standard for children 's rights but in wales we are trying to work towards that .
" we have n't met all aspects of children 's rights yet and it 's going to be a long journey getting there .
" this research is exciting - it 's more about the emotions and experiences of young people than about policies . "

the former beatle will go up against singer morrissey and broadcaster sir david attenborough in the bbc poll .
the three were ranked ahead of david bowie , sir michael caine and five other famous faces in the survey , conducted by bbc two 's culture show programme .
the eventual winner , decided by public vote , will be announced on 16 december .
before that , sir paul will be a guest presenter on classic fm next thursday as part of a day of programming dedicated to his life and work .
the 64-year-old is currently promoting his latest classical album , ecce cor meum -lrb- behold my heart -rrb- .
' insecure ' however , it is his personal life rather than his music that has dominated headlines of late .
in an interview with the radio times , mccartney - currently embroiled in an acrimonious divorce dispute with estranged wife heather mills - confirms he has sought psychiatric help in the past .
" i 've seen psychiatrists in my time , " he is quoted as saying .
" it 's not a bad idea to have someone to talk to .
" it 's normally over family matters , " he continues .
the singer also admits to being " occasionally insecure " but says he has no plans to retire .

" the mobile phone went off and that 's what we think brought the attack on .

their son christopher , 15 , has been tested and given the all clear .

mr clinton said that only about a third of those affected by the disaster were back in permanent housing .
he said more action was needed .
the former president is on a tour of tsunami-hit nations in his capacity as un special envoy for tsunami aid .
he has visited thailand and india and is now in indonesia 's aceh province .
more than 200,000 people died in the 26 december 2004 tsunami , which was triggered by an undersea earthquake in the indian ocean .
' speed up rebuilding ' mr clinton received a warm welcome in banda aceh , the capital of the province in northern sumatra that was devastated by the waves .
he visited those left homeless by the disaster , meeting refugees at a camp near banda aceh .
" i hope clinton 's visit can speed up rebuilding of our house , " one refugee , syarifuddin , told the associated press news agency .
" we can not stand living in this unhealthy camp any longer , " mother-of-three hamidah told the agency .
mr clinton will also visit rows of bare temporary housing built as an emergency measure after the tsunami , but which charities estimate still house some 70,000 people , the bbc 's lucy williamson reports from jakarta .
other stops will include a transitional housing project and a recently completed school .
he is also expected to hold meetings with representatives from the indonesian government and the former separatist group , gam , our correspondent adds .
the two sides signed a peace deal last year that was widely attributed to the impact of the tsunami .
on friday , work began on placing the first of a planned network of tsunami early warning buoys in the indian ocean .
the buoy , to be placed between thailand and sri lanka , is able to detect sudden increases in pressure deep under the sea and give coastal communities early warning of a tsunami .
it is hoped that eventually a network of 24 buoys will extend to indonesia and australia , along the deep and unstable fault-line that caused the 2004 earthquake .

mr clinton said that only about a third of those affected by the disaster were back in permanent housing .
he said more action was needed .
the former president is on a tour of tsunami-hit nations in his capacity as un special envoy for tsunami aid .
he has visited thailand and india and is now in indonesia 's aceh province .
more than 200,000 people died in the 26 december 2004 tsunami , which was triggered by an undersea earthquake in the indian ocean .
' speed up rebuilding ' mr clinton received a warm welcome in banda aceh , the capital of the province in northern sumatra that was devastated by the waves .
he visited those left homeless by the disaster , meeting refugees at a camp near banda aceh .
" i hope clinton 's visit can speed up rebuilding of our house , " one refugee , syarifuddin , told the associated press news agency .
" we can not stand living in this unhealthy camp any longer , " mother-of-three hamidah told the agency .
mr clinton will also visit rows of bare temporary housing built as an emergency measure after the tsunami , but which charities estimate still house some 70,000 people , the bbc 's lucy williamson reports from jakarta .
other stops will include a transitional housing project and a recently completed school .
he is also expected to hold meetings with representatives from the indonesian government and the former separatist group , gam , our correspondent adds .
the two sides signed a peace deal last year that was widely attributed to the impact of the tsunami .
on friday , work began on placing the first of a planned network of tsunami early warning buoys in the indian ocean .
the buoy , to be placed between thailand and sri lanka , is able to detect sudden increases in pressure deep under the sea and give coastal communities early warning of a tsunami .
it is hoped that eventually a network of 24 buoys will extend to indonesia and australia , along the deep and unstable fault-line that caused the 2004 earthquake .

more ambitious plans include having a tram link running along oxford street .
