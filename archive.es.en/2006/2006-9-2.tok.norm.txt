ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland . " löw , 46 , took over when jürgen klinsmann quit after the world cup finals when germany finished a creditable third . lingering defensive problems germany start as favorites to win group d and to swat aside ireland but new manager löw has been in the job just over six weeks - far from the perfect preparation - and the new coach faces a defensive crisis . bildunterschrift : marcell jansen will be holding down the right defensive side " eveyone expects two wins from the next two matches but we have problems in defense with a lot of key players out , " germany captain michael ballack said . germany have lost robert huth , per mertesacker , christoph metzelder and jens nowotny to injury and ballack said the midfield need to shoulder the defensive burden . " torsten -lrb- frings -rrb- and i have a duty to help out the defense and provide some stability , " ballack said , adding that the team still intended to play the attacking soccer it did during the world cup . neither side expecting an easy match a 3-0 friendly win over sweden was a promising start for löw but he expects a much tougher game against ireland . " ireland will show typical british values , and i expect them to fight for everything and make it very tough for us , " löw added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw helped develop individual exercises for every player but at the very least the germans will be playing with comfortable feet .
the country 's soccer association reached a deal with adidas allowing players to wear the boots of their choice after some of germany 's most experienced players , including world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , had threatened to boycott the match . ireland failed to qualify for euro 2004 and this summer 's world cup and staunton has been entrusted with the task of making sure his homeland do not miss out again . " i never said it would be easy .
i am just at the start and know what we have to do to be successful , " said staunton .
" however i am optimistic we have enough good players to qualify for the european championships . " room for improvement staunton , 37 , hopes his team do just that and will expect a vast improvement on the 4-0 friendly hammering at home by the netherlands last time out . " it was embarrassing the dutch could have scored more goals , " admitted everton midfielder kevin kilbane . the last time ireland faced germany was in june 2002 when they played out a 1-1 draw in the world cup group stage .
a similar result would no doubt delight staunton . germany are the bookmakers ' favorites to win qualifying group d which contains ireland , the czech republic , slovakia , cyprus , wales and san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw on a high as germany trounce hapless swedes 3-0 germany retained their winning streak in new coach jogi löw 's first game by utterly dominating a woeful sweden side in gelsenkirchen on wednesday night .

" the credibility of cycling hinges on our ability to carry out these measures .

" the deadline is tight .
his mandate is tight .
we need action .
we need a response from iran , " britain 's minister for european affairs , geoff hoon , told reporters after the eu talks in southern finland . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor that could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . solana 's talks with larijani are meant to " clarify " sections of a 21-page iranian response to an incentives deal , which also includes an offer to relaunch talks .
diplomats have suggested the text is , at best , unclear . eu chief looking for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers say there 's no deadline for new talks the eu 's top diplomat said he believes he will soon know if the iranians are serious , given the delaying tactics and gamesmanship widely employed by their representatives in its negotiations in the past . " we are going to start in the coming days and i hope it will be very short .
we do n't need many meetings , " solana told reporters in lappeenranta , southern finland , adding that : " there is no deadline . " the eu foreign ministers are due to meet again on sept .
15 to discuss developments , and solana said those talks would hinge on iran 's response but also the positions of the union 's international partners . " this is not a question of the eu only , this is a question of the eu , the us , russia , china ... there are other partners i have to deal with , " he said . focus on talks not sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of sanctions may scare iran off iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with tehran open without scaring it off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . britain , france and germany - who have been at the forefront of eu efforts to get iran to suspend its enrichment activities in exchange for a package of political and economic incentives - all warned that time was running out . " we do n't want to slam the door , but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . when france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , was asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " hoon issued a veiled threat about the use of sanctions . " it is important to emphasize that the security council process must carry on , " he said .
" we can not allow the iranians to continue to spin out this process the way they 've done in the past .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts .

" the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts . " iranians will never give in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad again makes his point in iran , meanwhile , president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed saturday that his government would stand firm during any negotiations on its nuclear program , which tehran maintains it has a right to develop for atomic energy . " the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland . " löw , 46 , took over when jürgen klinsmann quit after the world cup finals when germany finished a creditable third . lingering defensive problems germany start as favorites to win group d and to swat aside ireland but new manager löw has been in the job just over six weeks - far from the perfect preparation - and the new coach faces a defensive crisis . bildunterschrift : marcell jansen will be holding down the right defensive side " eveyone expects two wins from the next two matches but we have problems in defense with a lot of key players out , " germany captain michael ballack said . germany have lost robert huth , per mertesacker , christoph metzelder and jens nowotny to injury and ballack said the midfield need to shoulder the defensive burden . " torsten -lrb- frings -rrb- and i have a duty to help out the defense and provide some stability , " ballack said , adding that the team still intended to play the attacking soccer it did during the world cup . neither side expecting an easy match a 3-0 friendly win over sweden was a promising start for löw but he expects a much tougher game against ireland . " ireland will show typical british values , and i expect them to fight for everything and make it very tough for us , " löw added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw helped develop individual exercises for every player but at the very least the germans will be playing with comfortable feet .
the country 's soccer association reached a deal with adidas allowing players to wear the boots of their choice after some of germany 's most experienced players , including world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , had threatened to boycott the match . ireland failed to qualify for euro 2004 and this summer 's world cup and staunton has been entrusted with the task of making sure his homeland do not miss out again . " i never said it would be easy .
i am just at the start and know what we have to do to be successful , " said staunton .
" however i am optimistic we have enough good players to qualify for the european championships . " room for improvement staunton , 37 , hopes his team do just that and will expect a vast improvement on the 4-0 friendly hammering at home by the netherlands last time out . " it was embarrassing the dutch could have scored more goals , " admitted everton midfielder kevin kilbane . the last time ireland faced germany was in june 2002 when they played out a 1-1 draw in the world cup group stage .
a similar result would no doubt delight staunton . germany are the bookmakers ' favorites to win qualifying group d which contains ireland , the czech republic , slovakia , cyprus , wales and san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw on a high as germany trounce hapless swedes 3-0 germany retained their winning streak in new coach jogi löw 's first game by utterly dominating a woeful sweden side in gelsenkirchen on wednesday night .

he 's the 305th coach to leave a bundesliga team without finishing a contract in the history of the german league . hanover lost their opening three matches and saturday 's 3-0 defeat to alemannia aachen , who were recently promoted from the second division , nudged them to the bottom of the 18-strong table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of the 11 goals hanover defenders watched hit the back of the net neururer took over the reins in november of last year , but despite the excitement of the 51-year-old 's arrival , the club did not enjoy an upturn in fortunes and have not won a league match since march , though he did keep them clear of last season 's relegation zone with a 12th-place finish . former assistant michael schjönberg was named interim coach until the club can find a long-term replacement capable of turning around hanover , who have n't won in their last 11 matches . the search could take awhile as rumors of other boardroom changes continue to swirl in hanover .
relegated kaiserslautern general manager rene c. jäggi is reported to be considering a move to hanover to help in the search for a new coach to help them meet their goal of being among the bundesliga 's top nine teams by the winter break . schjönberg , who neururer ordered off the training grounds in his last practice session as the team 's coach , will have a chance to make a case for himself sept .

ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland . " löw , 46 , took over when jürgen klinsmann quit after the world cup finals when germany finished a creditable third . lingering defensive problems germany start as favorites to win group d and to swat aside ireland but new manager löw has been in the job just over six weeks - far from the perfect preparation - and the new coach faces a defensive crisis . bildunterschrift : marcell jansen will be holding down the right defensive side " eveyone expects two wins from the next two matches but we have problems in defense with a lot of key players out , " germany captain michael ballack said . germany have lost robert huth , per mertesacker , christoph metzelder and jens nowotny to injury and ballack said the midfield need to shoulder the defensive burden . " torsten -lrb- frings -rrb- and i have a duty to help out the defense and provide some stability , " ballack said , adding that the team still intended to play the attacking soccer it did during the world cup . neither side expecting an easy match a 3-0 friendly win over sweden was a promising start for löw but he expects a much tougher game against ireland . " ireland will show typical british values , and i expect them to fight for everything and make it very tough for us , " löw added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw helped develop individual exercises for every player but at the very least the germans will be playing with comfortable feet .
the country 's soccer association reached a deal with adidas allowing players to wear the boots of their choice after some of germany 's most experienced players , including world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , had threatened to boycott the match . ireland failed to qualify for euro 2004 and this summer 's world cup and staunton has been entrusted with the task of making sure his homeland do not miss out again . " i never said it would be easy .
i am just at the start and know what we have to do to be successful , " said staunton .
" however i am optimistic we have enough good players to qualify for the european championships . " room for improvement staunton , 37 , hopes his team do just that and will expect a vast improvement on the 4-0 friendly hammering at home by the netherlands last time out . " it was embarrassing the dutch could have scored more goals , " admitted everton midfielder kevin kilbane . the last time ireland faced germany was in june 2002 when they played out a 1-1 draw in the world cup group stage .
a similar result would no doubt delight staunton . germany are the bookmakers ' favorites to win qualifying group d which contains ireland , the czech republic , slovakia , cyprus , wales and san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw on a high as germany trounce hapless swedes 3-0 germany retained their winning streak in new coach jogi löw 's first game by utterly dominating a woeful sweden side in gelsenkirchen on wednesday night .

17 , 2006 -rrb- new coach löw stays loyal to germany 's soccer master plan joachim löw will step out of jürgen klinsmann 's shadow and into the international spotlight wednesday when he takes sole charge of the german national team for the first time for a friendly against sweden .

when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .

" the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week .

" the deadline is tight .
his mandate is tight .
we need action .
we need a response from iran , " britain 's minister for european affairs , geoff hoon , told reporters after the eu talks in southern finland . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor that could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . solana 's talks with larijani are meant to " clarify " sections of a 21-page iranian response to an incentives deal , which also includes an offer to relaunch talks .
diplomats have suggested the text is , at best , unclear . eu chief looking for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers say there 's no deadline for new talks the eu 's top diplomat said he believes he will soon know if the iranians are serious , given the delaying tactics and gamesmanship widely employed by their representatives in its negotiations in the past . " we are going to start in the coming days and i hope it will be very short .
we do n't need many meetings , " solana told reporters in lappeenranta , southern finland , adding that : " there is no deadline . " the eu foreign ministers are due to meet again on sept .
15 to discuss developments , and solana said those talks would hinge on iran 's response but also the positions of the union 's international partners . " this is not a question of the eu only , this is a question of the eu , the us , russia , china ... there are other partners i have to deal with , " he said . focus on talks not sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of sanctions may scare iran off iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with tehran open without scaring it off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . britain , france and germany - who have been at the forefront of eu efforts to get iran to suspend its enrichment activities in exchange for a package of political and economic incentives - all warned that time was running out . " we do n't want to slam the door , but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . when france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , was asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " hoon issued a veiled threat about the use of sanctions . " it is important to emphasize that the security council process must carry on , " he said .
" we can not allow the iranians to continue to spin out this process the way they 've done in the past . " eu : no interest in escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to see iran move toward the negotiating table but steinmeier suggested that any moves in that direction at the united nations could be counter-productive .

he 's the 305th coach to leave a bundesliga team without finishing a contract in the history of the german league . hanover lost their opening three matches and saturday 's 3-0 defeat to alemannia aachen , who were recently promoted from the second division , nudged them to the bottom of the 18-strong table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of the 11 goals hanover defenders watched hit the back of the net neururer took over the reins in november of last year , but despite the excitement of the 51-year-old 's arrival , the club did not enjoy an upturn in fortunes and have not won a league match since march , though he did keep them clear of last season 's relegation zone with a 12th-place finish . former assistant michael schjönberg was named interim coach until the club can find a long-term replacement capable of turning around hanover , who have n't won in their last 11 matches . the search could take awhile as rumors of other boardroom changes continue to swirl in hanover .
relegated kaiserslautern general manager rene c. jäggi is reported to be considering a move to hanover to help in the search for a new coach to help them meet their goal of being among the bundesliga 's top nine teams by the winter break . schjönberg , who neururer ordered off the training grounds in his last practice session as the team 's coach , will have a chance to make a case for himself sept .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts . " iranians will never give in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad again makes his point in iran , meanwhile , president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed saturday that his government would stand firm during any negotiations on its nuclear program , which tehran maintains it has a right to develop for atomic energy . " the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts . " iranians will never give in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad again makes his point in iran , meanwhile , president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed saturday that his government would stand firm during any negotiations on its nuclear program , which tehran maintains it has a right to develop for atomic energy . " the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland . " löw , 46 , took over when jürgen klinsmann quit after the world cup finals when germany finished a creditable third . lingering defensive problems germany start as favorites to win group d and to swat aside ireland but new manager löw has been in the job just over six weeks - far from the perfect preparation - and the new coach faces a defensive crisis . bildunterschrift : marcell jansen will be holding down the right defensive side " eveyone expects two wins from the next two matches but we have problems in defense with a lot of key players out , " germany captain michael ballack said . germany have lost robert huth , per mertesacker , christoph metzelder and jens nowotny to injury and ballack said the midfield need to shoulder the defensive burden . " torsten -lrb- frings -rrb- and i have a duty to help out the defense and provide some stability , " ballack said , adding that the team still intended to play the attacking soccer it did during the world cup . neither side expecting an easy match a 3-0 friendly win over sweden was a promising start for löw but he expects a much tougher game against ireland . " ireland will show typical british values , and i expect them to fight for everything and make it very tough for us , " löw added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw helped develop individual exercises for every player but at the very least the germans will be playing with comfortable feet .
the country 's soccer association reached a deal with adidas allowing players to wear the boots of their choice after some of germany 's most experienced players , including world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , had threatened to boycott the match . ireland failed to qualify for euro 2004 and this summer 's world cup and staunton has been entrusted with the task of making sure his homeland do not miss out again . " i never said it would be easy .
i am just at the start and know what we have to do to be successful , " said staunton .
" however i am optimistic we have enough good players to qualify for the european championships . " room for improvement staunton , 37 , hopes his team do just that and will expect a vast improvement on the 4-0 friendly hammering at home by the netherlands last time out . " it was embarrassing the dutch could have scored more goals , " admitted everton midfielder kevin kilbane . the last time ireland faced germany was in june 2002 when they played out a 1-1 draw in the world cup group stage .
a similar result would no doubt delight staunton . germany are the bookmakers ' favorites to win qualifying group d which contains ireland , the czech republic , slovakia , cyprus , wales and san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw on a high as germany trounce hapless swedes 3-0 germany retained their winning streak in new coach jogi löw 's first game by utterly dominating a woeful sweden side in gelsenkirchen on wednesday night .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts .

" the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland .

's bistro .
while one of them set fire to a napkin with a cigarette lighter , the other offered the owner private protection for the premises - naturally at a high price . this scene was not taking place in italy , the traditional territory for the mafia , but in germany .
like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .
this strategy means that victims are kept under control , while keeping police at bay . extortio n groups operati n g across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hospitality industry is a target for european extortion rackets according to an independent security advisor from the german town of krefeld , roland krichel , these extortion gangs operate especially in densely-populated areas like berlin , hamburg , the ruhr valley and the rhein-main region . krichel , a security consultant for businesses , is regularly approached by people working in the hospitality industry who are being blackmailed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2006 economy of fear : everyday occurances of extortion in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia-like organizations have been operating in germany no longer limited to the stereotyped italian mafia groups , money extortion is becoming more present in other european countries - including germany . one recent day , two men in leather jackets showed up at jörg k. 's bistro .
while one of them set fire to a napkin with a cigarette lighter , the other offered the owner private protection for the premises - naturally at a high price . this scene was not taking place in italy , the traditional territory for the mafia , but in germany .
like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .
this strategy means that victims are kept under control , while keeping police at bay . extortio n groups operati n g across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hospitality industry is a target for european extortion rackets according to an independent security advisor from the german town of krefeld , roland krichel , these extortion gangs operate especially in densely-populated areas like berlin , hamburg , the ruhr valley and the rhein-main region . krichel , a security consultant for businesses , is regularly approached by people working in the hospitality industry who are being blackmailed .
he said he has observed that the extortion gangs have divided up the territories amongst themselves . ' ' the main tool of extortion is fear , " krichel said .
' ' they attempt to engender fear and tell people , ' you do this , or something will happen , we 'll see that you business ca n't operate ' - usually through violence or bringing in the wrong kinds of guests . " this sends a clear signal while the extortionists remain safe from punishment by law enforcement agencies because they have not openly threatened or harmed anyone . blackmaili n g is difficult to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection money can bankrupt a business krichel said the police are unaware of the blackmailing , which means extortion activities have gone unnoticed and it is difficult to change the state of affairs , because it is almost impossible to prove there has been a crime . for example , a local business owner is compelled to hire a bouncer , for 100 euros -lrb- $ 128 -rrb- per hour or to regularly make generous contributions to a certain organization . the extorted money is camouflaged through contributions or a work contract so that can nothing be proved . the blackmailed person is quite anxious as the blackmailer can get angry if they find out that someone who they are extorting has broken their silence . he does not want to be named because his clients want him to remain anonyms . " extortion comes almost always with a milieu of other areas , " krichel said .
' ' those involved with blackmailing for protection money almost always are also involved with forced prostitution and exploitation as well . " payi n g protectio n mo n ey is a dow n ward spiral the head of the department for organized crime in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , roland wolff , warned anyone who is being blackmailed , against not getting help .
wolff said it can be a downward spiral that can quickly get out of control .
someone who pays protection money once will always have to do so .
this can eventually ruin a business . " businesses must then pay for permanent security … which can bring the business into the problematic situation of having to pay so much protection money , that then business is no longer profitable , " wolff said . but even if the person who is extorting is reported , it is difficult to prove that the blackmail is occurring .
it is rare to have legal proceedings and convictions for protection money extortions , as the feelings of anxiety for the person being blackmailed continue during the legal proceedings . anne passow -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new wave of mafia arrests in sicily in a crackdown following the seizure of a top mafia boss , italian officials arrested 45 suspects including clan leaders .

like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.09.2006 economy of fear : everyday occurances of extortion in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mafia-like organizations have been operating in germany no longer limited to the stereotyped italian mafia groups , money extortion is becoming more present in other european countries - including germany . one recent day , two men in leather jackets showed up at jörg k. 's bistro .
while one of them set fire to a napkin with a cigarette lighter , the other offered the owner private protection for the premises - naturally at a high price . this scene was not taking place in italy , the traditional territory for the mafia , but in germany .
like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .
this strategy means that victims are kept under control , while keeping police at bay . extortio n groups operati n g across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hospitality industry is a target for european extortion rackets according to an independent security advisor from the german town of krefeld , roland krichel , these extortion gangs operate especially in densely-populated areas like berlin , hamburg , the ruhr valley and the rhein-main region . krichel , a security consultant for businesses , is regularly approached by people working in the hospitality industry who are being blackmailed .
he said he has observed that the extortion gangs have divided up the territories amongst themselves . ' ' the main tool of extortion is fear , " krichel said .
' ' they attempt to engender fear and tell people , ' you do this , or something will happen , we 'll see that you business ca n't operate ' - usually through violence or bringing in the wrong kinds of guests . " this sends a clear signal while the extortionists remain safe from punishment by law enforcement agencies because they have not openly threatened or harmed anyone . blackmaili n g is difficult to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protection money can bankrupt a business krichel said the police are unaware of the blackmailing , which means extortion activities have gone unnoticed and it is difficult to change the state of affairs , because it is almost impossible to prove there has been a crime . for example , a local business owner is compelled to hire a bouncer , for 100 euros -lrb- $ 128 -rrb- per hour or to regularly make generous contributions to a certain organization . the extorted money is camouflaged through contributions or a work contract so that can nothing be proved . the blackmailed person is quite anxious as the blackmailer can get angry if they find out that someone who they are extorting has broken their silence . he does not want to be named because his clients want him to remain anonyms . " extortion comes almost always with a milieu of other areas , " krichel said .
' ' those involved with blackmailing for protection money almost always are also involved with forced prostitution and exploitation as well . " payi n g protectio n mo n ey is a dow n ward spiral the head of the department for organized crime in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , roland wolff , warned anyone who is being blackmailed , against not getting help .
wolff said it can be a downward spiral that can quickly get out of control .
someone who pays protection money once will always have to do so .
this can eventually ruin a business . " businesses must then pay for permanent security … which can bring the business into the problematic situation of having to pay so much protection money , that then business is no longer profitable , " wolff said . but even if the person who is extorting is reported , it is difficult to prove that the blackmail is occurring .

's bistro .
while one of them set fire to a napkin with a cigarette lighter , the other offered the owner private protection for the premises - naturally at a high price . this scene was not taking place in italy , the traditional territory for the mafia , but in germany .
like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .
this strategy means that victims are kept under control , while keeping police at bay . extortio n groups operati n g across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hospitality industry is a target for european extortion rackets according to an independent security advisor from the german town of krefeld , roland krichel , these extortion gangs operate especially in densely-populated areas like berlin , hamburg , the ruhr valley and the rhein-main region . krichel , a security consultant for businesses , is regularly approached by people working in the hospitality industry who are being blackmailed .
he said he has observed that the extortion gangs have divided up the territories amongst themselves . ' ' the main tool of extortion is fear , " krichel said .
' ' they attempt to engender fear and tell people , ' you do this , or something will happen , we 'll see that you business ca n't operate ' - usually through violence or bringing in the wrong kinds of guests .

" the deadline is tight .
his mandate is tight .
we need action .
we need a response from iran , " britain 's minister for european affairs , geoff hoon , told reporters after the eu talks in southern finland . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor that could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . solana 's talks with larijani are meant to " clarify " sections of a 21-page iranian response to an incentives deal , which also includes an offer to relaunch talks .
diplomats have suggested the text is , at best , unclear . eu chief looking for fast solution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers say there 's no deadline for new talks the eu 's top diplomat said he believes he will soon know if the iranians are serious , given the delaying tactics and gamesmanship widely employed by their representatives in its negotiations in the past . " we are going to start in the coming days and i hope it will be very short .
we do n't need many meetings , " solana told reporters in lappeenranta , southern finland , adding that : " there is no deadline . " the eu foreign ministers are due to meet again on sept .
15 to discuss developments , and solana said those talks would hinge on iran 's response but also the positions of the union 's international partners . " this is not a question of the eu only , this is a question of the eu , the us , russia , china ... there are other partners i have to deal with , " he said . focus on talks not sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of sanctions may scare iran off iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with tehran open without scaring it off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . britain , france and germany - who have been at the forefront of eu efforts to get iran to suspend its enrichment activities in exchange for a package of political and economic incentives - all warned that time was running out . " we do n't want to slam the door , but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . when france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , was asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " hoon issued a veiled threat about the use of sanctions . " it is important to emphasize that the security council process must carry on , " he said .
" we can not allow the iranians to continue to spin out this process the way they 've done in the past . " eu : no interest in escalation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to see iran move toward the negotiating table but steinmeier suggested that any moves in that direction at the united nations could be counter-productive . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " he said . spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts . " in iran , meanwhile , president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed saturday that his government would stand firm during any negotiations on its nuclear program , which tehran maintains it has a right to develop for atomic energy .

's bistro .
while one of them set fire to a napkin with a cigarette lighter , the other offered the owner private protection for the premises - naturally at a high price . this scene was not taking place in italy , the traditional territory for the mafia , but in germany .
like many organized crime groups throughout the world , which use blackmail to come into money quickly and maintain control over entire business sectors , mafia-style organizations are running large-scale protection rackets in germany , which operate by gangs spreading fear and demanding silence .
this strategy means that victims are kept under control , while keeping police at bay . extortio n groups operati n g across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hospitality industry is a target for european extortion rackets according to an independent security advisor from the german town of krefeld , roland krichel , these extortion gangs operate especially in densely-populated areas like berlin , hamburg , the ruhr valley and the rhein-main region . krichel , a security consultant for businesses , is regularly approached by people working in the hospitality industry who are being blackmailed .

" we do n't want to slam the door but we need a signal from iran that it is ready to move in our direction , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said ahead of a meeting of european union foreign ministers . iran ignored a un security council deadline thursday to suspend uranium enrichment - a process used to power a nuclear reactor but which could also be used to fuel an atomic bomb , which many fear tehran is trying to build . the united states has begun working toward sanctions , but since iran offered new talks on its nuclear program , veto-holding security council members russia and china appear to have softened their stance in tehran 's favor . eu 's solana takes diplomacy to iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign policy chief javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana will discuss iran 's offer next week with top iranian nuclear negotiator ari larijani , as the eu continues down the diplomatic road , even though it has had little effect so far . france 's minister for european affairs , catherine colonna , also warned that iran had very little time left to respond positively .
when asked by reporters how long iran would have she said : " see you in a few days . " iran 's offer of new talks has left the eu with a delicate diplomatic balancing act .
it must keep the door of dialogue with the islamic republic open without scaring tehran off by focusing too much on sanctions at the united nations . " the eu and germany have no interest in seeing an escalation in the coming days and weeks as a result of the consultations at the security council , " steinmeier said , in lappeenranta , southern finland . spanish foreign minister moratinos said that the eu was determined to " go right to the very end with dialogue , to the very end with its diplomatic efforts . " iranians will never give in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad again makes his point in iran , meanwhile , president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed saturday that his government would stand firm during any negotiations on its nuclear program , which tehran maintains it has a right to develop for atomic energy . " the people will not give in by one iota in their desire to use nuclear energy for peaceful ends and officials have the duty to defend these objectives with firmness during negotiations , " he said . but his country 's 21-page page offer is said by diplomats to be at best confusing and solana hopes to " clarify " its meaning during his talks with larijani at an undisclosed location in europe early next week . " i think it 's a little disappointing , " said dutch foreign minister ben bot .
" but we have to see how we can keep in contact because i think that 's very important . " " cutting off all contacts is the worst course for a politician so i keep hoping they will be as wise and as conciliatory as we are , " he said . solana , who was due to brief the ministers on iran before their informal talks end saturday , warned against any firm action on sanctions that might compromise his meeting next week . on friday , in a telling sign of the delicate state of affairs , he said : " i do n't want to talk about anything before that meeting that is not of a positive nature .

ireland , who are also premiering a new coach , will be his first opponent . " we have to forget the world cup and look forward .
our new target is to qualify for the european championships , but that goes without saying as far as i am concerned , " löw said .
" the project starts against ireland . " löw , 46 , took over when jürgen klinsmann quit after the world cup finals when germany finished a creditable third . lingering defensive problems germany start as favorites to win group d and to swat aside ireland but new manager löw has been in the job just over six weeks - far from the perfect preparation - and the new coach faces a defensive crisis . bildunterschrift : marcell jansen will be holding down the right defensive side " eveyone expects two wins from the next two matches but we have problems in defense with a lot of key players out , " germany captain michael ballack said . germany have lost robert huth , per mertesacker , christoph metzelder and jens nowotny to injury and ballack said the midfield need to shoulder the defensive burden . " torsten -lrb- frings -rrb- and i have a duty to help out the defense and provide some stability , " ballack said , adding that the team still intended to play the attacking soccer it did during the world cup . neither side expecting an easy match a 3-0 friendly win over sweden was a promising start for löw but he expects a much tougher game against ireland . " ireland will show typical british values , and i expect them to fight for everything and make it very tough for us , " löw added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw helped develop individual exercises for every player but at the very least the germans will be playing with comfortable feet .
the country 's soccer association reached a deal with adidas allowing players to wear the boots of their choice after some of germany 's most experienced players , including world cup golden boot winner miroslav klose , had threatened to boycott the match . ireland failed to qualify for euro 2004 and this summer 's world cup and staunton has been entrusted with the task of making sure his homeland do not miss out again . " i never said it would be easy .
i am just at the start and know what we have to do to be successful , " said staunton .
" however i am optimistic we have enough good players to qualify for the european championships . " room for improvement staunton , 37 , hopes his team do just that and will expect a vast improvement on the 4-0 friendly hammering at home by the netherlands last time out . " it was embarrassing the dutch could have scored more goals , " admitted everton midfielder kevin kilbane . the last time ireland faced germany was in june 2002 when they played out a 1-1 draw in the world cup group stage .
a similar result would no doubt delight staunton . germany are the bookmakers ' favorites to win qualifying group d which contains ireland , the czech republic , slovakia , cyprus , wales and san marino . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de löw on a high as germany trounce hapless swedes 3-0 germany retained their winning streak in new coach jogi löw 's first game by utterly dominating a woeful sweden side in gelsenkirchen on wednesday night .

he 's the 305th coach to leave a bundesliga team without finishing a contract in the history of the german league . hanover lost their opening three matches and saturday 's 3-0 defeat to alemannia aachen , who were recently promoted from the second division , nudged them to the bottom of the 18-strong table . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just one of the 11 goals hanover defenders watched hit the back of the net neururer took over the reins in november of last year , but despite the excitement of the 51-year-old 's arrival , the club did not enjoy an upturn in fortunes and have not won a league match since march , though he did keep them clear of last season 's relegation zone with a 12th-place finish . former assistant michael schjönberg was named interim coach until the club can find a long-term replacement capable of turning around hanover , who have n't won in their last 11 matches . the search could take awhile as rumors of other boardroom changes continue to swirl in hanover .
relegated kaiserslautern general manager rene c. jäggi is reported to be considering a move to hanover to help in the search for a new coach to help them meet their goal of being among the bundesliga 's top nine teams by the winter break . schjönberg , who neururer ordered off the training grounds in his last practice session as the team 's coach , will have a chance to make a case for himself sept .

professor john lovering has queried the 5,000 jobs figure at a hearing to determine the casino 's site , saying the true figure would be a few hundred .
but cardiff council stands by the figure and estimates £ 265m coming into the local economy each year .
leader rodney berman said the council was " confident " about its bid .
we were delighted that we made it onto the shortlist rodney berman , cardiff council leader discussions about possible jobs were heard at a casino advisory panel hearing , held in cardiff on friday .
cardiff council put forward their bid for a regional super-casino , which they say in an intrinsic part of the development of the international sports village .
the panel , headed by professor stephen crowe , is meeting at various venues around the uk .
it will choose one venue from a shortlist of cities including cardiff , blackpool , london and glasgow .
professor lovering , an expert in urban development at cardiff university , was one of a number of guests and representatives from organisations which gave their views to the panel .
during the hearing , he said : " that has been a certain degree of a lack of rigour or shall i say , sleight of hand , in terms of the figures on job creation . "
he added that the considerable muslim population of the grangetown ward , where the development would be located , would have nothing to do with the casino as gambling is forbidden by the koran .
acknowledging the muslim population 's aversion to gambling , the council 's corporate director tom morgan said he envisaged the casino development 's job creation would create vacancies in other sectors that they could fill .
he added : " cardiff is ready now . "
' opportunity ' cardiff council said it welcomed the opportunity to put its case at the hearing .
speaking after the meeting , mr berman said cardiff has an " outstanding track record " of delivering major regeneration projects such as the millennium stadium and the wales millennium centre .
he said : " the international sports village adds to all of this and will give cardiff the prestige and profile to continue to attract visitors from around the world .
" we were delighted that we made it onto the shortlist and welcome opportunities to highlight the unique case which we believe the city has made . "
cardiff council say their bid is tied to its sports village development in cardiff bay , and has said it needs the casino to finish the project in time for the 2012 london olympics , when it hopes to be a host venue .

the ceremony included live performances from peter kay , the zutons , duncan james and ronan keating , and was broadcast live on bbc radio 2 .
bolton comedian peter kay , who also performed at the show , had originally been tipped to turn on the lights .
a spokesman for the event said there had been some " confusion " over the line-up .
" there was some ambiguity about who was actually doing the switch-on , " he said . "
is n't blackpool fabulous ? "
dale winton " it was always dale winton doing the switch-on with a special appearance by peter kay . "
before switching on the lights , winton said : " is n't blackpool fabulous ?
" i love it .
i 'm having a great evening . "
he said the illuminations , which have been a regular attraction in the resort since 1879 , were " the best in the world " .
they shine non-stop for 66 nights every year .
peter kay took to the stage in front of blackpool tower to perform his famous " garlic bread " joke , recently voted best tv gag of all time .
