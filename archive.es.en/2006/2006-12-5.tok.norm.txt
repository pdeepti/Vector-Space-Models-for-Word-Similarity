31 , 2007 while those at airports must be lifted by march 30 , 2008 at the latest . currently , 15 countries are signatories to the schengen agreement , including the oldest eu members except britain and ireland , plus non-eu nations , norway and iceland . political motivations ? the schengen zone was established by treaty in 1985 and removes border posts and checks between eu member states and a common " schengen visa , " which allows access to all the signatory countries .
the treaty , however , does not cover residency or work permits for non-eu nationals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu countries such as switzerland also get access the 10 new , mainly eastern european nations in the 25-member bloc were told last year that their schengen entry , originally planned for 2007 , was in doubt due to technical delays with an update for the eu 's central visa information system . some newcomers , however , had said that the reasons were political rather than technical , charging old eu members of trying to block the eastern expansion of the border control-free zone . the new countries to join will include nine of the 10 countries that entered the eu in 2004 - cyprus will continue checking passports - plus switzerland , which is surrounded by eu countries but is not a member . secure borders necessary the 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 have all ratified the treaty , but have not yet implemented it .
they are estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , malta and cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions remain over incoming bulgaria and romania the move will only take place , however , if the countries ' external borders to the world outside the eu prove up to existing standards and when europe 's schengen database can be expanded to accommodate them .
germany and france had insisted that the new member states also prove their non-schengen frontiers are secure . under tuesday 's decision , the schengen hopefuls will temporarily be allowed to link into the old visa database until the new version is launched in june 2008 . costs for this interim solution are estimated at some 3.6 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . eu members will also have to take the formal decision to lift the borders , a move expected in the third quarter of 2007 . have you ever traveled inside the schengen states ?

31 , 2007 while those at airports must be lifted by march 30 , 2008 at the latest . currently , 15 countries are signatories to the schengen agreement , including the oldest eu members except britain and ireland , plus non-eu nations , norway and iceland . political motivations ? the schengen zone was established by treaty in 1985 and removes border posts and checks between eu member states and a common " schengen visa , " which allows access to all the signatory countries .
the treaty , however , does not cover residency or work permits for non-eu nationals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu countries such as switzerland also get access the 10 new , mainly eastern european nations in the 25-member bloc were told last year that their schengen entry , originally planned for 2007 , was in doubt due to technical delays with an update for the eu 's central visa information system . some newcomers , however , had said that the reasons were political rather than technical , charging old eu members of trying to block the eastern expansion of the border control-free zone . the new countries to join will include nine of the 10 countries that entered the eu in 2004 - cyprus will continue checking passports - plus switzerland , which is surrounded by eu countries but is not a member . secure borders necessary the 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 have all ratified the treaty , but have not yet implemented it .
they are estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , malta and cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions remain over incoming bulgaria and romania the move will only take place , however , if the countries ' external borders to the world outside the eu prove up to existing standards and when europe 's schengen database can be expanded to accommodate them .
germany and france had insisted that the new member states also prove their non-schengen frontiers are secure . under tuesday 's decision , the schengen hopefuls will temporarily be allowed to link into the old visa database until the new version is launched in june 2008 . costs for this interim solution are estimated at some 3.6 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . eu members will also have to take the formal decision to lift the borders , a move expected in the third quarter of 2007 . have you ever traveled inside the schengen states ?

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out .

" this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .

the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.12.2006 opinion : merely a polite exchange between germany and syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monday 's meeting in damascus between german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad was merely a formal exchange of opinions and admonitions , says deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . foreign minister steinmeier is one of the few european leaders who has sought contact with the syrian president bashar al-assad .
when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

" we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .
prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line . " our relations to turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion be closed , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt and estonian foreign minister urmas paet in comments published in the german daily die welt . both ministers said continuing membership talks with ankara was vital to insure that turkey continued its democratic reforms . bildt and paet underlined that the division of cyprus could only be resolved by working with the turkish government .
the island has been split since 1974 between the greek cypriot south , which is part of the eu , and the turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an eu boycott . " a reunification of cyprus will only be achieved if turkey is brought closer to the eu - otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division , " the ministers said . other countries onboard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski 's not happy about eu stance on turkey britain and italy are also part of the growing number of eu states opposed to an overly harsh stance on turkey . in addition , ankara 's allies in the united states have weighed into the debate .
us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burn said in brussels late monday that any move to close the door on turkish membership would be a major " strategic miscalculation . " the us envoy said the eu 's decision last year to open accession talks with turkey was one of the most important decisions made by europe at the beginning of the 21st century . " turkey is the bridge " between the west and islam , burn said of the predominantly muslim country . turkey warns of " historic mistake " in comments made in ankara , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also cautioned the eu against making a " historic mistake .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday .

spielberg 's shoah foundation institute for visual history and education this week granted berlin 's free university access to it for the first time . " history is not only comprised of numbers and facts but also the course of people 's lives and fates , " said fu president dieter lenzen .
" that is exactly what this archive documents . " " blood money " while the famous director was shooting his award-winning 1993 film " schindler 's list " in poland , he encountered numerous holocaust survivors who expressed a wish that their stories survive them for the generations to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg donated millions of his own to the project a year later , spielberg took what he calls " blood money , " the profits from the film , and created the shoah foundation , which began to document survivors ' testimony .
spielberg has injected about $ 65 million -lrb- 45 million euros -rrb- into the project . the bulk of the interviews are with survivors , mostly jews but also homosexuals , roma , jehovah 's witnesses and political prisoners .
others are with witnesses , liberators of the camps , members of aid organizations and people who testified at war crimes tribunals after world war ii . foundation wants broader audience although the shoah foundation made more than 1,000 interviews available to berlin 's jewish museum in 2004 , the agreement with the fu marks the first time that a non-us institution has received access to the entire archive .

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .

" that is exactly what this archive documents .

" the nine countries assessed are making progress towards convergence , though at different paces , " the european union 's executive arm concluded in a report . the study reviewed progress in the czech republic , estonia , cyprus , latvia , hungary , malta , poland , slovakia and sweden on meeting the economic and legal criteria necessary to adopt the euro . " although the road to the euro is proving more difficult than some may have thought originally , the reward is well worth the effort , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . the euro is the goal with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special eurozone opt-outs , all eu countries are supposed to make the euro their official currency .
sweden , however , voted against adopting the euro is a 2003 referendum and has since not renewed efforts to implement the shared currency . slovenia is to test the eurozone waters at the beginning of 2007 by becoming the first to adopt the single currency of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the european union in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are still out of reach of most new eu member states although none of the nine countries under review are reported to have met all of the criteria for joining , the two mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta had a chance of doing so next year . to be able to adopt the euro , candidates must hold inflation low , keep sound finances that meet eu limits , have a stable exchange rate and long-term interest rates as well as ensure their laws are in line with eu and european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- norms . tough challenges however , the inflation and public finances criteria are probably the most difficult to meet for most countries , with lithuania being refused earlier this year entry to the eurozone with slovenia because its inflation was too high . the commission found that the czech republic , cyprus , poland and sweden were the only countries reviewed that met the inflation criteria while estonia , cyprus , latvia and sweden met the public finances , with malta expected to do so next year . only estonia met the exchange rate criteria although malta and cyprus were also expected to make the grade next year while all the countries under review , with the exception of hungary , had long-term interests rates in line with the requirement . on legal requirements , estonia was the only country that had met eu and ecb norms although cyprus and malta were pushing through new laws that would help . lithuania was not included in the report because it was already reviewed earlier this year along with slovenia . getting " euro " right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least spell the name right if you 're going to spend them europe 's central bank also said on tuesday that countries aspiring to join the eurozone should get the spelling of the currency right . the ecb called it was unacceptable that latvia refers to the " eiro " and that hungary adds an acute accent to the " o . " " the euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it , " the ecb said .
" to make this singleness apparent , -lrb- eu -rrb- law requires a single spelling of the word ' euro ' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions . " if hungary and latvia do not step into line , they could be barred from joining the euro .
but the two countries face bigger challenges meeting eurozone standards on inflation and government borrowing . the ecb does allow greece to refer to the euro in its own alphabet , even putting the four greek letters on its banknotes . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .

german defense minister franz josef jung said some german soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina by may . german rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer on tuesday replaced italian general major marco chiarini at the helm of the eufor presence , which is securing stability in bosnia since the end of a bloody , three-year war that ended in 1995 . the 6,000-strong eufor replaced a nato-led peacekeeping presence in bosnia two years ago . the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , german defense minister franz josef jung and top bosnian officials attended the changing of command ceremony at the butmir airport , near sarajevo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer , now head of the eufor mission " you have contributed to the safe and secure environment in bosnia-herzegovina , " solana told the eufor mission , codenamed operation althea . solana added that he was expecting the situation to continue developing in the direction in which bosnia would in the future assume more responsibility , while the eu could reduce its presence . some german troops could pull out jung said earlier tuesday that perhaps 300 german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina in 2007 . he said that leaders at the european union summit next week would agree on a four-stage plan for the withdrawal of troops , with the first stage scheduled for may or june of next year . he added that the withdrawal would depend on the security situation in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's bosnian counterpart , nikola radovanovic , however , said eufor is still needed in bosnia-herzegovina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany the german association of college prep school teachers says that the number of scientology groups that operate tutoring centers has tripled in the past 10 years .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .

31 , 2007 while those at airports must be lifted by march 30 , 2008 at the latest . currently , 15 countries are signatories to the schengen agreement , including the oldest eu members except britain and ireland , plus non-eu nations , norway and iceland . political motivations ? the schengen zone was established by treaty in 1985 and removes border posts and checks between eu member states and a common " schengen visa , " which allows access to all the signatory countries .
the treaty , however , does not cover residency or work permits for non-eu nationals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu countries such as switzerland also get access the 10 new , mainly eastern european nations in the 25-member bloc were told last year that their schengen entry , originally planned for 2007 , was in doubt due to technical delays with an update for the eu 's central visa information system . some newcomers , however , had said that the reasons were political rather than technical , charging old eu members of trying to block the eastern expansion of the border control-free zone . the new countries to join will include nine of the 10 countries that entered the eu in 2004 - cyprus will continue checking passports - plus switzerland , which is surrounded by eu countries but is not a member . secure borders necessary the 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 have all ratified the treaty , but have not yet implemented it .
they are estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , malta and cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions remain over incoming bulgaria and romania the move will only take place , however , if the countries ' external borders to the world outside the eu prove up to existing standards and when europe 's schengen database can be expanded to accommodate them .
germany and france had insisted that the new member states also prove their non-schengen frontiers are secure . under tuesday 's decision , the schengen hopefuls will temporarily be allowed to link into the old visa database until the new version is launched in june 2008 . costs for this interim solution are estimated at some 3.6 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . eu members will also have to take the formal decision to lift the borders , a move expected in the third quarter of 2007 . have you ever traveled inside the schengen states ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.12.2006 german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers want to see more benefits and more euros in their pockets union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "

the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .
germany came third at the world cup on home soil this summer and wrestling the team away from adidas would be a major coup for nike . nike has contracts with other top teams led by five-time world cup winners brazil . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's a shoe fight and it 's not about manolo blahniks what do sarah jessica parker and the german national soccer team have in common ?

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line . " our relations to turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion be closed , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt and estonian foreign minister urmas paet in comments published in the german daily die welt . both ministers said continuing membership talks with ankara was vital to insure that turkey continued its democratic reforms . bildt and paet underlined that the division of cyprus could only be resolved by working with the turkish government .
the island has been split since 1974 between the greek cypriot south , which is part of the eu , and the turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an eu boycott . " a reunification of cyprus will only be achieved if turkey is brought closer to the eu - otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division , " the ministers said . other countries onboard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski 's not happy about eu stance on turkey britain and italy are also part of the growing number of eu states opposed to an overly harsh stance on turkey . in addition , ankara 's allies in the united states have weighed into the debate .
us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burn said in brussels late monday that any move to close the door on turkish membership would be a major " strategic miscalculation . " the us envoy said the eu 's decision last year to open accession talks with turkey was one of the most important decisions made by europe at the beginning of the 21st century . " turkey is the bridge " between the west and islam , burn said of the predominantly muslim country . turkey warns of " historic mistake " in comments made in ankara , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also cautioned the eu against making a " historic mistake . " " turkey is as important for the european union as the european union is for turkey , " said erdogan , who accused " certain right-wing " parties in europe of lacking vision . the turkish prime minister has said repeatedly that ankara would only move on the ports issue once an international embargo was lifted on northern turkish cyprus which voted in favor of a un-sponsored reunification plan for the island in 2004 . eu foreign ministers will try and clinch agreement on how to proceed with turkey in talks in brussels on dec .
11 . however , diplomats in brussels concede that given the high stakes in eu-turkey relations , eu leaders will also have to inevitably discuss the question . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany , poland call for equal partnership with russia the leaders of france , germany and poland on tuesday called for " an equal partnership " between russia and the eu , and for the resolution of a trade row between moscow and warsaw .
-lrb- 05.12.2006 -rrb- eu commission suggests halting part of turkish accession talks the european commission on wednesday called for a partial suspension of turkey 's negotiations towards european union membership after ankara refused to open its harbors and airports to greek cypriot ships and planes .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .

lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .

" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .

hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.12.2006 german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers want to see more benefits and more euros in their pockets union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .

" we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .
prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line . " our relations to turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion be closed , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt and estonian foreign minister urmas paet in comments published in the german daily die welt . both ministers said continuing membership talks with ankara was vital to insure that turkey continued its democratic reforms . bildt and paet underlined that the division of cyprus could only be resolved by working with the turkish government .
the island has been split since 1974 between the greek cypriot south , which is part of the eu , and the turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an eu boycott . " a reunification of cyprus will only be achieved if turkey is brought closer to the eu - otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division , " the ministers said . other countries onboard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski 's not happy about eu stance on turkey britain and italy are also part of the growing number of eu states opposed to an overly harsh stance on turkey . in addition , ankara 's allies in the united states have weighed into the debate .
us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burn said in brussels late monday that any move to close the door on turkish membership would be a major " strategic miscalculation . " the us envoy said the eu 's decision last year to open accession talks with turkey was one of the most important decisions made by europe at the beginning of the 21st century . " turkey is the bridge " between the west and islam , burn said of the predominantly muslim country . turkey warns of " historic mistake " in comments made in ankara , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also cautioned the eu against making a " historic mistake . " " turkey is as important for the european union as the european union is for turkey , " said erdogan , who accused " certain right-wing " parties in europe of lacking vision . the turkish prime minister has said repeatedly that ankara would only move on the ports issue once an international embargo was lifted on northern turkish cyprus which voted in favor of a un-sponsored reunification plan for the island in 2004 . eu foreign ministers will try and clinch agreement on how to proceed with turkey in talks in brussels on dec .
11 . however , diplomats in brussels concede that given the high stakes in eu-turkey relations , eu leaders will also have to inevitably discuss the question . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany , poland call for equal partnership with russia the leaders of france , germany and poland on tuesday called for " an equal partnership " between russia and the eu , and for the resolution of a trade row between moscow and warsaw .

german defense minister franz josef jung said some german soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina by may . german rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer on tuesday replaced italian general major marco chiarini at the helm of the eufor presence , which is securing stability in bosnia since the end of a bloody , three-year war that ended in 1995 . the 6,000-strong eufor replaced a nato-led peacekeeping presence in bosnia two years ago . the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , german defense minister franz josef jung and top bosnian officials attended the changing of command ceremony at the butmir airport , near sarajevo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer , now head of the eufor mission " you have contributed to the safe and secure environment in bosnia-herzegovina , " solana told the eufor mission , codenamed operation althea . solana added that he was expecting the situation to continue developing in the direction in which bosnia would in the future assume more responsibility , while the eu could reduce its presence . some german troops could pull out jung said earlier tuesday that perhaps 300 german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina in 2007 . he said that leaders at the european union summit next week would agree on a four-stage plan for the withdrawal of troops , with the first stage scheduled for may or june of next year . he added that the withdrawal would depend on the security situation in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's bosnian counterpart , nikola radovanovic , however , said eufor is still needed in bosnia-herzegovina .

german defense minister franz josef jung said some german soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina by may . german rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer on tuesday replaced italian general major marco chiarini at the helm of the eufor presence , which is securing stability in bosnia since the end of a bloody , three-year war that ended in 1995 . the 6,000-strong eufor replaced a nato-led peacekeeping presence in bosnia two years ago . the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , german defense minister franz josef jung and top bosnian officials attended the changing of command ceremony at the butmir airport , near sarajevo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer , now head of the eufor mission " you have contributed to the safe and secure environment in bosnia-herzegovina , " solana told the eufor mission , codenamed operation althea . solana added that he was expecting the situation to continue developing in the direction in which bosnia would in the future assume more responsibility , while the eu could reduce its presence . some german troops could pull out jung said earlier tuesday that perhaps 300 german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina in 2007 . he said that leaders at the european union summit next week would agree on a four-stage plan for the withdrawal of troops , with the first stage scheduled for may or june of next year . he added that the withdrawal would depend on the security situation in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's bosnian counterpart , nikola radovanovic , however , said eufor is still needed in bosnia-herzegovina . " the althea mission is very useful and still needed to this country , " he said .
" the time will come to talk about its ending , but our common goal is to make bosnia a stabile country . " the first significant reduction of the eufor troops currently deployed in bosnia could be expected in the first half of 2007 , radovanovic added . bosnia was torn by a ruthless 1992-1995 war among serbs , croats and the majority muslims that erupted following the disintegration of the federal yugoslavia . serbia borders bosnia-herzegovina , while kosovo , a southern serbian province seeking independence , has been administered by the united nations since the end of the war there in 1999 . the area is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the serbian government and kosovo 's albanian population .
a solution on the territory 's final status has been postponed until after parliamentary elections in serbia on jan .

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .

the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .
germany came third at the world cup on home soil this summer and wrestling the team away from adidas would be a major coup for nike . nike has contracts with other top teams led by five-time world cup winners brazil . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's a shoe fight and it 's not about manolo blahniks what do sarah jessica parker and the german national soccer team have in common ?
their love of shoes , of course .

-lrb- 09.05.2006 -rrb- adidas cashes in on the world cup german sports giant adidas is using its dominance in the soccer gear business during the upcoming world cup to kit out the german national team as well as five others .
and that 's not where its magic marketing arm ends .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .
germany came third at the world cup on home soil this summer and wrestling the team away from adidas would be a major coup for nike . nike has contracts with other top teams led by five-time world cup winners brazil . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's a shoe fight and it 's not about manolo blahniks what do sarah jessica parker and the german national soccer team have in common ?

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .
germany came third at the world cup on home soil this summer and wrestling the team away from adidas would be a major coup for nike . nike has contracts with other top teams led by five-time world cup winners brazil . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's a shoe fight and it 's not about manolo blahniks what do sarah jessica parker and the german national soccer team have in common ?

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.12.2006 germany supports caps on airline carbon dioxide emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is backing the regulation of airline emissions by the eu the german government supported eu plans to introduce binding climate protection guidelines for airlines and said it would address the issue after taking over the eu presidency next year . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said in a newspaper interview tuesday that berlin 's aim was to secure fundamental agreement on the issue among eu member states during germany 's six-month eu presidency , which starts in january . " we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .
prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates .

" we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .
prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

" the chancellor 's proposal is that the european commission should set a deadline of 18 months to review this issue " before deciding whether to resume full membership talks with turkey , said deputy government spokesman thomas steg .
" she believes that this could prove an appropriate and sensible instrument . " steg said that the proposal , which had been mooted at the recent nato summit in riga , would be discussed by merkel and chirac when they meet in mettlach in western germany on tuesday . according to a financial times report , chirac plans to back merkel 's proposal .

the measure will see that eight of the 35 policy chapters , which all candidate nations must complete , remain closed . a deadline for resuming full talks does not form part of the proposal so far but officials have told the press that both france and germany believe it is necessary to maintain pressure on ankara . poland 's invited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with kacynski in berlin in march merkel and chirac are meeting for their customary bi-monthly informal talks , which will be followed by a three-way summit with polish president lech kaczynski . steg said the mettlach meeting would provide an opportunity for the leaders to discuss issues relating to the " further development of europe , including how we should now negotiate further with turkey .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line . " our relations to turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion be closed , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt and estonian foreign minister urmas paet in comments published in the german daily die welt . both ministers said continuing membership talks with ankara was vital to insure that turkey continued its democratic reforms . bildt and paet underlined that the division of cyprus could only be resolved by working with the turkish government .
the island has been split since 1974 between the greek cypriot south , which is part of the eu , and the turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an eu boycott . " a reunification of cyprus will only be achieved if turkey is brought closer to the eu - otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division , " the ministers said . other countries onboard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski 's not happy about eu stance on turkey britain and italy are also part of the growing number of eu states opposed to an overly harsh stance on turkey . in addition , ankara 's allies in the united states have weighed into the debate .
us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burn said in brussels late monday that any move to close the door on turkish membership would be a major " strategic miscalculation . " the us envoy said the eu 's decision last year to open accession talks with turkey was one of the most important decisions made by europe at the beginning of the 21st century . " turkey is the bridge " between the west and islam , burn said of the predominantly muslim country . turkey warns of " historic mistake " in comments made in ankara , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also cautioned the eu against making a " historic mistake . " " turkey is as important for the european union as the european union is for turkey , " said erdogan , who accused " certain right-wing " parties in europe of lacking vision . the turkish prime minister has said repeatedly that ankara would only move on the ports issue once an international embargo was lifted on northern turkish cyprus which voted in favor of a un-sponsored reunification plan for the island in 2004 . eu foreign ministers will try and clinch agreement on how to proceed with turkey in talks in brussels on dec .

" the nine countries assessed are making progress towards convergence , though at different paces , " the european union 's executive arm concluded in a report . the study reviewed progress in the czech republic , estonia , cyprus , latvia , hungary , malta , poland , slovakia and sweden on meeting the economic and legal criteria necessary to adopt the euro . " although the road to the euro is proving more difficult than some may have thought originally , the reward is well worth the effort , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . the euro is the goal with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special eurozone opt-outs , all eu countries are supposed to make the euro their official currency .
sweden , however , voted against adopting the euro is a 2003 referendum and has since not renewed efforts to implement the shared currency . slovenia is to test the eurozone waters at the beginning of 2007 by becoming the first to adopt the single currency of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the european union in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are still out of reach of most new eu member states although none of the nine countries under review are reported to have met all of the criteria for joining , the two mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta had a chance of doing so next year . to be able to adopt the euro , candidates must hold inflation low , keep sound finances that meet eu limits , have a stable exchange rate and long-term interest rates as well as ensure their laws are in line with eu and european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- norms . tough challenges however , the inflation and public finances criteria are probably the most difficult to meet for most countries , with lithuania being refused earlier this year entry to the eurozone with slovenia because its inflation was too high . the commission found that the czech republic , cyprus , poland and sweden were the only countries reviewed that met the inflation criteria while estonia , cyprus , latvia and sweden met the public finances , with malta expected to do so next year . only estonia met the exchange rate criteria although malta and cyprus were also expected to make the grade next year while all the countries under review , with the exception of hungary , had long-term interests rates in line with the requirement . on legal requirements , estonia was the only country that had met eu and ecb norms although cyprus and malta were pushing through new laws that would help . lithuania was not included in the report because it was already reviewed earlier this year along with slovenia . getting " euro " right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least spell the name right if you 're going to spend them europe 's central bank also said on tuesday that countries aspiring to join the eurozone should get the spelling of the currency right . the ecb called it was unacceptable that latvia refers to the " eiro " and that hungary adds an acute accent to the " o . " " the euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it , " the ecb said .
" to make this singleness apparent , -lrb- eu -rrb- law requires a single spelling of the word ' euro ' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions . " if hungary and latvia do not step into line , they could be barred from joining the euro .
but the two countries face bigger challenges meeting eurozone standards on inflation and government borrowing . the ecb does allow greece to refer to the euro in its own alphabet , even putting the four greek letters on its banknotes . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .
-lrb- 16.05.2006 -rrb- opinion : burying the euro stability pact eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency .
-lrb- 22.03.2005 -rrb- does europe need stability or flexibility ?
german chancellor gerhard schröder is pushing for a looser interpretation of the eu budgetary rules designed to protect the euro .
a revamp of the stability pact looks likely , but will that hurt or help europe 's economy ? -lrb- 25.01.2005 -rrb- feedback should countries be able to write " euro " as they please ?

" our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.12.2006 german economic boom leads to calls for higher wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers want to see more benefits and more euros in their pockets union leaders and some politicians are calling for substantial wage increases because of unexpected growth rates this year .
but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .

spielberg 's shoah foundation institute for visual history and education this week granted berlin 's free university access to it for the first time . " history is not only comprised of numbers and facts but also the course of people 's lives and fates , " said fu president dieter lenzen .
" that is exactly what this archive documents . " " blood money " while the famous director was shooting his award-winning 1993 film " schindler 's list " in poland , he encountered numerous holocaust survivors who expressed a wish that their stories survive them for the generations to come . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spielberg donated millions of his own to the project a year later , spielberg took what he calls " blood money , " the profits from the film , and created the shoah foundation , which began to document survivors ' testimony .
spielberg has injected about $ 65 million -lrb- 45 million euros -rrb- into the project . the bulk of the interviews are with survivors , mostly jews but also homosexuals , roma , jehovah 's witnesses and political prisoners .
others are with witnesses , liberators of the camps , members of aid organizations and people who testified at war crimes tribunals after world war ii . foundation wants broader audience although the shoah foundation made more than 1,000 interviews available to berlin 's jewish museum in 2004 , the agreement with the fu marks the first time that a non-us institution has received access to the entire archive .
so far , four american universities have access . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the video archive is a living memorial to the holocaust douglas greenberg , director of the shoah foundation institute for visual history and education , said one of the organization 's most important goals was to provide access to the archive to as broad an audience as possible . as result , students , teachers and researchers will have direct online access to the information stored in the data bank of the california university . already , the project is producing spin-offs .
yehuda bauer , a respected israeli historian is writing a new book on six european jewish communities that were erased during the holocaust .

" the nine countries assessed are making progress towards convergence , though at different paces , " the european union 's executive arm concluded in a report . the study reviewed progress in the czech republic , estonia , cyprus , latvia , hungary , malta , poland , slovakia and sweden on meeting the economic and legal criteria necessary to adopt the euro . " although the road to the euro is proving more difficult than some may have thought originally , the reward is well worth the effort , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . the euro is the goal with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special eurozone opt-outs , all eu countries are supposed to make the euro their official currency .
sweden , however , voted against adopting the euro is a 2003 referendum and has since not renewed efforts to implement the shared currency . slovenia is to test the eurozone waters at the beginning of 2007 by becoming the first to adopt the single currency of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the european union in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are still out of reach of most new eu member states although none of the nine countries under review are reported to have met all of the criteria for joining , the two mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta had a chance of doing so next year . to be able to adopt the euro , candidates must hold inflation low , keep sound finances that meet eu limits , have a stable exchange rate and long-term interest rates as well as ensure their laws are in line with eu and european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- norms . tough challenges however , the inflation and public finances criteria are probably the most difficult to meet for most countries , with lithuania being refused earlier this year entry to the eurozone with slovenia because its inflation was too high . the commission found that the czech republic , cyprus , poland and sweden were the only countries reviewed that met the inflation criteria while estonia , cyprus , latvia and sweden met the public finances , with malta expected to do so next year . only estonia met the exchange rate criteria although malta and cyprus were also expected to make the grade next year while all the countries under review , with the exception of hungary , had long-term interests rates in line with the requirement . on legal requirements , estonia was the only country that had met eu and ecb norms although cyprus and malta were pushing through new laws that would help . lithuania was not included in the report because it was already reviewed earlier this year along with slovenia . getting " euro " right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least spell the name right if you 're going to spend them europe 's central bank also said on tuesday that countries aspiring to join the eurozone should get the spelling of the currency right . the ecb called it was unacceptable that latvia refers to the " eiro " and that hungary adds an acute accent to the " o . " " the euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it , " the ecb said .
" to make this singleness apparent , -lrb- eu -rrb- law requires a single spelling of the word ' euro ' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions . " if hungary and latvia do not step into line , they could be barred from joining the euro .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line . " our relations to turkey should be neither frozen nor should any doors for further -lrb- eu -rrb- expansion be closed , " said swedish foreign minister carl bildt and estonian foreign minister urmas paet in comments published in the german daily die welt . both ministers said continuing membership talks with ankara was vital to insure that turkey continued its democratic reforms . bildt and paet underlined that the division of cyprus could only be resolved by working with the turkish government .
the island has been split since 1974 between the greek cypriot south , which is part of the eu , and the turkish north which is not recognized and subject to an eu boycott . " a reunification of cyprus will only be achieved if turkey is brought closer to the eu - otherwise there is the apparent risk of a permanent division , " the ministers said . other countries onboard bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president lech kaczynski 's not happy about eu stance on turkey britain and italy are also part of the growing number of eu states opposed to an overly harsh stance on turkey . in addition , ankara 's allies in the united states have weighed into the debate .
us undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burn said in brussels late monday that any move to close the door on turkish membership would be a major " strategic miscalculation . " the us envoy said the eu 's decision last year to open accession talks with turkey was one of the most important decisions made by europe at the beginning of the 21st century . " turkey is the bridge " between the west and islam , burn said of the predominantly muslim country . turkey warns of " historic mistake " in comments made in ankara , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan also cautioned the eu against making a " historic mistake . " " turkey is as important for the european union as the european union is for turkey , " said erdogan , who accused " certain right-wing " parties in europe of lacking vision . the turkish prime minister has said repeatedly that ankara would only move on the ports issue once an international embargo was lifted on northern turkish cyprus which voted in favor of a un-sponsored reunification plan for the island in 2004 . eu foreign ministers will try and clinch agreement on how to proceed with turkey in talks in brussels on dec .

" we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .
prices for long-haul flight could increase by about nine euros -lrb- $ 12 -rrb- , according to eu commission estimates . while not rejecting the emissions trading plan outright , officials from lufthansa said investments in more modern aircraft would be more beneficial to the environment . flights not part of kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries must comply with kyoto , but not airlines international air traffic is not currently part of the kyoto protocol on climate change , though tiefensee said an international solution that treated airlines equally needed to be found . " competition difficulties can not be allowed to occur because some nations do not take part in the emissions trading , " tiefensee told the handelsblatt , adding that finding a compromise should be possible .
" in principle there is no disagreement in europe that air traffic has to be included in emissions trading . " in the initial allocation of emission rights , the eu said it wants to base credits on an airline 's average co2 output from 2004 to 2006 . dw staff -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de commission cracks down on eu carbon credit give away on wednesday , the european commission demanded from some eu counties , including germany , to cut carbon credit permits for 2008-2012 , under its european trading scheme -lrb- ets -rrb- , after over-supplying emission rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.12.2006 opinion : merely a polite exchange between germany and syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monday 's meeting in damascus between german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad was merely a formal exchange of opinions and admonitions , says deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . foreign minister steinmeier is one of the few european leaders who has sought contact with the syrian president bashar al-assad .
when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .

any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .
instead , it was wrought with a unilateral view that focused entirely on syria 's own interests .
if syria maintains this stance , there will no second visit to damascus . nina werkhäuser is dw-radio 's foreign affairs correspondent in berlin -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de assad blames israel for tensions as steinmeier pushes for peace german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier met with president assad in damascus and urged the syrian leader to engage in the peace process .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .
" but we should also be concerned about those companies where business remains sluggish and which can not cope with huge wage increases . " taxes endanger jobs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raised vat is expected to dampen consumption members of merkel 's christian democratic union supported diversified wage demands .
but dirk niebel , general secretary of germany 's free-market liberal opposition party , the free democrats , said the government should stop hitting people with higher taxes . " this means first of all doing away with the planned increase in value-added-tax that will endanger thousands of jobs next year , " he said .
" secondly , contributions to the social systems must come down , and people must be given back most of what the government has taken away from them in the past . "
economists also attribute the current spending spree to fear of the 3 percent increase in value-added-tax to be introduced jan .
1 .
the increase is expected to dampen consumption from 0.8 percent this year to 0.3 percent in 2007 .
while economists admitted that wages in germany dropped substantially over the past five years in real terms , higher wages and price hikes as a result of higher vat are a recipe for inflation and rising interest rates , they say . the european central bank has already said it will be closely watching developments in germany because exorbitant increases in german wages , ecb analysts warn , could also produce higher inflation and rising interest rates in the 25-member eu . uwe hessler -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany in " sustainable recovery " consumer polls and expert forecasts paint a rosy picture for the german economy .

" the nine countries assessed are making progress towards convergence , though at different paces , " the european union 's executive arm concluded in a report . the study reviewed progress in the czech republic , estonia , cyprus , latvia , hungary , malta , poland , slovakia and sweden on meeting the economic and legal criteria necessary to adopt the euro . " although the road to the euro is proving more difficult than some may have thought originally , the reward is well worth the effort , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia . the euro is the goal with the exception of britain and denmark , which have special eurozone opt-outs , all eu countries are supposed to make the euro their official currency .
sweden , however , voted against adopting the euro is a 2003 referendum and has since not renewed efforts to implement the shared currency . slovenia is to test the eurozone waters at the beginning of 2007 by becoming the first to adopt the single currency of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the european union in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are still out of reach of most new eu member states although none of the nine countries under review are reported to have met all of the criteria for joining , the two mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta had a chance of doing so next year . to be able to adopt the euro , candidates must hold inflation low , keep sound finances that meet eu limits , have a stable exchange rate and long-term interest rates as well as ensure their laws are in line with eu and european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- norms . tough challenges however , the inflation and public finances criteria are probably the most difficult to meet for most countries , with lithuania being refused earlier this year entry to the eurozone with slovenia because its inflation was too high . the commission found that the czech republic , cyprus , poland and sweden were the only countries reviewed that met the inflation criteria while estonia , cyprus , latvia and sweden met the public finances , with malta expected to do so next year . only estonia met the exchange rate criteria although malta and cyprus were also expected to make the grade next year while all the countries under review , with the exception of hungary , had long-term interests rates in line with the requirement . on legal requirements , estonia was the only country that had met eu and ecb norms although cyprus and malta were pushing through new laws that would help . lithuania was not included in the report because it was already reviewed earlier this year along with slovenia . getting " euro " right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least spell the name right if you 're going to spend them europe 's central bank also said on tuesday that countries aspiring to join the eurozone should get the spelling of the currency right . the ecb called it was unacceptable that latvia refers to the " eiro " and that hungary adds an acute accent to the " o . " " the euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it , " the ecb said .
" to make this singleness apparent , -lrb- eu -rrb- law requires a single spelling of the word ' euro ' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions . " if hungary and latvia do not step into line , they could be barred from joining the euro .
but the two countries face bigger challenges meeting eurozone standards on inflation and government borrowing . the ecb does allow greece to refer to the euro in its own alphabet , even putting the four greek letters on its banknotes . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

german defense minister franz josef jung said some german soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina by may . german rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer on tuesday replaced italian general major marco chiarini at the helm of the eufor presence , which is securing stability in bosnia since the end of a bloody , three-year war that ended in 1995 . the 6,000-strong eufor replaced a nato-led peacekeeping presence in bosnia two years ago . the eu 's top diplomat , javier solana , german defense minister franz josef jung and top bosnian officials attended the changing of command ceremony at the butmir airport , near sarajevo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rear admiral hans-jochen witthauer , now head of the eufor mission " you have contributed to the safe and secure environment in bosnia-herzegovina , " solana told the eufor mission , codenamed operation althea . solana added that he was expecting the situation to continue developing in the direction in which bosnia would in the future assume more responsibility , while the eu could reduce its presence . some german troops could pull out jung said earlier tuesday that perhaps 300 german armed forces -lrb- bundeswehr -rrb- soldiers could leave bosnia-herzegovina in 2007 . he said that leaders at the european union summit next week would agree on a four-stage plan for the withdrawal of troops , with the first stage scheduled for may or june of next year . he added that the withdrawal would depend on the security situation in kosovo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung 's bosnian counterpart , nikola radovanovic , however , said eufor is still needed in bosnia-herzegovina . " the althea mission is very useful and still needed to this country , " he said .
" the time will come to talk about its ending , but our common goal is to make bosnia a stabile country . " the first significant reduction of the eufor troops currently deployed in bosnia could be expected in the first half of 2007 , radovanovic added . bosnia was torn by a ruthless 1992-1995 war among serbs , croats and the majority muslims that erupted following the disintegration of the federal yugoslavia . serbia borders bosnia-herzegovina , while kosovo , a southern serbian province seeking independence , has been administered by the united nations since the end of the war there in 1999 . the area is the subject of a long-running political and territorial dispute between the serbian government and kosovo 's albanian population .

but employers and bankers said increases will have a dampening effect on the economy . germany 's shops and christmas markets are filling with shoppers and the pre-christmas buying boom is accompanied by new , liberalized shopping hours in many parts of country , which allow stores to stay open later and even on sundays in hope of convincing more people to open their wallets . this is one sign of the economic boom in germany , which has recently experienced growth rates topping the 2 percent previously expected this year .
as a result , many say that benefits from this should now trickle down to workers . " decent wage increases would mean that people 's purchasing power eventually catches up with economic growth , " said kurt beck , leader of the social democrats , who share power in germany 's grand coalition government with chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives .
" this has n't been possible in recent years but becomes even more important with respect to our efforts to shore up domestic consumption and growth . " as a result , senior social democratic party figures have come out in support of trade union demands for higher wages , arguing that years of wage restraint should come to an end . employers reluctant to increase wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even germany 's lagging construction industry has been growing meanwhile , wage negotiations in some pivotal sectors of the economy are due to start soon and bargaining is expected to be fierce .
for example , german engineering and metalworkers represented by ig metall are demanding an increase of up to 7 percent in wage talks due to begin next year . in the past , workers had accepted job security assurances instead of wage hikes .
many german companies have used such agreements as breathing space to restructure operations and cut costs and are now profitable again especially because of global economic expansion .
because of that profitability , a wage increase of between 5 percent and 7 percent would be appropriate , ig metall 's northern chapter head , jutta blankau , told welt am sonntag weekly newspaper .
" it 's true that unions have been exercising a certain amount of restraint , " she said .
" with stiff competition and industry costs remaining high , unions had no choice .
but that is changing . "
still , the european central bank has already warned of inflationary pressure should wages go up too steeply .
and german employers are reluctant too , fearing that wage hikes will lead to a decreased competitiveness of their goods and services . martin kannegiesser , chief negotiator for the employers in the metalworking industry , said he does n't favor the idea of wage hikes but is n't willing to rule them out . " in companies where business is booming , wages could indeed rise , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.12.2006 opinion : merely a polite exchange between germany and syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monday 's meeting in damascus between german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and syrian president bashar al-assad was merely a formal exchange of opinions and admonitions , says deutsche welle 's nina werkhäuser . foreign minister steinmeier is one of the few european leaders who has sought contact with the syrian president bashar al-assad .
when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .

when he landed in damascus , he was primarily toting one thing : a message from the lebanese government .
steinmeier urged the syrian president to stop getting involved in lebanon 's affairs and to remain at bay from the current hezbollah demonstrations in beirut . so far , so good : the fear that chaos , violence and instability could break out in lebanon is justified .
but other than the appeals concerning lebanon , and a few more of his own regarding the palestinian territories thrown in , steinmeier did n't take along much else to damascus .
he also did not take much with him when he departed syria . great expectations all the same , he did travel there himself , which is more than most other european leaders would do .
that raised high expectations .
excitement was also high since steinmeier had canceled his visit there in august at the last minute - due to verbal fallout from president assad .
in diplomatic circles , that cancellation prompted reactions on par with those following the cancellation of a nasa rocket launch .
the situation quickly became extremely tense . the more profound reason for steinmeier 's precarious mission was difficult to detect .
from the start , it was not to be expected that syria would be impressed by the german foreign minister 's visit , much less be influenced by it .
then there was the unease among the governments in beirut and tel aviv about steinmeier 's travel plans , and the danger that syria could cannibalize the events and use them for propaganda . invisible links the ties between damascus , beirut , teheran , hezbollah and hamas are nearly invisible to outsiders - and they run along lines of mutual dependency right through syria .
they lend a completely different view about the conflicts in the region than the german government has on the issues .
that is no reason not to meet up and talk , but it is a reason why the various sides may not see eye to eye . that is precisely how the visit in damascus went .
it was a polite exchange of opinions and admonitions between steinmeier and assad that will not lead them to follow the same path .
unless , of course , the german government gets the chance to have a positive effect on the middle east conflict when it takes up the european union presidency in january . down the line then , it could be advantageous to have met with the syrian president personally and established contact with him .
any further interpretations into the strategic finesse of german foreign diplomacy concerning this trip would be going too far . perhaps the effect of steinmeier 's visit to damascus lies merely in that he sent signals to the government in damascus and relayed some opinions that are very unpopular in syria .
the syrian foreign minister 's rhetoric following steinmeier 's talk with assad , at any rate , did not show that he had pondered some of the german foreign minister 's thoughts .

finland , sweden , estonia and poland want doors open . representing eu hardliners , german chancellor angela merkel and french president jacques chirac are meeting in mettlach , germany , to demand stronger action against ankara for refusing to open its ports to greek cypriot vessels . both leaders said last week 's proposals by the european commission for a partial suspension of turkish accession talks needs to be toughened up by introducing a " review clause " allowing any eu state to veto a resumption of negotiations with ankara . " our goal is that the ankara protocol -lrb- on regular trade with the 10 new eu members -rrb- will be implemented , " she told reporters .
" we do n't want to set any kind of ultimatum . " merkel , who opposes turkey 's full entry to the eu but supports offering the country a " privileged partnership , " has said a vote should only take place after an 18-month waiting period . differing opinions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel made her views on turkish eu membership clear during a visit in may however , in comments made to the european parliament , finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency , said he favored the commission 's call for a partial freeze in talks . vanhanen said the commission 's stance provided a " good basis for a decision " on turkey when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels next monday . the commission - the eu 's executive agency - is urging the bloc 's governments to put negotiations on ice for eight of 35 policy areas covered in the talks because of turkey 's non-compliance with eu demands . the finnish premier also insisted that he wanted discussions on turkey to be kept off the agenda of the eu summit in brussels on dec.14 and 15 . while admitting ties with ankara were difficult at the moment , vanhanen said plans for opening the european club to turkey should be kept on track . open door ties between poland and eu heavyweights france and germany were strained further when polish president lech kaczynski contradicted the franco-german view on turkish accession at a summit on tuesday . " poland is of the view that membership talks with turkey should continue , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister finnish prime minister vanhanen -lrb- l -rrb- met with turkish pm erdogan last week the foreign ministers of estonia and sweden have also cold-shouldered merkel and chirac 's tough line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.12.2006 germany supports caps on airline carbon dioxide emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is backing the regulation of airline emissions by the eu the german government supported eu plans to introduce binding climate protection guidelines for airlines and said it would address the issue after taking over the eu presidency next year . transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said in a newspaper interview tuesday that berlin 's aim was to secure fundamental agreement on the issue among eu member states during germany 's six-month eu presidency , which starts in january . " we want to make progress on the eu commission 's plans to extend emissions trading to air traffic , " tiefensee told the business daily handelsblatt . on dec .
20 , eu environment commissioner stavros dimas is scheduled to present draft guidelines that include airlines in the emissions trading system , which currently applies to power generators and energy-intensive industries . eu airline emissions plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa officials did not rule out a global emissions trading program according to the report in handesblatt , dimas will propose that by 2011 all airlines produce a so-called co2 certificate , for flights within europe as well as for intercontinental flights that take off or land in the eu . the proposal does , however , make an exception for military flights and planes with fewer than 20 seats or 20 tons start-weight . each airline would be provided with a certain number of emissions rights and would be forced to buy in additional certificates from companies that undershoot their pollution targets if they exceed their emissions allowance . the current system of emissions trading in the eu only sets industrial caps and is mainly concerned with large co2 emissions , as well as power plants and oil refineries . airlines involved are skeptical of the approach and said the trading program could lead to increases in ticket fares .

it would be the end of a marriage that began with 1954 's miracle of bern .
the relationship between the german soccer federation and sports firm adidas is now in danger due to a flirtatious approach by us giant nike . jürgen klinsmann , world cup mascot goleo , the national soccer team ...
is there anything the americans are not prepared to take off germany 's hands ? while former german team coach klinsi remains cagey about his courtship with the us soccer federation and the strategic value partners investment group gets ready to save bankrupt german toymaker nici , global sportswear giant nike is lining up another audacious swoop . the german national soccer team has long been associated with the country 's premier sports brand adidas .
in fact , the company founded by adi dassler pioneered the link between sports firms and teams .
the german team has always had their equipment designed and provided by adidas - but all that could change if nike gets its way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earning his stripes : germany skipper ballack in adidas scenting blood in the air , the american firm is circling the current deal between the german soccer federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- and its incumbent supplier .
adidas says that it has an agreement with the dfb to renew its current contract until 2014 , but the dfb maintains that while negotiations are continuing , no deal has been done . nike deal worth 400 million euros with the contract with the dfb apparently open , nike has slapped a 50 million euros -lrb- $ 66.7 million -rrb- per year offer on the table to become the german national team equipment company .
the nike deal , which would be spread over eight years beginning in 2011 , would net the dfb some 400 million euros . " you ca n't ignore it , " werner hackmann , vice-president of the dfb and chairman of the german soccer league , said on sunday .
" it is a lot of money which soccer could use very well . " the figure is five times higher than the 10-11 million euros the dfb currently receives from long-time partners adidas . while the money is intoxicating , the dfb may use the nike deal to put pressure on adidas to come up with its own improved offer .
recent events have shown that just being german and having a long relationship with the dfb is no guarantee for a renewed contract . the german company 's negotiating positioned was weakened in the summer when the germany players forced an agreement in which they could chose their own soccer boots instead of being restricted to those provided by adidas . us firm hope germany joins brazil on team roster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rivals germany and brazil could become brand buddies the german national team is one of the top sides in the world , with three world cup titles and three european championship wins .
germany came third at the world cup on home soil this summer and wrestling the team away from adidas would be a major coup for nike . nike has contracts with other top teams led by five-time world cup winners brazil . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de it 's a shoe fight and it 's not about manolo blahniks what do sarah jessica parker and the german national soccer team have in common ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.12.2006 german court considers investigation into student death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah duggan was 22 when he died jeremiah duggan was a young british student who met a mysterious death in germany in 2003 .
the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .

the constitutional court is currently considering whether to order a new investigation into what happened . in the early hours of march 27 , 2003 , the body of a young man was found on the b455 freeway outside wiesbaden .
after questioning motorists , local police concluded jeremiah duggan had committed suicide by running into traffic , and the case was closed .
but in the last three and a half years , jeremiah 's mother has amassed evidence which she says proves her son did not take his own life - and also suggests that the perfunctory police investigation was badly flawed .
even so , despite the fact that the coroner at the british inquest in november 2003 said there was nothing in the german police evidence to suggest jeremiah 's death could be suicide , german courts have refused to reopen the case .
" the police investigation was incomplete , " argues erica duggan 's lawyer hans-eberhard schultz .
" no autopsy was performed on the body , and no witness statements were taken from the drivers of the cars .
at the very least , these people need to be questioned again thoroughly . "
erica duggan is haunted by questions no one seems willing to help her answer .
" why does n't germany want to investigate the full circumstances of his death ? " she asks .
a search for clues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jeremiah was described by friends as a happy , well-balanced young man one report she commissioned from former scotland yard forensics expert paul canning earlier this year suggests that nothing less than a cover-up may have taken place .
according to his findings , the tracks on the road did not match the police version of how the accident happened , and there were no signs of glass , tire marks or crushing of the body to prove it had been run over . after examining photographs of the scene of the accident taken by german police , canning concluded : " i do not believe that the images depict how jerry came to meet his premature death .
it is possible that jerry lost his life elsewhere , prior to being placed at this scene . " in november , erica duggan filed the case with the german constitutional court .
" i lost my son , but unless the constitutional court supports my rights , i have the added trauma of having lost justice , " she says .
with her fresh information all pointing to an unsolved mystery , it is now up to the court in karlsruhe to decide the next move .
" who knows why the investigation was so inadequate , but it was , and it 's high time it was reopened , " says schultz .
the facts jeremiah was a 22-year-old british student who had been studying in paris .
in early 2003 , he fell in with a group of young people who sold nouvelle solidarité , a newspaper published by controversial us millionaire and political campaigner lyndon larouche .
the group invited jeremiah to wiesbaden to attend a conference organized by the larouche youth movement and the related schiller institute run by larouche 's german wife helga zepp , which has been described by britain 's metropolitan police as " a political cult with sinister and dangerous connections . "
but jeremiah knew nothing of this .
believing he would be attending a seminar critical of the imminent war against iraq , he left for wiesbaden on march 21 .
on march 27 he rang his mother in london in the middle of the night sounding terrified .
" i am in terrible trouble ... i 'm frightened , " he managed to say before being cut off .
minutes later , he was dead .
to the german police , the call indicated he was suicidal .
to his mother , it sounded as though he feared for his life .
larouche and büso woo idealistic youths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lyndon larouche on the campaign trail according to pastor thomas gandow , sect commissioner of the evangelical church in berlin-brandenburg , jeremiah 's involvement with the schiller institute might well have taken a sinister turn , especially after he revealed he was jewish .
lyndon larouche 's group and its political german wing , büso -lrb- civil rights movement solidarity -rrb- , have long been accused of propagating a virulent brand of anti-semitism .
lecture notes found in jeremiah 's bag after his death apparently pointed to anti-semitic conspiracy theories to explain the background to the iraq war and other global problems .
" we know very little about this institute , " says gandow .
" it appears to operate as an intelligence service as well as a youth religion .
opposing the iraq war is one of the ways it recruits idealistic young people .
" despite being known to operate like a cult , for some reason it is not monitored by the government – even though other sects such as scientology are , " he points out .
" basically , the fact that the institute has not been investigated is a scandal . " anti-semitism the simon wiesenthal centre is equally alarmed by the larouche youth movement and the schiller institute .
last month , its director for international relations shimon samuels wrote to german justice minister brigitte zypries urging her to " reopen the public investigation of this case at the highest federal level , to hold an inquiry as to whether jeremiah duggan 's jewish identity played any role in his death , and to impose the full application of german law to the supervision of the larouche youth movement and its network of affiliates . "
in 2004 , a former member of the schiller institute told the bbc that " people tend to be drawn into it who did not want to be drawn into it - who did not want to join a cult or sect . "
she added that conferences entailed immense psychological duress .
" i was freaked out and i experienced that other people were freaked out .
i saw people who went out of their mind , " she said .
jeremiah might have experienced similar pressure .
" perhaps these people exerted such psychological pressure on jeremiah that he panicked , " says sect commissioner gandow .
" perhaps they wanted to make an example of him .
who knows ? "
standard practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larouche has run as a presidential candidate several times even though jeremiah 's passport was found to have been in the possession of the schiller institute when he died , police failed to question any of its staff .
hartmut ferse , press spokesperson for the public prosecutors ' office in wiesbaden , still insists there was nothing amiss with the way the case was handled .
then as now , police insisted the activities of the schiller institute played " no role " in the investigation .
" this was a cut and dried suicide , " said ferse .
" it is not our job to explore the motives for why someone should take their own life . "
" there was simply no evidence of any third party involvement which would have necessitated further investigation .
clearly , no one pushed this young man onto the road . "
he argues that it is standard practice not to take formal witness statements in a case in which the facts are unequivocal .
" the drivers were questioned and let go , because there was nothing unusual in their statements , " he insists .
lyndon larouche , meanwhile , has dismissed the case as a " hoax " masterminded by his sworn enemy dick cheney .
" london sources tied intimately to dick cheney have once again launched a press campaign on behalf of a repeatedly discredited hoax , " he wrote recently in his newspaper the executive intelligence review .
" this concerns the causes and circumstances of the suicide by a young , emotionally troubled british national , jeremy duggan , who , as the official forensic evidence showed beyond doubt , threw himself repeatedly against moving automobiles on a highway near wiesbaden .

31 , 2007 while those at airports must be lifted by march 30 , 2008 at the latest . currently , 15 countries are signatories to the schengen agreement , including the oldest eu members except britain and ireland , plus non-eu nations , norway and iceland . political motivations ? the schengen zone was established by treaty in 1985 and removes border posts and checks between eu member states and a common " schengen visa , " which allows access to all the signatory countries .
the treaty , however , does not cover residency or work permits for non-eu nationals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu countries such as switzerland also get access the 10 new , mainly eastern european nations in the 25-member bloc were told last year that their schengen entry , originally planned for 2007 , was in doubt due to technical delays with an update for the eu 's central visa information system . some newcomers , however , had said that the reasons were political rather than technical , charging old eu members of trying to block the eastern expansion of the border control-free zone . the new countries to join will include nine of the 10 countries that entered the eu in 2004 - cyprus will continue checking passports - plus switzerland , which is surrounded by eu countries but is not a member . secure borders necessary the 10 countries that joined the eu in 2004 have all ratified the treaty , but have not yet implemented it .
they are estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia , hungary , the czech republic , slovenia , malta and cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : questions remain over incoming bulgaria and romania the move will only take place , however , if the countries ' external borders to the world outside the eu prove up to existing standards and when europe 's schengen database can be expanded to accommodate them .
germany and france had insisted that the new member states also prove their non-schengen frontiers are secure . under tuesday 's decision , the schengen hopefuls will temporarily be allowed to link into the old visa database until the new version is launched in june 2008 . costs for this interim solution are estimated at some 3.6 million euros -lrb- $ 4.8 million -rrb- . eu members will also have to take the formal decision to lift the borders , a move expected in the third quarter of 2007 . have you ever traveled inside the schengen states ?

sweden , however , voted against adopting the euro is a 2003 referendum and has since not renewed efforts to implement the shared currency . slovenia is to test the eurozone waters at the beginning of 2007 by becoming the first to adopt the single currency of the 10 mostly ex-communist countries that joined the european union in 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these are still out of reach of most new eu member states although none of the nine countries under review are reported to have met all of the criteria for joining , the two mediterranean islands of cyprus and malta had a chance of doing so next year . to be able to adopt the euro , candidates must hold inflation low , keep sound finances that meet eu limits , have a stable exchange rate and long-term interest rates as well as ensure their laws are in line with eu and european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- norms . tough challenges however , the inflation and public finances criteria are probably the most difficult to meet for most countries , with lithuania being refused earlier this year entry to the eurozone with slovenia because its inflation was too high . the commission found that the czech republic , cyprus , poland and sweden were the only countries reviewed that met the inflation criteria while estonia , cyprus , latvia and sweden met the public finances , with malta expected to do so next year . only estonia met the exchange rate criteria although malta and cyprus were also expected to make the grade next year while all the countries under review , with the exception of hungary , had long-term interests rates in line with the requirement . on legal requirements , estonia was the only country that had met eu and ecb norms although cyprus and malta were pushing through new laws that would help . lithuania was not included in the report because it was already reviewed earlier this year along with slovenia . getting " euro " right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least spell the name right if you 're going to spend them europe 's central bank also said on tuesday that countries aspiring to join the eurozone should get the spelling of the currency right . the ecb called it was unacceptable that latvia refers to the " eiro " and that hungary adds an acute accent to the " o . " " the euro is the single currency of the member states that have adopted it , " the ecb said .
" to make this singleness apparent , -lrb- eu -rrb- law requires a single spelling of the word ' euro ' in the nominative singular case in all community and national legislative provisions . " if hungary and latvia do not step into line , they could be barred from joining the euro .
but the two countries face bigger challenges meeting eurozone standards on inflation and government borrowing . the ecb does allow greece to refer to the euro in its own alphabet , even putting the four greek letters on its banknotes . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu accepts slovenia , rejects lithuania as euro zone member the european commission gave slovenia a green light tuesday to join europe 's single currency next year , but held off on offering approval to lithuania .

officials in broward county , florida , said they saw a famous " inverted jenny " stamp while reviewing postal ballots .
about 700 of the stamps were mistakenly printed in 1918 with an upside down illustration .
just 100 examples made it into the hands of the public .
but , now philatelists have examined the stamp , they have found it is a common fake of the famously rare article .
" to a trained philatelist , it 's pretty obvious that it 's a counterfeit , " said expert randy shoemaker .
' off-colour ' the give-away signs included an incorrect number of border perforations , the stamp 's thickness and its colour .
" the colour , to me , was off .
it looked more bluish-green than the blue of the genuine , " commented mercer bristow of the american philatelic society .
the stamp was examined by experts for an hour , comparing it to an authentic " inverted jenny " and another fake one .
but , because of its intriguing story , the smithsonian 's national postal museum says it would like to display the envelope with the fake stamp .
the original stamps bear a picture of a curtiss jn-4 plane , known as a jenny , which was used for training pilots in world war i and later became an airmail plane .
the stamp was spotted by broward county commissioner john rodstrom who said he recognised it from when he collected stamps as a child .
the official said the envelope had no return address , and the ballot was disqualified because it gave no clue as to the identity of the voter .
in october 2005 , a block of four inverted jenny stamps sold for $ 2.7m -lrb- £ 1.52m -rrb- at auction .

like-for-like uk sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - rose 5.6 % excluding petrol in the three months to 25 november .
overall group sales excluding petrol rose by 10.3 % during the period , further boosted by overseas sales .
tesco said its quarterly international sales were up 17.9 % .
' respectable numbers ' " there 's all to play for , but so far so good , we are looking forward to having a good christmas , " said tesco strategy and finance director andrew higginson .
exana bnp analyst tim attenborough said tesco 's latest results were " a very respectable set of numbers " .
with tesco accounting for about £ 1 in every £ 8 spent in the uk retail sector , its results are closely watched .
one factor that may catch the attention of the bank of england is that tesco said its uk stores saw price inflation of 0.8 % in the three months , driven by higher energy costs and a rise in meat prices .
however , tesco said it expected this inflationary pressure " to subside in the months ahead " .

with white plastic bags covering his trainers , mokhtar hasbini , 17 , stood on the ramlat al-baida beach and surveyed the scene of destruction .
as beirut 's only public beach it would be normally crowded with pleasure-seekers .
but instead the once-white sands were blackened by an oil slick .
" it was freaky , " says mokhtar , referring to the first time he walked on the beach .
" i had seen oil spills on the television but i never expected to one here in lebanon . "
during the early days of the month-long war between israel and lebanon 's militant group hezbollah , israeli planes bombed the jiyeh power plant - 30 km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of beirut - releasing up to 15,000 tons of oil into the mediterranean sea .
damage limitation days later , the oily waves lapped onto ramlat al-beida beach .
crabs slick with oil scuttled across the black sands .
piles of dead , rotting fish , could be seen everywhere .
other young eco heroes atlanta 's illai kenney challenging corporate big boys bihar bio-reserve green teens clean mean streets green eyes , china protecting the industrial heartland dutch energy bet youngsters take on the government as part of the green line association , an environment group based in beirut , mokhtar and a core of 40 other volunteers set about assessing the extent of the oil slick .
there were grave concerns from environmental groups that if left unattended the oil spill would cause greater harm to the lebanese environment , particularly to the country 's turtles and fishing stocks .
the lebanese government , preoccupied with trying to arrange a ceasefire between the two warring parties , initially did little about the oil slick .
" i just knew that we had to do something , " says mokhtar , a high school student , " because if we did n't , nobody else would . "
' snowball effect ' green line 's assessment of the oil slick was an ambitious undertaking .
the two-week-long project involved visiting every beach in lebanon 's 225 km-long coast .
at the various beaches , the groups of volunteers would dig with spades to discover how far the oil had sunk into the sand , determining what type of clean-up was needed .
oil on the top of the sand could be removed by volunteers wielding spades .
but the oil that had sunk more than a few inches under the sand would require a bulldozer to help clear it away .
in the early days of the assessments , mokhtar joined the teams and took photographs and filmed the scenes of devastation on a small digital camera .
as the group 's press officer he wanted to create a " snowball effect " about the oil slick .
he hoped that by showing that something could be done about the environmental disaster , lebanese citizens would chip in with help and support .
endangered " but it was difficult during the war because everyone was focusing on the fighting , " says the slender-built teenager .
born and brought up in the centre of beirut , mokhtar is fluent in arabic , french and english - and is learning spanish . "
i think volunteering makes you feel better about yourself " mokhtar hasbini his father owns an interior design business , while his mother makes a living from painting .
the young volunteer first got involved with green line at the urging of one of his aunts in the summer of 2005 .
mokhtar 's interest in environmental issues was first whetted by tv documentaries and magazine articles .
" i saw that lebanon 's environment was endangered , " he said .
out of school hours , mokhtar would devote a few hours every week to green line and another organisation where he volunteered .
" i think volunteering makes you feel better about yourself , " he said .
" your self-esteem builds and you grow in front of other people . "
when the oil spill occurred it was during mokhtar 's three-month summer school break enabling the teenager to dedicate himself full-time to the organisation .
with the assessment of lebanon 's beaches well under way , green line began the clean-up of ramlat al-baida .
the organisation bought white overalls , face-masks , rubber gloves and boots to protect the clothes and skin of the volunteers working on the beach .
on the first day , a team of 40 people dug with spades in the stifling humidity shifting the oily sand onto prepared plastic sheets .
for a few days , a bulldozer was drafted in , to move the sand .
volunteers also dragged oil absorption booms onto the beach and laid them at the water 's edge .
once removed the sand was deposited at sites around beirut where it will be stored until it is sent to europe to be cleaned .
lebanon does not have the facilities to do the job .
after two weeks of back-breaking work , the lebanese government moved in to clean the beach .
but not before mokhtar and his fellow volunteers had cleared 300 metres of the 1.5 km stretch of sand .
" we did something for our beach , " said mokhtar with a sense of satisfaction .
" we showed people that we were not going to leave it . "

during the early days of the month-long war between israel and lebanon 's militant group hezbollah , israeli planes bombed the jiyeh power plant - 30 km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of beirut - releasing up to 15,000 tons of oil into the mediterranean sea .

mokhtar was an early volunteer as beirut 's only public beach it would be normally crowded with pleasure-seekers .
but instead the once-white sands were blackened by an oil slick .
" it was freaky , " says mokhtar , referring to the first time he walked on the beach .
" i had seen oil spills on the television but i never expected to one here in lebanon . "
during the early days of the month-long war between israel and lebanon 's militant group hezbollah , israeli planes bombed the jiyeh power plant - 30 km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- south of beirut - releasing up to 15,000 tons of oil into the mediterranean sea .
damage limitation days later , the oily waves lapped onto ramlat al-beida beach .

there were grave concerns from environmental groups that if left unattended the oil spill would cause greater harm to the lebanese environment , particularly to the country 's turtles and fishing stocks .
the lebanese government , preoccupied with trying to arrange a ceasefire between the two warring parties , initially did little about the oil slick .
" i just knew that we had to do something , " says mokhtar , a high school student , " because if we did n't , nobody else would . "
' snowball effect ' green line 's assessment of the oil slick was an ambitious undertaking .
the two-week-long project involved visiting every beach in lebanon 's 225 km-long coast .

oil on the top of the sand could be removed by volunteers wielding spades .
but the oil that had sunk more than a few inches under the sand would require a bulldozer to help clear it away .
in the early days of the assessments , mokhtar joined the teams and took photographs and filmed the scenes of devastation on a small digital camera .
as the group 's press officer he wanted to create a " snowball effect " about the oil slick .
he hoped that by showing that something could be done about the environmental disaster , lebanese citizens would chip in with help and support .
endangered " but it was difficult during the war because everyone was focusing on the fighting , " says the slender-built teenager .

the young volunteer first got involved with green line at the urging of one of his aunts in the summer of 2005 .
mokhtar 's interest in environmental issues was first whetted by tv documentaries and magazine articles .
" i saw that lebanon 's environment was endangered , " he said .
out of school hours , mokhtar would devote a few hours every week to green line and another organisation where he volunteered .
" i think volunteering makes you feel better about yourself , " he said .
" your self-esteem builds and you grow in front of other people . "
absorption booms to soak up the oil were laid beside the water 's edge when the oil spill occurred it was during mokhtar 's three-month summer school break enabling the teenager to dedicate himself full-time to the organisation .
with the assessment of lebanon 's beaches well under way , green line began the clean-up of ramlat al-baida .
the organisation bought white overalls , face-masks , rubber gloves and boots to protect the clothes and skin of the volunteers working on the beach .
on the first day , a team of 40 people dug with spades in the stifling humidity shifting the oily sand onto prepared plastic sheets .
for a few days , a bulldozer was drafted in , to move the sand .
volunteers also dragged oil absorption booms onto the beach and laid them at the water 's edge .
once removed the sand was deposited at sites around beirut where it will be stored until it is sent to europe to be cleaned .
lebanon does not have the facilities to do the job .
after two weeks of back-breaking work , the lebanese government moved in to clean the beach .
but not before mokhtar and his fellow volunteers had cleared 300 metres of the 1.5 km stretch of sand .
" we did something for our beach , " said mokhtar with a sense of satisfaction .
" we showed people that we were not going to leave it . "

being 14 is no obstacle to helping the planet , judging by the example of a group of dutch school kids fired up by an idea as bright as an energy-saving light bulb .
the schoolchildren from almere taking part in the bet enlarge image thanks indirectly to their efforts , vehicles at the netherlands ' environment ministry will be running on natural gas by the spring of 2007 .
the teenagers in almere , a futuristic new town near amsterdam , had called on the environment minister to outdo them personally in ways to save energy .
over four weeks , and under the arbitration of environmental organisation friends of the earth , the two sides vied to come up with ideas for meeting the european union 's minimum kyoto goal of 8 % savings .
children from helen parkhurst school , which already has its own wind turbines , pursued the bet at home , in class and in local businesses .
other eco heroes atlanta 's illai kenney challenging corporate big boys china 's green eyes : focus on industrial heartland mokhtar hasbini saving lebanon 's war-damaged beach bihar 's green teens cleaning india 's mean streets it meant a coffee cut for some and computer deprivation for others , but a government prize of 2,000 ecologically clean euros -lrb- $ 2,560 -rrb- beckoned if they won .
if they lost , the kids - average age 14 - would have to pull state secretary pieter van geel around the hague for a day in a rickshaw .
and mr van geel mounted an inventive campaign of his own featuring , among other things , al gore and some " standby killers " .
daylight saving one of the school 's five blocks managed to get by with having the lights switched off for 20 hours a week this autumn .
i am always using my bike - i go everywhere on it maikel breedveld , 15 the bet in pictures " it was n't really dark , just a little bit dimmer , " says ivar geel , 15 .
another , more lasting innovation , was to turn off school computers at 4pm each day rather than leaving them on stand-by overnight .
but the idea of not turning on the coffee machines for a day was not a universal hit .
" the teachers got quite cranky , " recalls saraya ganzeules , 16 .
saraya and her friends persuaded 10 local businesses to save energy .
a bakery , for example , began turning off its lights , ovens and heating earlier .
the kids brought the bet home with them too , asking their families to turn down the heating , take shorter showers and keep the tap switched off when brushing their teeth .
the mother of lindsay reiche , 14 , decided that the family 's computer would be kept switched off two days a week .
maikel breedveld , 15 , says with a grin that his personal contribution to conserving heat at home was to keep doors closed , trapping warm air inside .
the kids also talked about the greenhouse effect to other schoolchildren , making a simplified presentation for primary school pupils .
the minister 's message mr van geel 's lifestyle before the almere bet was already fairly green , and it was a challenge to come up with fresh ideas .
it is very brave for schoolchildren to try to convince all those school directors to spend more money on greener electricity pieter van geel dutch environment minister along with ordering natural gas cars , he organised a showing of al gore 's film an inconvenient truth for ministry staff and children invited school magazine editors to a news conference about the same film arranged an energy audit of his ministry made an appeal on the ministry intranet asking staff to help save energy in his own home , he installed standby " killers " which stop the waste of electricity involved in leaving devices on standby .
in all , the minister achieved an impressive 20 % energy savings - but it was the almere kids who won the bet , with a staggering 33 % cut .
visiting the school to present the cheque , mr van geel was particularly struck by efforts the kids had made to convert other schools in almere to switch to green energy .
" it is very brave for schoolchildren to participate in school board meetings and try to convince all those school directors to spend more money on greener electricity , " he says .
a greener generation ?
the almere bet , the latest in a series of such initiatives going back to 2001 in the netherlands , was also about showing " the politicians how easy it is to save energy " , says grietje holleman of friends of the earth holland -lrb- foenl -rrb- .
a cleaner , greener town almere in pictures with the bet over , do the almere kids foresee a greener lifestyle for their generation ?
they have a certain impetus to do so .
almere is a leafy town built from scratch on reclaimed land just 30 years ago .
it is criss-crossed by dedicated bus routes and car-free cycle routes , and has a hi-tech concealed waste disposal system .
ivar says he wants to avoid using cars when he grows up : " when my mum and dad go to a friend 's house , they use the car but when i am older i plan to go everywhere on my bike - it will save the air from the petrol fumes . "
lukasz dabrowski , 14 , wants to see more use of solar panels and wind turbines to generate electricity .
for valerie buijs , 15 , energy conservation remains the main thing : " everybody must help all over the world to save energy by showering less , and turning off the heater and the lights . "
as for the 2,000-euro prize , it will help buy a display panel to monitor power generated by the dutch school 's roof-top " windmills " - the turbines which already meet nearly a third of its energy needs .

being 14 is no obstacle to helping the planet , judging by the example of a group of dutch school kids fired up by an idea as bright as an energy-saving light bulb .
thanks indirectly to their efforts , vehicles at the netherlands ' environment ministry will be running on natural gas by the spring of 2007 .
the teenagers in almere , a futuristic new town near amsterdam , had called on the environment minister to outdo them personally in ways to save energy .
over four weeks , and under the arbitration of environmental organisation friends of the earth , the two sides vied to come up with ideas for meeting the european union 's minimum kyoto goal of 8 % savings .
children from helen parkhurst school , which already has its own wind turbines , pursued the bet at home , in class and in local businesses .
other eco heroes atlanta 's illai kenney challenging corporate big boys china 's green eyes : focus on industrial heartland mokhtar hasbini saving lebanon 's war-damaged beach bihar 's green teens cleaning india 's mean streets it meant a coffee cut for some and computer deprivation for others , but a government prize of 2,000 ecologically clean euros -lrb- $ 2,560 -rrb- beckoned if they won .
if they lost , the kids - average age 14 - would have to pull state secretary pieter van geel around the hague for a day in a rickshaw .
and mr van geel mounted an inventive campaign of his own featuring , among other things , al gore and some " standby killers " .
daylight saving one of the school 's five blocks managed to get by with having the lights switched off for 20 hours a week this autumn . "
i am always using my bike - i go everywhere on it " maikel breedveld , 15 the bet in pictures " it was n't really dark , just a little bit dimmer , " says ivar geel , 15 .
another , more lasting innovation , was to turn off school computers at 4pm each day rather than leaving them on stand-by overnight .
but the idea of not turning on the coffee machines for a day was not a universal hit .
" the teachers got quite cranky , " recalls saraya ganzeules , 16 .
saraya and her friends persuaded 10 local businesses to save energy .
a bakery , for example , began turning off its lights , ovens and heating earlier .
the kids brought the bet home with them too , asking their families to turn down the heating , take shorter showers and keep the tap switched off when brushing their teeth .
the mother of lindsay reiche , 14 , decided that the family 's computer would be kept switched off two days a week .
maikel breedveld , 15 , says with a grin that his personal contribution to conserving heat at home was to keep doors closed , trapping warm air inside .
the kids also talked about the greenhouse effect to other schoolchildren , making a simplified presentation for primary school pupils .
the minister 's message mr van geel 's lifestyle before the almere bet was already fairly green , and it was a challenge to come up with fresh ideas . "
it is very brave for schoolchildren to try to convince all those school directors to spend more money on greener electricity " pieter van geel dutch environment minister along with ordering natural gas cars , he organised a showing of al gore 's film an inconvenient truth for ministry staff and children invited school magazine editors to a news conference about the same film arranged an energy audit of his ministry made an appeal on the ministry intranet asking staff to help save energy in his own home , he installed standby " killers " which stop the waste of electricity involved in leaving devices on standby .
in all , the minister achieved an impressive 20 % energy savings - but it was the almere kids who won the bet , with a staggering 33 % cut .
visiting the school to present the cheque , mr van geel was particularly struck by efforts the kids had made to convert other schools in almere to switch to green energy .
" it is very brave for schoolchildren to participate in school board meetings and try to convince all those school directors to spend more money on greener electricity , " he says .
a greener generation ?
the almere bet , the latest in a series of such initiatives going back to 2001 in the netherlands , was also about showing " the politicians how easy it is to save energy " , says grietje holleman of friends of the earth holland -lrb- foenl -rrb- .

speaking at a high-level conference on the issue , mr annan said nobody should be above the law .
he said the un was working on a binding treaty on the prosecution of sexual abuse committed by peacekeepers .
the un says about 80 % of 100,000 people serving in its peacekeeping operations can not be disciplined by it .
the conference comes a week after a bbc report highlighted claims of children being subjected to rape and prostitution by un peacekeepers in haiti and liberia .
retribution fears mr annan said all un personnel , whether civilian or uniformed , had to understand that sexual exploitation and abuse was " utterly immoral " , at odds with the un mission and would be punished .
" there have been crimes such as rape , paedophilia and human trafficking , " he said .
" my message of zero tolerance has still not got through to those who need to hear it - from managers on the ground , to all our other personnel . "
mr annan said it was essential that the un create an environment in which people felt able to report allegations of sexual abuse without fear of retribution .
participants at the day-long conference approved a statement committing themselves to implementing 10 strategic goals .
they include policies on improving training for personnel , preventing those who commit abuse being re-hired and taking action to prevent retaliation after allegations of sexual abuse are made .
the un 's own figures show 316 peacekeeping personnel in all missions have been investigated , resulting in the summary dismissal of 18 civilians , repatriation of 17 members of formed police units and 144 repatriations or rotations home on disciplinary grounds .

sun miaosun devotes precious hours to the protection of rare species in zhejiang province in eastern china .
the crowded outdoor food markets of pingyang county display long lines of cages and crates crammed full of animals , many of them endangered .
miaosun and his friends rise early , sometimes before dawn .
wearing their distinctive green eyes china baseball caps they move through the market quickly , recording what they see with video cameras .
endangered breeds of frogs , snakes , owls and eagles are for sale - some already prepared for the cooking pot .
social stability " when we arrive the stall-holders run away , or they say the animals do n't belong to them , " he said .
sun miaosun , 17 , is one of the 2000 members of green eyes china , a young person 's environmental group which is working to expose the animal rights abuses and environmental damage in china 's industrial heartland .
other young eco heroes atlanta 's illai kenney challenging corporate big boys bihar bio-reserve : green teens clean mean streets mokhtar hasbini saving lebanon 's war-damaged beach dutch energy bet youngsters take on the government they face a huge challenge .
china 's environmental record is one of the poorest in the world , and animal rights are a relatively new concept .
acid rain falls on around a third of the country , the water in most of its rivers is unfit to drink or fish in .
campaigners say that the country is on the brink of environmental collapse .
even the government agrees .
the state environmental protection administration -lrb- sepa -rrb- recently warned that the situation was endangering people 's health and risking the social stability of the country .
" the brick factories here pollute the environment terribly because they burn lots of coal , " said another campaigner zen ruigui .
" the dyeing factories drain their effluent directly into the rivers .
there 's also been extensive deforestation , " he added .
suspicion the green eyes activists keep a watch on polluters .
the emphasis is on supervision and reporting - they work with older members to avoid direct confrontation with polluters , or with those trading in endangered species .
their work is all the more impressive given the difficulty facing non-governmental organisations in china .
such groups are regarded with suspicion by the ruling communist party .
china 's first environmental group was established in only 1995 , green eyes in 2000 . "
we want to give society a signal that schoolchildren have the right to take part in environmental protection " fang minghe it was founded by fang minghe , 22 , when he was a schoolboy .
being young is an advantage , he says .
" people think we 're too innocent to be a threat , " he said .
" we want to give society a signal that schoolchildren have the right to take part in environmental protection .
" it 's not only their obligation , it 's their right - it 's in the un convention on the rights of the child .
though for some chinese people this is a step too far . "
the group works with the local authorities , including the police , and claims credit for some 26 criminal prosecutions .
it also helps on environmental clean-ups , and runs an animal sanctuary , saving around 100 animals a year .
china 's government agencies are ill-equipped for the enormous task facing them .
sepa has only 200 staff and little clout within the government structure .
earlier this year china 's forestry bureau provoked outrage when it attempted to sell hunting licences , some for endangered species , to foreign hunters .
government spend fang says " we 're doing a much better job than the local forestry bureau here .
it 's really inspired us , a non-governmental organisation can actually do quite a lot . "
but he is realistic about the task ahead .
" we often wonder if protection can catch up with the damage .
why do we blindly pursue economic growth ? "
china 's leadership is waking up to the problem .
earlier this year it revealed plans to spend 1.4 trillion yuan -lrb- $ 175bn -rrb- over the next five years on protecting the environment .
yang qing , 18 , believes that is not enough .
" we need to let people know just how badly polluted the country has become .
we all need to start protecting the environment , " she says .
the commitment of the green eyes activists is all the more remarkable because it exists in a country unused to direct and independent action by its citizens .
and its members understand that the environmental situation is one of the most critical issues facing not just their generation , but future generations to come .

the emphasis is on supervision and reporting - they work with older members to avoid direct confrontation with polluters , or with those trading in endangered species .
their work is all the more impressive given the difficulty facing non-governmental organisations in china .
such groups are regarded with suspicion by the ruling communist party .

she was 16 years old at the time , a black student from atlanta , georgia , in a room full of " old white guys " hearing a report about the value of their investments .
illai kenney has targeted coca-cola and power companies she had something else on her mind : what she called the drinks giant 's " irresponsible and dangerous " use of water in india .
" water is not a luxury ; water is a human right , " she said , demanding that coca-cola stop using indian groundwater to make its beverages .
speaking to the bbc 18 months later , she is still passionate about the issue .

she had heard about the issue from her mother , who is also an environmental and community activist .
" we learned about carbon dioxide and mercury and its effects on animals and people , " she says .

there must have been some puzzled looks when illai kenney stood up to ask a question at the coca-cola annual shareholders meeting last year .
she was 16 years old at the time , a black student from atlanta , georgia , in a room full of " old white guys " hearing a report about the value of their investments .
illai kenney has targeted coca-cola and power companies she had something else on her mind : what she called the drinks giant 's " irresponsible and dangerous " use of water in india .
" water is not a luxury ; water is a human right , " she said , demanding that coca-cola stop using indian groundwater to make its beverages .
speaking to the bbc 18 months later , she is still passionate about the issue .
" the idea that you 're going to take water out of my backyard and sell it back to me for more than i can afford ? " she demands .
" that would upset me . "
other young eco heroes china 's green eyes focusing on the industrial heartland bihar 's bio-reserve : teens clean india 's mean streets mokhtar hasbini saving lebanon 's war-damaged beach dutch energy bet youngsters take on the government and coke , she points out , is in her backyard - its corporate headquarters is in atlanta , near where she lives .
coca-cola denies that it is responsible for decreasing levels of groundwater in the indian state of kerala .
it says the state 's high court determined that water tables have dropped due to below-average rainfall , not coca-cola 's activities .
but the company has kept the kerala plant shuttered since march 2004 , in response to an earlier order from the court , coca-cola spokesman pablo largacha says .
' voice of youth ' illai kenney considers that to be one of the most successful campaigns she has worked on .
she believes it would not have closed as quickly without the pressure from indian environmental groups and their allies in the united states .
if it looks bad , and smells bad , it probably is bad - even a six-year-old can understand it illai kenney coke told to shut plant it was one of those allies , corporate accountability international , which recruited illai to speak at the shareholders ' event .
" she was the voice of youth at that meeting , " says gigi kellett , the associate campaigns director of the activist group .
ms kellett knew illai had been organising young people 's activism on the issue in atlanta , and wanted her to speak for them because " she is thoughtful and committed and dedicated to being a part of something that 's going to have a real impact " .
that quality may be why she is already a veteran environmental activist , although she is only 17 years old .
simple science she co-founded the georgia state chapter of kids against pollution when she was 12 .
coal-fired power was one of the first issues to catch illai 's attention soon after , she staged a press conference with other young people at the headquarters of a company that runs coal-fired power plants .
she had heard about the issue from her mother , who is also an environmental and community activist .
" we learned about carbon dioxide and mercury and its effects on animals and people , " she says .
she admits that her understanding of the science may not have been sophisticated , but says the general principle is all too easy to grasp : " if it looks bad , and smells bad , it probably is bad .
even a six-year-old can understand it . "
youngest delegate that press conference turned out to be the first step in a busy career as an activist .
in 2002 , she was the youngest delegate at the united nations world summit on sustainable development in johannesburg .
illai was struck by the resilience of people hit by katrina seeing extremes of wealth and poverty there " made connections click " for her about global responsibility .
" on one side of the street it looked like suburban america , and on the other side , a shantytown would have been a step up - if you had running water , you were rich . "
she says young people can be just as effective fighting for such causes as adults .
" people wonder how i can have any influence given that i ca n't vote .
but i can go to elected officials with 300 signatures of people who can vote or will be able to the next time they 're running for office . "
and kids have buying power , too , she observes .
" we could get a lot of companies to look at us if we say we wo n't buy their products .
that 's how things were done in the civil rights movement . "
' whose problem is it ? '
she is briefly taken aback by the question of why a teenager in the suburbs of atlanta should spend her time fighting for people living in india , mississippi or south africa .
then she replies with a question of her own .
" if it 's not my problem , whose problem is it ?
" i know kids who have never been out of the atlanta area .
i 've been all over the world .
i would feel like i am taking for granted what i have been given if i do n't try to have an impact . "

the children have planted over 30 street side gardens pics : prashant ravi in busy and chaotic patna , capital of bihar , one of india 's most backward and poorest states , a 10-acre farm has been converted into the city 's only bio-reserve , by children .
they belong to taru mitra -lrb- friends of trees -rrb- , a group of youngsters committed to preserving the environment .
the dense reserve is dotted with some 50 varieties of trees , environment-friendly buildings with bamboo and waste paper roofs , ponds , a solar energy-powered office , and a compost making unit .
all of this is the labour of love of a few thousand children from a little more than 100 schools in a city where lawlessness is rife and children have been kidnapped in the past for ransom .
abhishek bharadwaj , 15 , achala parmar , 14 , and wartika pande , 13 , are among the school children who have been planting trees and greening a city where , by one estimate , there is only one tree for every 2,000 people .

we thought that if people around us are not doing things to clean things up , we should take it up and do something about it , " says achala , daughter of a doctor father and homemaker mother .
by all accounts , the green warriors of taru mitra have achieved quite a lot .
apart from creating a green lung , they have cleaned up large tracts of the city 's grimy streets , cleared pig sties and set up some 25 small gardens .
they have also set up eight nurseries , which sell plants at half the market price to students .
that is not all .
they have run a successful campaign against truckers who create sand pollution that chokes the city .
these trucks typically pick up sand for building construction from the banks of the river ganges nearby and carry it all over the city with no cover to keep the load contained .
for many years , the children have been stopping vehicles to do pollution checks .
they gave out 2,500 pollution under control certificates last year alone in the city , after authorities gave them the nod .
they have travelled to the town of hazaribagh and cleaned up the place after goading the local people to join them .
back home in patna , they have used pitcher irrigation - earthen pitchers buried to their neck in the soil and filled with water which seeps through its pores - to grow plants .
the indefatigable green teen brigade have even shamed local litterbugs by handing them on-the-spot fines of two rupees at the annual 10-day-long city book fair .
" sometimes , people refuse to pay children , " says achala .
" but our smiles work in the end . "
their work has earned the plaudits of environmental groups and the united nations .
the three children have travelled abroad to spread the good word and present papers at international conferences .

" when i went to my native village and saw the blue sky and breathed the clean air , i realised how polluted my city was , " says waritika .
the bio reserve is an oasis of green in polluted patna it has not been easy to put environment on the agenda in a city plagued by utter official inefficiency , soaring crime and massive corruption .
in 1993 , a taru mitra volunteer - a 21-year-old boy - died after a drunken man shot at him during a fair in the city .

the children have planted over 30 street side gardens pics : prashant ravi in busy and chaotic patna , capital of bihar , one of india 's most backward and poorest states , a 10-acre farm has been converted into the city 's only bio-reserve , by children .
they belong to taru mitra -lrb- friends of trees -rrb- , a group of youngsters committed to preserving the environment .
the dense reserve is dotted with some 50 varieties of trees , environment-friendly buildings with bamboo and waste paper roofs , ponds , a solar energy-powered office , and a compost making unit .
all of this is the labour of love of a few thousand children from a little more than 100 schools in a city where lawlessness is rife and children have been kidnapped in the past for ransom .
abhishek bharadwaj , 15 , achala parmar , 14 , and wartika pande , 13 , are among the school children who have been planting trees and greening a city where , by one estimate , there is only one tree for every 2,000 people .
pollution campaign other eco heroes atlanta 's illai kenney challenging corporate big boys china 's green eyes : focusing on the industrial heartland mokhtar hasbini saving lebanon 's war-damaged beach dutch energy bet youngsters take on the government " there is so much pollution in patna .
we thought that if people around us are not doing things to clean things up , we should take it up and do something about it , " says achala , daughter of a doctor father and homemaker mother .
by all accounts , the green warriors of taru mitra have achieved quite a lot .
apart from creating a green lung , they have cleaned up large tracts of the city 's grimy streets , cleared pig sties and set up some 25 small gardens .
they have also set up eight nurseries , which sell plants at half the market price to students .
that is not all .
they have run a successful campaign against truckers who create sand pollution that chokes the city .
these trucks typically pick up sand for building construction from the banks of the river ganges nearby and carry it all over the city with no cover to keep the load contained .
for many years , the children have been stopping vehicles to do pollution checks .
they gave out 2,500 pollution under control certificates last year alone in the city , after authorities gave them the nod .
they have travelled to the town of hazaribagh and cleaned up the place after goading the local people to join them .
back home in patna , they have used pitcher irrigation - earthen pitchers buried to their neck in the soil and filled with water which seeps through its pores - to grow plants .
the indefatigable green teen brigade have even shamed local litterbugs by handing them on-the-spot fines of two rupees at the annual 10-day-long city book fair .
" sometimes , people refuse to pay children , " says achala .
" but our smiles work in the end . "
their work has earned the plaudits of environmental groups and the united nations .
the three children have travelled abroad to spread the good word and present papers at international conferences .
manic zeal most of the volunteers decided to become activists after watching their city become a veritable dumping ground .
" when i went to my native village and saw the blue sky and breathed the clean air , i realised how polluted my city was , " says waritika .
the bio reserve is an oasis of green in polluted patna it has not been easy to put environment on the agenda in a city plagued by utter official inefficiency , soaring crime and massive corruption .
in 1993 , a taru mitra volunteer - a 21-year-old boy - died after a drunken man shot at him during a fair in the city .
but the spirit of the movement never died , and with time , taru mitra has become a model of proactive movement by children to improve the environment .
it has spawned branches in other parts of the country .
none of the children wants to lose touch with their mission after they move on in life .

the two-month " end the silence " campaign will run through december and january - the months when reports to the police of abuse traditionally rise .
the force has pledged to bring more offenders before the courts and reduce the trend to allow a " cooling off " period in police cells .
chief constable mike craik said the level of domestic abuse was " shameful " .
the force has commissioned a training dvd to help frontline officers deal more effectively with domestic abuse .
mr craik said : " we are raising our game against people who commit domestic abuse .
women terrorised " it 's a crime which goes unreported and is not talked about .
it happens between people of all ages and same sex partners as well as men and women in traditional relationships . "
research shows an average victim will have suffered 35 incidents of abuse before reporting anything to police .
two women die every week in the uk as a result of domestic abuse .
mr craik added : " domestic abuse is a serious crime , it 's about people , mostly women , being terrorised , raped and murdered .
" it 's about children witnessing and suffering things which should never be a part of childhood .
" these early experiences can have an untold negative impact on their future behaviour and health .
" even if victims are reluctant to make statements , a prosecution could go ahead if there is other supporting evidence . "
a dedicated helpline has been set up for victims - 0800 066 5555 .

a us team found brown clouds , which cloak much of south asia , have a negative impact on rice output by reducing sunlight and rainfall .
they discovered elevated levels of greenhouse gases also reduced yields .
the study , reported in proceedings of the national academy of sciences , came a day after researchers said new crops adapted to a warmer climate are needed . "
this research ... gives policy makers a lever to increase rice output " maximilian auffhammer , university of california since the 1980s , india has faced ever-declining growth rates in harvests of its staple food , raising concerns that shortages could occur .
to investigate the cause , researchers looked at the impact of the " brown clouds " or " asian haze " which cover the region .
south asia has one of the most widespread atmospheric brown clouds on the planet .
blocking the rays these layers of air pollution , which contain soot and other fine particles , are primarily created from burning fossil fuels and other organic matter .
the clouds interfere with the local climate by blocking the sun 's radiation from reaching the ground , leading to cooler and dimmer conditions .
recent research has revealed the polluted haze can also reduce rainfall .
using climate models and historical data on indian rice harvests , the team built up a picture of the brown clouds ' effect on rice growth over the years .
" we found if there had been no atmospheric brown clouds between 1985 and 1998 , the annual rice harvest yield would have been 11 % higher than it was , " said maximilian auffhammer of the university of california at berkeley .
the team concluded the clouds had a negative effect on rice yields .
he said while the cooler night-time temperatures caused by the clouds were beneficial for the rice , the negative impact of the decreasing rainfall outweighed these benefits .
useful levers yields would also have been higher under lower concentrations of greenhouse gases , the researchers found .
many researchers , dr auffhammer told the bbc news website , had been worried that reducing brown clouds could boost temperatures and so further diminish rice yields .
crops needed to avoid famine this was because previous research found the clouds ' cooling properties can mask the heating effect of greenhouse gases .
but , he said , the team 's findings revealed that reducing clouds alone or with reductions in greenhouse gases would benefit rice output .
he added the study only looked into farming regions which primarily used rain to water their crops .
he said the effect would be less pronounced on areas which relied on other irrigation methods .
on monday , the consultative group on international agricultural research -lrb- cgiar -rrb- , the global network of research centres devoted to farming in developing countries , warned of an urgent need to develop new strains of staple crops , including rice , which are tailored to the changed conditions of the future .
the researchers said they now plan to look at other countries with polluted atmospheres , such as china and indonesia .
dr auffhammer said : " i think this research is crucial because it gives policymakers a lever to increase rice output .

the government-run indian council of agricultural research -lrb- icar -rrb- said it was not immediately concerned with the findings .
dr shukla , deputy director general of icar , told the bbc that global warming and air pollution could not be limited to a specific country and would have a global impact .
he said his organisation was more concerned about the issues of water management , nutrients and rice varieties .

a us team found brown clouds , which cloak much of south asia , have a negative impact on rice output by reducing sunlight and rainfall .
they discovered elevated levels of greenhouse gases also reduced yields .
the study , reported in proceedings of the national academy of sciences , came a day after researchers said new crops adapted to a warmer climate are needed .
this research ... gives policy makers a lever to increase rice output maximilian auffhammer , university of california since the 1980s , india has faced ever-declining growth rates in harvests of its staple food , raising concerns that shortages could occur .
to investigate the cause , researchers looked at the impact of the " brown clouds " or " asian haze " which cover the region .
south asia has one of the most widespread atmospheric brown clouds on the planet .
blocking the rays these layers of air pollution , which contain soot and other fine particles , are primarily created from burning fossil fuels and other organic matter .
the haze can hang heavy over cities such as calcutta the clouds interfere with the local climate by blocking the sun 's radiation from reaching the ground , leading to cooler and dimmer conditions .
recent research has revealed the polluted haze can also reduce rainfall .
using climate models and historical data on indian rice harvests , the team built up a picture of the brown clouds ' effect on rice growth over the years .
" we found if there had been no atmospheric brown clouds between 1985 and 1998 , the annual rice harvest yield would have been 11 % higher than it was , " said maximilian auffhammer of the university of california at berkeley .
the team concluded the clouds had a negative effect on rice yields .
he said while the cooler night-time temperatures caused by the clouds were beneficial for the rice , the negative impact of the decreasing rainfall outweighed these benefits .
useful levers yields would also have been higher under lower concentrations of greenhouse gases , the researchers found .
many researchers , dr auffhammer told the bbc news website , had been worried that reducing brown clouds could boost temperatures and so further diminish rice yields .
crops needed to avoid famine this was because previous research found the clouds ' cooling properties can mask the heating effect of greenhouse gases .
but , he said , the team 's findings revealed that reducing clouds alone or with reductions in greenhouse gases would benefit rice output .
he added the study only looked into farming regions which primarily used rain to water their crops .
he said the effect would be less pronounced on areas which relied on other irrigation methods .
on monday , the consultative group on international agricultural research -lrb- cgiar -rrb- , the global network of research centres devoted to farming in developing countries , warned of an urgent need to develop new strains of staple crops , including rice , which are tailored to the changed conditions of the future .
the researchers said they now plan to look at other countries with polluted atmospheres , such as china and indonesia .
dr auffhammer said : " i think this research is crucial because it gives policymakers a lever to increase rice output .

a judicial inquiry found awb broke united nations oil-for-food programme rules by paying saddam hussein $ 222m -lrb- £ 112m -rrb- to secure contracts .
the government said awb would lose its power to veto exports for six months .
stripping awb of its export control should help other australian firms sell crops after this year 's severe drought .
largest supplier australia has suffered its worst drought in a century , harming its wheat production .
removing awb 's powers to control exports could help firms that want to sell their wheat and mean the limited wheat produced has a market .
" we see this as resolving the differences that exist in relation to the current crop , " said prime minister john howard .
laws will be hurried through parliament to take away awb 's power to veto competitors from exporting wheat .
australia 's wheat regime , by having a single body that decides who can export , has been criticised for pushing up prices .
a rival to awb has said it will seek to export 2 million tonnes of wheat , having previously been vetoed by awb .
the australian government had threatened to end awb 's monopoly entirely amid wider plans to reform the tarnished wheat sector , following the oil-for-food scandal .
the inquiry cleared the australian government of involvement in bribes .
awb had been the largest single supplier of humanitarian goods to iraq under the un programme , which ran from 1996 to 2003 .
the wheat supply came within a un programme aimed at allowing iraq to use money from oil exports to purchase food and medicine , to counter suffering caused by international sanctions under saddam hussein 's regime .

in a speech to the nhs confederation , he called on managers and doctors to sell reforms to the public in england .
mr blair said many people were resistant to change , but it was necessary to improve patient services .
it comes as a left-wing think tank warns campaigns to save local a & e units from closure could lead to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths each year .
the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said specialist units were better for high-risk patients .
the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress tony blair clinicians ' case for change opposition stance critics of the reforms say downgrading traditional a & e units will put patient lives at risk and are being carried out to cut costs .
and the guardian newspaper reports that ministers have accepted in private that they have failed to sell nhs reform effectively to the public .
speaking to an audience of nhs managers and doctors , mr blair said service improvements in nhs hospitals were being implemented to ensure the very sick have speedy access to specialist care but also to treat people more conveniently closer to home .
the prime minister said no change was not an option .
the key was to shape change to ensure a vibrant future for the nhs .
he conceded that there was " in-built resistance " to change , and that managers had a tough job selling it to the public .
but he said : " the best reason for all this change is the best reason there possibly can be : better care for the patient .
" i genuinely believe the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress . "
range of reforms meanwhile , two government advisers , sir george alberti and professor roger boyle , have published separate reports arguing the case for reform of services .
what local people want is access to excellent care which they can get to easily professor christopher marks cancer surgeon they set out a pyramid structure whereby super regional hospitals and specialist centres would provide the most complex care , while the second tier includes local hospitals with minor injury units - a scaled down version of a & e - walk-in centres and specialist gp services .
there will also be more of an emphasis on providing care at home and in community settings .
professor boyle , the national director for coronary heart disease , told the bbc : " the message is quite a simple one .
modern medicine moves on , the new technologies need to be made available to everybody , they do require more specialised care , and they require more specialised investigation .
" we have to move the patients to the expertise rather more than we do at the moment . "
the ippr finding is based on data showing how many extra lives could be saved if everyone had access to new techniques to treat heart attacks .
if heart attack care was reconfigured to ensure universal access to emergency angioplasty , around 500 extra lives could be saved every year , it said .
last year only 1,600 of 61,000 heart attack patients were treated in a specialist unit .

the royal college of surgeons and british orthopaedic society estimates that universal access to specialist trauma centres could save around 770 lives a year .
reconfiguring services the ippr researchers said people should be out on the streets campaigning for changes to the way hospitals provide services rather than campaigning to keep traditional services open .
" we 're not saying that hospitals should close , we 're talking about reconfiguring services , " said ippr research fellow joe farrington-douglas .
he said : " the nhs and government should be able to demonstrate how changes will improve care and local people should hold the nhs to account , but they need to understand that preserving the local hospital will not always be in their best interest if something life-threatening happens . "
he added : " some district hospitals are not as safe as they should be and that point has not been effectively made . "
dr jonathan fielden , chairman of the bma 's consultants ' committee said decisions on reconfiguration must be based on " good evidence " .

" thanks to the money that the government has put in , particularly to a & e , the service has improved marvellously , and it is a pity to throw the baby out with the bath water when you have spent all this money . "
dr richard taylor , the independent mp for wyre forest , who campaigned against the closure of his local hospital in kidderminster , admitted that campaigns to save local facilities were driven in some part by emotion .

" there has got to be compromise that keeps adequate facilities at a wider range of acute general hospitals than these super-specialist centres alone . "

in a speech to the nhs confederation , he called on managers and doctors to sell reforms to the public in england .
mr blair said many people were resistant to change , but it was necessary to improve patient services .
it comes as a left-wing think tank warns campaigns to save local a & e units from closure could lead to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths each year .
the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said specialist units were better for high-risk patients .
the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress tony blair clinicians ' case for change opposition stance critics of the reforms say downgrading traditional a & e units will put patient lives at risk and are being carried out to cut costs .
and the guardian newspaper reports that ministers have accepted in private that they have failed to sell nhs reform effectively to the public .
speaking to an audience of nhs managers and doctors , mr blair said service improvements in nhs hospitals were being implemented to ensure the very sick have speedy access to specialist care but also to treat people more conveniently closer to home .
the prime minister said no change was not an option .
the key was to shape change to ensure a vibrant future for the nhs .
he conceded that there was " in-built resistance " to change , and that managers had a tough job selling it to the public .
but he said : " the best reason for all this change is the best reason there possibly can be : better care for the patient .
" i genuinely believe the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress . "

there will also be more of an emphasis on providing care at home and in community settings .
professor boyle , the national director for coronary heart disease , told the bbc : " the message is quite a simple one .

in a speech to the nhs confederation , he called on managers and doctors to sell reforms to the public in england .
mr blair said many people were resistant to change , but it was necessary to improve patient services .
it comes as a left-wing think tank warns campaigns to save local a & e units from closure could lead to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths each year .
the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- said specialist units were better for high-risk patients .
the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress tony blair clinicians ' case for change opposition stance critics of the reforms say downgrading traditional a & e units will put patient lives at risk and are being carried out to cut costs .
and the guardian newspaper reports that ministers have accepted in private that they have failed to sell nhs reform effectively to the public .
speaking to an audience of nhs managers and doctors , mr blair said service improvements in nhs hospitals were being implemented to ensure the very sick have speedy access to specialist care but also to treat people more conveniently closer to home .
the prime minister said no change was not an option .
the key was to shape change to ensure a vibrant future for the nhs .
he conceded that there was " in-built resistance " to change , and that managers had a tough job selling it to the public .
but he said : " the best reason for all this change is the best reason there possibly can be : better care for the patient .
" i genuinely believe the best is yet to come with more lives saved , stopping more pain and distress . "
range of reforms meanwhile , two government advisers , sir george alberti and professor roger boyle , have published separate reports arguing the case for reform of services .
what local people want is access to excellent care which they can get to easily professor christopher marks cancer surgeon they set out a pyramid structure whereby super regional hospitals and specialist centres would provide the most complex care , while the second tier includes local hospitals with minor injury units - a scaled down version of a & e - walk-in centres and specialist gp services .
there will also be more of an emphasis on providing care at home and in community settings .
professor boyle , the national director for coronary heart disease , told the bbc : " the message is quite a simple one .
modern medicine moves on , the new technologies need to be made available to everybody , they do require more specialised care , and they require more specialised investigation .
" we have to move the patients to the expertise rather more than we do at the moment . "
the ippr finding is based on data showing how many extra lives could be saved if everyone had access to new techniques to treat heart attacks .
if heart attack care was reconfigured to ensure universal access to emergency angioplasty , around 500 extra lives could be saved every year , it said .
last year only 1,600 of 61,000 heart attack patients were treated in a specialist unit .
some district hospitals are not as safe as they should be and that point has not been effectively made joe farrington-douglas send us your comments also there is evidence that people who have suffered severe injury are more likely to survive if they are treated in specialist centres rather than local hospitals .
the royal college of surgeons and british orthopaedic society estimates that universal access to specialist trauma centres could save around 770 lives a year .
reconfiguring services the ippr researchers said people should be out on the streets campaigning for changes to the way hospitals provide services rather than campaigning to keep traditional services open .
" we 're not saying that hospitals should close , we 're talking about reconfiguring services , " said ippr research fellow joe farrington-douglas .
he said : " the nhs and government should be able to demonstrate how changes will improve care and local people should hold the nhs to account , but they need to understand that preserving the local hospital will not always be in their best interest if something life-threatening happens . "
he added : " some district hospitals are not as safe as they should be and that point has not been effectively made . "
dr jonathan fielden , chairman of the bma 's consultants ' committee said decisions on reconfiguration must be based on " good evidence " .
" it is absolutely right that there is a public debate about the way our health services are delivered in the future and it is vital that patients and clinicians are properly informed and engaged in these discussions , " he said .
case against professor christopher marks , cancer surgeon and chairman of the independent campaign to save the royal surrey hospital in guildford , said : " what local people want is access to excellent care which they can get to easily . "
he accepted that some complicated cases must go to specialist centres , but warned centralisation of services in surrey would see a doubling of minimum ambulance times , which could compromise care .
" thanks to the money that the government has put in , particularly to a & e , the service has improved marvellously , and it is a pity to throw the baby out with the bath water when you have spent all this money . "
dr richard taylor , the independent mp for wyre forest , who campaigned against the closure of his local hospital in kidderminster , admitted that campaigns to save local facilities were driven in some part by emotion .
but he warned that downgrading a & e units left them unable to cope .
" there has got to be compromise that keeps adequate facilities at a wider range of acute general hospitals than these super-specialist centres alone . "

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- chile divided over pinochet illness bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 5 december 2006 , 10:06 gmt chile divided over pinochet illness by daniel schweimler bbc news , santiago supporters have been gathering outside gen pinochet 's hospital a national hero , who saved his country from communist chaos , is fighting for his final breaths after 91 years of dedication to his people .
or is a thieving murderer feigning sickness to dodge the steadily increasing number of human rights and fraud charges being lodged against him ?
chile , as it was during the 17 years of military rule by augusto pinochet and the three years of socialist government that preceded it , is a country divided .
as the former president lies in a military hospital in the capital , santiago , after suffering a heart attack on sunday , his supporters gather outside , waving chilean flags , chanting slogans and placing bronze busts of their hero on the pavement .
motorists beep their horns in support as they drive past .
many are elderly women from the upmarket las condes area .
but others are youngsters who would have little or no memory of the bloody military coup that brought gen pinochet to power in 1973 . "
he left us a country where there was normality , the economy was in good shape and everything was in order " jaime del valle former foreign minister " as a chilean i feel i have to be here to thank general pinochet for all the great things he did for this country .
the country has a short memory and has forgotten many things , " one young woman said .
when i reminded a young man that several charges of human rights abuses and fraud had been brought against the former military leader , he replied : " i know - but he 's still the best thing that ever happened to chile . "
one of a long line of friends and well-wishers to visit gen pinochet in hospital was his former foreign minister jaime del valle .
" he inherited a country in chaos .
there was no order , no food , people were desperate .
it was a very difficult period .
he left us a country where there was normality , the economy was in good shape and everything was in order , " the former minister said .
prosecution moves on sunday , augusto pinochet underwent a surgical procedure to widen a blood vessel .
at one stage a catholic priest was called to give the last rites .
however , since then his doctor , juan ignacio vergara , has given increasingly positive reports of gen pinochet 's progress .
some now question whether the former president was sick at all .
they say he has a habit of falling ill as moves to prosecute him for human rights abuses committed during his 17 years in office gather pace .
the most obvious example came seven years ago .
spanish judge baltasar garzon tried to bring him justice and had him detained in a luxury house outside london for more than a year - only to see gen pinochet sent home after being deemed too sick to stand trial .
shortly after arriving back in santiago he appeared fit and well .
' medical miracle ' on the other side of the city , away from the five-star hotels and designer clothes shops , is the headquarters of the families of disappeared prisoners .
their president , lorena pizarro , sits under a huge poster bearing photographs of some of 3,000 people who were killed under military rule .
" maybe he is sick , " she said .
" but a week ago we saw him celebrate his birthday and he seemed fit and well for a 91 year old .
and we 've seen one medical miracle after another with him , so you have to have your doubts , " she said .
the most controversial issue in chile at the moment is whether augusto pinochet , when he does die , will receive the state funeral normally given to former presidents .
his opponents say he was never elected and with so many legal cases against him , he should not .
the chilean press says that as the former head of the army , he will be given a military funeral .
ms pizarro said : " pinochet is a terrorist and as such he should be allowed to die with his family but without any honours that would legitimise the crimes against humanity he committed . "
the left-wing government of president michelle bachelet , who herself was a prisoner under military rule , has refused to comment , saying it is not appropriate to speak while the former military leader is still alive .
in 1989 , augusto pinochet said : " i 'll go to heaven .
where would i have gone , do you think ?
to hell ?
no , do n't worry , i 'll go to heaven . "
his supporters do n't doubt that for a moment .
his opponents would rather he stuck around for a while longer so augusto pinochet can be tried on this earth .
