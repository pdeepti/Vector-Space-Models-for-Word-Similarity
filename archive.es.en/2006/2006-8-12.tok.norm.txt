program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.08.2006 free business newspaper cautiously enters german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has its first free paper in years free newspapers have established a strong readership across europe , but in germany , ' ' newspaper wars " have scared off competition .
now another publisher is trying to carve out a niche . the latest offering , business news , was launched this week and will be available in eight german markets .
the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .
the makers of business news are being cautious in the paper 's infancy in order .
the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .
axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild-zeitung publisher springer is surely on its toes thanks to business news but bild is keeping an eye on the new market entry , said the university of amsterdam 's piet bakker , an expert on free newspapers in europe .
" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .
" the three in cologne were real war casualties - they fought until 20 minuten died , then the others pulled out , " bakker said .
rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .
in germany , springer 's die welt daily is the only large-selling paper to have followed the trend .
according to the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , based in paris , european readership of free newspapers has doubled over the last three years .
around 19 million of about 28 million free newspapers distributed daily around the world are read by europeans , wan said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german papers face free sheet assault swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .

in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .
brecht 's political works been well received all over the world and have made a particular impact in the developing world .
his influence , however , is not only political . he also introduced a new , austerely empty stage design , intellectually incorporated the audiences in the performance and demanded extreme flexibility from the actors . on the anniversary of his death 50 years ago , dw-world.de offers you this dossier on brecht 's life and international influence . dw-world.de " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world fifty years after his death .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .

the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .

" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .

the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .

' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .

" german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .
-lrb- feb .
10 , 2006 -rrb- finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see .

there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era .

from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .
though the state tried to make a hero out of him , his own politics did n't quite fit in .
in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .
brecht 's political works been well received all over the world and have made a particular impact in the developing world .
his influence , however , is not only political . he also introduced a new , austerely empty stage design , intellectually incorporated the audiences in the performance and demanded extreme flexibility from the actors . on the anniversary of his death 50 years ago , dw-world.de offers you this dossier on brecht 's life and international influence . dw-world.de " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world fifty years after his death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2006 germany welcomes un resolution on lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution calls for 15,000 un peacekeepers to be deployed in lebanon german chancellor angela merkel on saturday welcomed a un resolution calling for an end to the bloodshed in the middle east and urged its " swift and consistent " implementation . " this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .
they will be matched by the 15,000 troops lebanon plans to send to the south .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .
they will be matched by the 15,000 troops lebanon plans to send to the south .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians .

" we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 12.08.2006 bundesliga attempts to continue world cup euphoria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all of germany 's soccer fans turn into bundesliga supporters ?
german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .

it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .

" a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .

" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .

the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .
axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild-zeitung publisher springer is surely on its toes thanks to business news but bild is keeping an eye on the new market entry , said the university of amsterdam 's piet bakker , an expert on free newspapers in europe .
" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .
" the three in cologne were real war casualties - they fought until 20 minuten died , then the others pulled out , " bakker said .
rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .

after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .
though the state tried to make a hero out of him , his own politics did n't quite fit in .
in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .
brecht 's political works been well received all over the world and have made a particular impact in the developing world .
his influence , however , is not only political . he also introduced a new , austerely empty stage design , intellectually incorporated the audiences in the performance and demanded extreme flexibility from the actors . on the anniversary of his death 50 years ago , dw-world.de offers you this dossier on brecht 's life and international influence . dw-world.de " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world fifty years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

11 , 2006 -rrb- berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " the threepenny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .
there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said . " if germany do not win in november against ireland or the czech republic then everything could turn back around , " he said .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said . " if germany do not win in november against ireland or the czech republic then everything could turn back around , " he said .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .

the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment .

" we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian .

now another publisher is trying to carve out a niche . the latest offering , business news , was launched this week and will be available in eight german markets .
the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .
the makers of business news are being cautious in the paper 's infancy in order .
the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .
axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .

" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .

rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .

rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .
in germany , springer 's die welt daily is the only large-selling paper to have followed the trend .
according to the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , based in paris , european readership of free newspapers has doubled over the last three years .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said . " if germany do not win in november against ireland or the czech republic then everything could turn back around , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.08.2006 germany welcomes un resolution on lebanon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the resolution calls for 15,000 un peacekeepers to be deployed in lebanon german chancellor angela merkel on saturday welcomed a un resolution calling for an end to the bloodshed in the middle east and urged its " swift and consistent " implementation . " this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .
they will be matched by the 15,000 troops lebanon plans to send to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian soldiers are prepared to be sent to lebanon as peacekeepers the un force will monitor the cessation of hostilities and any permanent ceasefire and back up lebanese armed forces as they deploy across the region now dominated by hezbollah . the resolution gives the un force the power to " take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces , and as it deems within its capabilities , to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind . " french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said he thought the extra troops could be deployed " very swiftly " .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added .

" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled .

" competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .
they will be matched by the 15,000 troops lebanon plans to send to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian soldiers are prepared to be sent to lebanon as peacekeepers the un force will monitor the cessation of hostilities and any permanent ceasefire and back up lebanese armed forces as they deploy across the region now dominated by hezbollah . the resolution gives the un force the power to " take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces , and as it deems within its capabilities , to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind . " french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said he thought the extra troops could be deployed " very swiftly " .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said . " if germany do not win in november against ireland or the czech republic then everything could turn back around , " he said .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .

in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .

axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild-zeitung publisher springer is surely on its toes thanks to business news but bild is keeping an eye on the new market entry , said the university of amsterdam 's piet bakker , an expert on free newspapers in europe .
" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .
" the three in cologne were real war casualties - they fought until 20 minuten died , then the others pulled out , " bakker said .
rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .
in germany , springer 's die welt daily is the only large-selling paper to have followed the trend .
according to the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , based in paris , european readership of free newspapers has doubled over the last three years .
around 19 million of about 28 million free newspapers distributed daily around the world are read by europeans , wan said . rachel ryan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german papers face free sheet assault swedish company metro appears to be quietly preparing a bid to launch the first free daily paper in germany .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

now another publisher is trying to carve out a niche . the latest offering , business news , was launched this week and will be available in eight german markets .
the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .
the makers of business news are being cautious in the paper 's infancy in order .
the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .
axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild-zeitung publisher springer is surely on its toes thanks to business news but bild is keeping an eye on the new market entry , said the university of amsterdam 's piet bakker , an expert on free newspapers in europe .
" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .
" the three in cologne were real war casualties - they fought until 20 minuten died , then the others pulled out , " bakker said .
rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .
in germany , springer 's die welt daily is the only large-selling paper to have followed the trend .
according to the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , based in paris , european readership of free newspapers has doubled over the last three years .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .

it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .
-lrb- feb .
10 , 2006 -rrb- finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .

" we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .

architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .

on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .
-lrb- feb .
10 , 2006 -rrb- finding traces of the wall in berlin friday marks the 43rd anniversary of the berlin wall 's construction .
recently , the city has rushed to preserve the remains of the cold war symbol for the sake of history and curious tourists .
there 's still plenty to see .
-lrb- aug .
13 , 2004 -rrb- berlin theater deemed safe for friday 's brecht premiere bertolt brecht 's " three penny opera " is supposed to open friday in berlin , 50 years after the playwright 's death .
there 's just one problem : the newly renovated theater is n't safe for the public yet .

but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .

" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era .

from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians . " all members of this council must be aware that this inability to act sooner has badly shaken the world 's faith in its authority and integrity , " he said . lebanon 's acting foreign minister tarek mitri expressed profound doubts about the likelihood of the resolution being able to end the war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has stepped up its airstrikes and continued its incursions across the border more than 1,100 people have been killed in lebanon and more than 900,000 displaced while israel 's bombardments have laid waste to the only international airport , roads , bridges and power stations and effectively cut the country off from the outside world . israel 's ambassador dan gillerman laid the blame for the conflict on lebanon and said the issue would return to the united nations if lebanon failed to implement its side of the proposed ceasefire . thirty-eight israeli civilians and 82 of the country 's soldiers have been killed since the conflict started . rice warns iran and syria in a warning to hezbollah 's main backers , meanwhile , us secretary of state condoleezza rice warned iran and syria to respect the resolution . " we call upon every state , especially iran and syria , to respect the sovereignty of the lebanese government and the will of the international community , " she told the security council .
she also said " hezbollah now faces a clear choice between war and peace " , adding that the resolution " helped to open a path to lasting peace between lebanon and israel . " the text authorizes an increase in the current united interim force in lebanon 's strength to a maximum of 15,000 troops from its current size of about 1,190 troops .
they will be matched by the 15,000 troops lebanon plans to send to the south .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesian soldiers are prepared to be sent to lebanon as peacekeepers the un force will monitor the cessation of hostilities and any permanent ceasefire and back up lebanese armed forces as they deploy across the region now dominated by hezbollah . the resolution gives the un force the power to " take all necessary action in areas of deployment of its forces , and as it deems within its capabilities , to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities of any kind . " french ambassador jean-marc de la sabliere said he thought the extra troops could be deployed " very swiftly " .

" this is an important sign of the international community 's determination to put an end to the military operations , " said the chancellor , whose government has called for a diplomatic solution since the start of the month-old conflict between israel and hezbollah . " now it is a question of implementing the resolution swiftly and consistently , " she added , without saying whether the german army would take part in a united nations force in lebanon . un security council resolution 1701 , drawn up by the united states and france and adopted late friday , calls for an end to the bloodshed between israel and hezbollah .
it also calls for israeli troops to be withdrawn from southern lebanon after an end to the fighting - the timing for which has yet to be agreed with lebanon - and for the deployment of a 15,000-strong international peacekeeping force to prevent further conflict . new israeli offensive just hours after the resolution 's adoption , israeli troops and tanks poured deep into lebanon , on saturday , in a broad " open-ended " offensive . " this operation is aimed at preventing hezbollah from firing rockets into northern israel and is not limited in time , " israeli government spokesman avi pazner said . an army spokesman said the new ground operation , launched after a security cabinet decision last wednesday , could extend up to the strategically important litani river which runs up to 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
one military official said the operation could last weeks and even extend beyond the litani . the litani has served as a strategic limit for israel 's operations in lebanon since it first invaded its northern neighbor in 1978 , leading to a long and bloody occupation that ended only six years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's popularity in israel has fallen as the conflict has continued with israel pursuing its military offensive , prime minister ehud olmert said he would urge his cabinet to accept the security council resolution when it meets sunday , according to a government spokesman .
pazner had said before the resolution was adopted that the military operation " could be stopped at any moment . " the lebanese cabinet was also to meet saturday and us officials said it was expected to accept the resolution , which also calls for the release of two israeli soldiers whose abduction by hezbollah triggered the war on july 12 . annan critical of world powers un secretary general kofi annan criticized the time world powers took to reach a resolution on ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1,200 lives , most of them lebanese civilians .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .

the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .
the makers of business news are being cautious in the paper 's infancy in order .
the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .

" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .

rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .
in germany , springer 's die welt daily is the only large-selling paper to have followed the trend .
according to the world association of newspapers -lrb- wan -rrb- , based in paris , european readership of free newspapers has doubled over the last three years .

now another publisher is trying to carve out a niche . the latest offering , business news , was launched this week and will be available in eight german markets .
the paper was released by publisher holtzbrinck verlag , which also puts out business daily handelsblatt , berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper and business weekly wirtschaftswoche .
the makers of business news are being cautious in the paper 's infancy in order .
the paper was launched during the summer vacation with a circulation of just 80,000 copies .
the paper is only distributed to offices , 1,000 so far .
axel springer , publisher of mass-circulation bild tabloid , was reportedly planning a response to the launch of business news , with the almost immediate release of another competing publication , but no moves have yet been made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild-zeitung publisher springer is surely on its toes thanks to business news but bild is keeping an eye on the new market entry , said the university of amsterdam 's piet bakker , an expert on free newspapers in europe .
" newspaper wars " in cologne attempts to launch free commuter newspapers in germany have been unsuccessful in the past .
in cologne , the introduction of the free daily 20 minuten köln by norwegian publisher schibsted in 2001 sparked a ' ' newspaper war " between the new publication and local publishers .
in retaliation , springer launched köln extra , and dumont schauberg , the publisher of numerous cologne-area papers , started kölner morgen , both free papers .
" the three in cologne were real war casualties - they fought until 20 minuten died , then the others pulled out , " bakker said .
rumors circulated in 2005 that metro , a successful commuter daily distributed in 93 countries across the world , was quietly preparing to launch into the german market , but it still not yet .
a spokeswoman for metro refused to comment on the company 's plans .
metro began in stockholm in 1995 and has grown vastly .
the paper says it has a daily readership of 13.5 million across europe .
the paper 's audience is " the young , affluent , well-educated , metropolitan reader , " who has ' ' largely been lost to the newspaper industry , " the spokeswoman said .
' ' by creating a product that is designed for busy modern lives , metro has been able to deliver the tv demographic on a global basis . "
metro 's success on the european market has been attributed to its compact size , which is easily read on commuter transport , and the editorial content , which offers " light news " more akin to that of europe 's tabloids .
in the meantime , many european papers , particularly in britain , have introduced more formats .

german soccer brass hope to carry the country 's world cup excitement into the domestic league 's season , but the connection between soccer 's biggest event and one of europe 's less exciting leagues remains unclear . excitement about the month-long world cup and the host 's notable third place finish proved germany is indeed a nation of soccer fans .
but now , as the bundesliga begins , many are wondering how much of the world cup elation will carry over to the german league season . " german soccer will definitely get an upswing from the world cup , " national team manager oliver bierhoff said in an interview with sport1.de .
" you can see an increase in interest by the number of season tickets that have been sold . " the bundesliga 's 18 teams sold some 360,000 season tickets before the 2006/07 season started .
all but borussia dortmund ran out of tickets earlier than expected . seeing the stars every week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans wonder if the world cup stars will impress in club jerseys germany , and the world , have seen the quality of bundesliga players , and are interested in seeing how bastian schweinsteiger , miroslav klose and lukas podolski are able to perform after their impressive world cup showings . " why should n't i say that we will profit from the world cup , " bayern munich team manager uli hoeness said in an interview with the munich merkur newspaper .
" with bastian schweinsteiger , lukas podolski , philipp lahm and owen hargreaves , all of whom played well in the world cup , we have absolutely profited from the world cup . " munich has already seen a change in fans ' attitudes during the pre-season , hoeness added . " there was a completely different atmosphere in the stadium recently in the league cup against schalke , " he said .
" the people noticed that it is fun to celebrate and to let go . " bundesliga clubs face different conditions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few clubs can afford the national teams training conditions but letting go can be more difficult without the international players and financial advantages bayern enjoy .
no one in the german leagues can match bayern 's 11 internationals , 10 of whom play for germany , and many are also suffering from economic difficulties that affect neither the national team nor deep-pocketed bayern munich . " a lot of clubs can only dream of having the conditions of the national team , " werder bremen coach thomas schaaf told the tagesspiegel newspaper , adding that he doubted much world cup euphoria could be carried into the league .
" i 've never heard a single national team wish that was not fulfilled . " some of the bundesliga sides , on the other hand , can not afford " simply doing everything that is possible " and have to sell top players or find ways to cut costs , schaaf said . betting on national team is risky business bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beating barcelona and other top european clubs will be difficult for german teams the world cup is also an event of mammoth proportions that eclipses anything else in the world of soccer , while the bundesliga has to fight for attention with the likes of stronger leagues in spain , england and italy , which could lead some fans to wonder if germany is the place to see europe 's best soccer , bierhoff added . " competition at the top of the champions league is very difficult , " he said .
" bayern munich and werder bremen certainly have the possibility and ability to play there , but when you look at how clubs like fc chelsea , fc barcelona and real madrid went shopping on the transfer market , it is going to be very difficult . " using the success of other teams or the national team to promote the domestic league can easily backfire among fickle and demanding spectators , hoeness said . " if germany do not win in november against ireland or the czech republic then everything could turn back around , " he said .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .
though the state tried to make a hero out of him , his own politics did n't quite fit in .
in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .
brecht 's political works been well received all over the world and have made a particular impact in the developing world .
his influence , however , is not only political . he also introduced a new , austerely empty stage design , intellectually incorporated the audiences in the performance and demanded extreme flexibility from the actors . on the anniversary of his death 50 years ago , dw-world.de offers you this dossier on brecht 's life and international influence . dw-world.de " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world fifty years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

"
but when brecht himself tried to become a hollywood screenwriter , he failed miserably . " i saw brecht , " composer kurt weil wrote to his wife lotte lenya from hollywood on oct .
1 , 1942 .
" he was just as dirty and unshaven as ever , but somehow much nicer and rather pathetic . " german poet and playwright bertold brecht - author of " the threepenny opera " -lrb- 1928 -rrb- and " the rise and fall of the city of mahagonny " -lrb- 1930 -rrb- - came to california in 1941 as part of what one scholar called " that spectacular migration of art , culture , and intellect from germany during the hitler era . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood was for brecht a " marketplace of lies " during the six years of his californian exile , the cigar-smoking stalinist in unfashionable baggy pants , who spoke broken english with a heavy german accent , spent most of his time desperately trying to become a hollywood screenwriter .
from 1941 to 1947 , he worked on more than 50 scripts and script ideas . that some of them failed to be developed could surely be blamed on hollywood 's myopic understanding of what makes a good movie .
for others , however , such as brecht 's idea to turn " the communist manifesto " into a cinematic epic , the problem had more to do with brecht 's rather tenuous connection with the american reality . the stuff that capitalist dreams are made of bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht 's wife helen weigel in the role of mother courage it should really come as no surprise that brecht never made it in hollywood .
hollywood was then , as it is now , a big business .
the simple truth that it is money - not dreams - that make the world go around was as pertinent in the epoch of rita hayworth as it is in the age of julia roberts . the audiences always wanted adventures with guns and romance rather than experiments in estrangement and anti-capitalist tantrums .
this is exactly why hollywood is to this day one of the greatest inventions of the capitalist system : a bitter ideological anesthetic disguised as an ice-cream sundae . german émigrés participated as actors , producers , screenwriters or directors in approximately one third of the 180 anti-nazi films which were made in the united states between 1939 and 1946 .
only one screenplay , however , that brecht worked on ever made it to the hollywood screen . a fight over the script bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brecht worked with " metropolis " director fritz lang in 1943 brecht worked together with a more experienced hollywood screenwriter , john wexley , on the script for a 1943 fritz lang movie " hangmen also die . "
the movie revolved around the assassination of the nazi governor of bohemia and moravia reinhard heydrich , which took place in 1942 , and the subsequent nazi reprisals . brecht - whose journals are filled with pages describing his frustration with the movie - was in the end not even credited for the screenplay , but only for the idea that the film was based on .
his attempts to get the screenwriter 's guild to arbiter between him and his american co-writer ended in embarrassment because brecht could provide no material evidence that he wrote any portion of the script . " every day , to earn my bread , i go to the marketplace , where lies are sold , " brecht wrote in 1941 . abrasive and authoritarian yet there is a fine line separating a wronged genius from a petulant child .
most people who met brecht during his difficult years in the united states were less than impressed .
poet w. h. auden , who collaborated with brecht on adapting webster 's " the duchess of malfi " for broadway , thought brecht was " an odious person , " while theatre critic eric bentley described him as a scoundrel " without elementary decency . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas mann described brecht as " very gifted , unfortunately , " " a monster , " and " a party liner " because of his abrasive and authoritarian personality , brecht made no friends across the atlantic .
if anything helped him survive those difficult years , it was his unshakable and unflinching belief in his own greatness . brecht 's relationship with the german emigration was no less tempestuous .
theodor adorno - sociologist , philosopher and prominent member of the frankfurt school of neo-marxist social theory - wrote that " brecht spends two hours a day pushing dirt under his fingernails to make himself look proletarian . " brecht , in turn , referred to members of the frankfurt schools as " mandarins , " " cultural elitists , " and " prostituted intellectuals " whose " major revolutionary duty was to preserve the institute 's money . " brecht was a sincere believer in art as propaganda - not as mirror held up to reality , but " a hammer with which to shape it . "
that is why there was really no way for him - a practitioner of anti-illusionist estrangement in the theatre - to become accepted in a city built on the idea of turning chimeras into cash . for brecht , hollywood was merely an epitome of the hypnotic capitalist machinery and his american period - a time of loneliness and cultural isolation .
for hollywood , on the other hand , brecht was simply a shabby , bad tempered and ill-mannered communist who lost his way in the city of angels .
it was a mismatch of almost mythic proportions . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing bertolt brecht 's spirit back to berlin a touch of 1920s glamor will return to berlin this summer when the admiralspalast theater dusts off its marble columns and reopens its doors with a production of bertolt brecht 's biggest hit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on berlin berliners celebrate new shopping hours " poor but sexy berlin " offers five-star hotels on the cheap looking forward to a smoke-free berlin questions arise about the future of " sexy but poor " berlin history -pipe- 12.08.2006 berlin 's friedrichstrasse : where city 's history played out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrichstrasse and its train station have been central to berlin - in good times and bad from suburban street to business and entertainment district to stage for a cold war standoff , berlin 's friedrichstrasse has played many roles in the city 's history .
dw-world takes a stroll down this storied street . one needs a vivid imagination to peel back some of the thick layers of history that cover friedrichstrasse and have a look inside .
it also helps to have a history book . the street , one of berlin 's most famous , has been convulsed by events , and even by bombs , that have befallen the city .
they 've never killed its spirit , but they have sent it staggering .
still , the street always seems to get up , dust itself off and get back to business - kind of like the city itself . friedrichstrasse 's 3.5-kilometer -lrb- two-mile -rrb- north-south route runs through the heart of the city , and it 's been said that the street sums up berlin - with its highs and lows , glitter and grit - better than any other thoroughfare . shabby south today 's street has a rather humble beginning at its southern end .
the square called mehringplatz was known as the rondell in the early 18th century , when friedrichstadt , the district around friedrichstrasse , was first constructed outside the city walls .
the rondell was a circular plaza modeled on rome 's piazza del popolo , whose column in the center marked the southeastern limit of the city 's extension .
it was a quiet area ; the peace of the bourgeois homes that lined the suburban idyll were not much disturbed save for the occasional regiments who drilled on the rondell 's parade grounds . a few centuries , and much development , later , friedrichstrasse 's southern end found itself reduced by world war ii bombing raids to a field of mud , populated only with a few skeletal remains of bombed-out buildings .
sixty years after that , it has yet to fully bounce back from that particular stroke of fate . mehringplatz has kept its circular form thanks to two massive , joyless apartment blocks built in ring form around the plaza , but comparisons with the eternal city 's famous circular square end there .
concrete and a late-sixties design aesthetic are the dominant motifs here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checkpoint charlie - a copy of a western guardhouse has been set up for tourists beginning the walk north , the signs are also not auspicious .
a few ethnic food markets , a down-at-heel internet café and " for lease " signs in empty store windows reflect the economic difficulty this part of town still finds itself in . checkpoint charlie but two blocks up , at kochstrasse , the scene changes dramatically as you reach the spot that put the street in the global spotlight .
on oct .
27 , 1961 , just over two months after the berlin wall split the city in two , us and soviet tanks found themselves facing off at the checkpoint charlie crossing point from west to east berlin , which had been established where the barrier cut friedrichstrasse in two . both tanks had live ammunition on board , and both had orders to return fire if fired upon .
from 5 p.m. on oct .
27 until 11 a.m. the next morning , two worldviews tried to stare each other down .
the resolution was peaceful , if uneasy , and it cemented friedrichstrasse 's place in cold war history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : that 's all that 's left of the berlin wall in most parts of the city today , the wall is gone , only a trail of bricks embedded in the pavement and sidewalk trace the path of the former barrier .
the barbed wire has disappeared , but the memories remain , and a stop at the privately run house at checkpoint charlie museum is a must for most tourists . now instead of soldiers standing with rifles ready , vendors hawk faux eastern military paraphernalia , and actors dressed up in military uniforms pose for photographs in front of a mock-up of a guardhouse , complete with sandbags . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists read the history of the city 's cold war division cafés and souvenir shops line the street instead of boarded up windows and slightly nervous western tourists preparing to hand their passports to east german border guards before crossing over to the gdr .
today 's tourists fill their time reading the new information panels that have gone up explaining the history of the city 's division . pull out your credit cards wandering further north , and crossing into what was once east berlin , friedrichstrasse starts regaining some of the glitter that made it berlin 's traditional business and entertainment center .
after reunification , money was poured into refurbishment projects to rebuild and renovate where east german neglect had left its mark . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the area around französiche strasse has become the street 's upmarket shopping district at the beginning of the 20th century , the street was a bustling marketplace , especially for gold and precious gems .
there were fashionable restaurants , hotels , business headquarters and banks .
it was the city 's pleasure palace , not only because it was called the " street of 107 cinemas , " but also because of the many prostitutes who plied their trade here . while businesspeople in the heady years after reunification might not have had the return of the working girls in mind , they did hope to bring back some of the street 's economic vitality .
architects flexed their imaginations as glittering new buildings went up and developers waited eagerly for the expected onslaught of tenants .
the hordes did not come . more than 1.1 million square feet -lrb- 100,000 square meters -rrb- of upscale retail space was built in friedrichstrasse in the 1990s .
but much of it has remained unleased and original rent estimates on price per square meter have fallen by half . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not for the faint of heart , or weak of credit card still , the upscale boutiques and department stores moved in - louis vuitton , gucci , galleries lafayette , bang & olufsen , to name just a few - and as germany 's economy has begun to recover , they 're filling up again -lrb- even though without the nouveau riche russian tourists , many might have a hard time staying in business -rrb- . historic photographs of the street show casual strollers , elegantly dressed women and office clerks jostling one another on the narrow sidewalks as trams and horse-drawn buses rolled by .
now , the scene has almost come full circle , keeping with the times .
today , tourists , wealthy matrons and besuited professionals weave and dodge one another as modern vehicles ply the road , surprisingly narrow for such an important artery , and often jammed up . sluice between two worlds further north , friedrichstrasse crosses berlin 's grand unter den linden boulevard and then meets the train station that bears its name .
built in 1882 , it was soon the capital 's most important station although during cold war , it became a symbol for the partition of the country and the separation of families on two sides of the ideological divide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene of many a sorrowful farewell - the " palace of tears " then , what had been a through station became a terminus for travelers from the two sections of the city .
it was the only link for mainline , suburban and underground trains and a sluice between the two worlds .
westerners could use the station , although it was in east berlin , since several western suburban rail -lrb- s-bahn -rrb- and underground lines used it .
they could transfer between lines without leaving the station . those germans with the right papers could enter east berlin here , going though a customs hall that - due to many sad farewells visiting westerners had to bid family and friends here - became known as the " palace of tears " -lrb- tränenpalast -rrb- . after unification , the tränenpalast became a popular events venue .
but , in another sign of berlin 's continuing transformation , it has hosted its last concert and will be torn down for a multi-story office building that will take its place . party row a century ago , the most northern section of friedrichstrasse , just over the spree river , was a lively bar and club district .
almost every second building housed some sort of entertainment venue , including numerous brothels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north of the river , friedrichstrasse traditionally really got fun since the 19th century the area has attracted theater fans , drawn to the dense conglomeration of stages in the areas .
the options run from high-concept and classical works at the berliner ensemble - founded by playwright bertold brecht in the 1950s to present his plays - to political cabaret at the distel theater , all the way to lighter fare at the friedrichstadtpalast , where the costumes and spectacle take center stage . friedrichstrasse ends a few blocks further north , amid cafés , pubs and scaffolding as the street continues its long makeover .
it stops at oranienburger tor , a gateway to another nightlife district that came into its own after the wall tumbled .
it 's mostly favored by tourists these days ; berlin residents have largely moved on to other neighborhoods . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's friedrichstadtpalast some have called friedrichstrasse berlin 's own champs-elysées .
the comparison seems inaccurate , although that is not meant to belittle the german thoroughfare .
true , friedrichstrasse lacks the grandeur and classical beauty of the parisian boulevard , but it makes up for it in its history , its sheer variety and its phoenix-like rise from the ashes of war and communist neglect . like berlin , it has often been on the losing side of history and has the scars to show for it .
but also like berlin , it has emerged from the trauma of the 20th century perhaps a little shaky on its feet , but determined to find its place in the 21st . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in berlin , another communist-era building bites the dust once a popular choice for distinguished guests of the east german government , the hotel unter den linden in central berlin is now the latest soviet-style building to be slated for demolition .

born in the bavarian city of augsburg , the disappointment and persecution he experienced in nazi germany and western capitalist society brought him to communist east germany .
though the state tried to make a hero out of him , his own politics did n't quite fit in .
in his more famous works like " the threepenny opera , " " mother courage and her children , " and " the good woman of szechuan , " but also in dozens of other plays and musicals , brecht challenges both the actors and the audience to view their world in a whole new way .
brecht 's political works been well received all over the world and have made a particular impact in the developing world .
his influence , however , is not only political . he also introduced a new , austerely empty stage design , intellectually incorporated the audiences in the performance and demanded extreme flexibility from the actors . on the anniversary of his death 50 years ago , dw-world.de offers you this dossier on brecht 's life and international influence . dw-world.de dw-world : " bertolt brecht 's influence can not be overestimated " bertolt brecht 's dramas continue to touch audiences and spark political criticism around the world fifty years after his death .
he carped on capitalism and did n't mesh with the gdr - most importantly , he entertained .

japanese knotweed , a particularly invasive species , can kill other plants and grows through concrete and tarmac to damage pavements and buildings .
the environment agency said the " unbelievably strong " plant caused concern and had to be controlled .
it is illegal to grow knotweed in the wild and offenders can be imprisoned .
alistair driver , the agency 's national conservation manager , said : " it 's unbelievably strong .
it can actually grow through concrete and through brick walls .

and that 's a really serious problem in some parts of the country , like for example , the swansea area and down in cornwall . "
flourishing in any soil - however poor - japanese knotweed spreads relentlessly , overwhelming other plants and damaging ecosystems .
experts say a new plant can grow from a piece of root the size of a garden pea .
billion-pound cost the victorians introduced the plant to the uk from japan but many dug it up and threw it out .
it then spread in the wild after starting to overtake gardens .
the problem is now so great the government has estimated that controlling the weed countrywide would cost £ 1.56bn.
and the removal of knotweed from the 2012 olympic site in east london could cost hundreds of thousands of pounds .

in an open letter they say british policy is putting civilians at increased risk in the uk and abroad .
this is the text .
prime minister , as british muslims we urge you to do more to fight against all those who target civilians with violence , whenever and wherever that happens .
it is our view that current british government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in the uk and abroad .
to combat terror the government has focused extensively on domestic legislation .
while some of this will have an impact , the government must not ignore the role of its foreign policy .
the debacle of iraq and now the failure to do more to secure an immediate end to the attacks on civilians in the middle east not only increases the risk to ordinary people in that region , it is also ammunition to extremists who threaten us all .
attacking civilians is never justified .
this message is a global one .
we urge the prime minister to redouble his efforts to tackle terror and extremism and change our foreign policy to show the world that we value the lives of civilians wherever they live and whatever their religion .
such a move would make us all safer .

this is the text .
prime minister , as british muslims we urge you to do more to fight against all those who target civilians with violence , whenever and wherever that happens .
it is our view that current british government policy risks putting civilians at increased risk both in the uk and abroad .
to combat terror the government has focused extensively on domestic legislation .
while some of this will have an impact , the government must not ignore the role of its foreign policy .
the debacle of iraq and now the failure to do more to secure an immediate end to the attacks on civilians in the middle east not only increases the risk to ordinary people in that region , it is also ammunition to extremists who threaten us all .
attacking civilians is never justified .
