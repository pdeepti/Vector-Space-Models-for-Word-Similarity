" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .
given the current political and economic crises , the continuation of the patriarchal society represents an immeasurable strategy of risk . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .
" the left party will probably become a stable element of the german party system , because they enjoy advantages of dimension , " said holtmann . " but ... the history of the german system reveals that former efforts to found and consolidate competing parties left of the spd have failed ...
it 's not quite clear yet , what will happen .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .
" the left party will probably become a stable element of the german party system , because they enjoy advantages of dimension , " said holtmann . " but ... the history of the german system reveals that former efforts to found and consolidate competing parties left of the spd have failed ...
it 's not quite clear yet , what will happen .

" good relations between poland and germany are important for all of europe , " kaczynski told reporters after their meeting , adding that he was " deeply convinced " that berlin and warsaw needed close ties . merkel told reporters the two leaders would discuss international relations and the future of the european union during a working lunch . disagreements over eu constitution both leaders openly disagree on the eu constitution , which the german chancellor wants to help revive after it was rejected by french and dutch voters and put on ice by the bloc . kaczynski , in an interview with wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , reiterated his view that the treaty needed to be re-drafted . " we need a new constitution for europe , " he told the newspaper , adding that the current draft " is no longer relevant . " the handelsblatt newspaper commented that fostering better ties between poland and germany was essential to resolving the standoff on the constitution as poland is the heavyweight among the newer eu members while germany is seen as brussels ' bridge to the newcomers which swelled the bloc to 25 members . discussing energy , baltic sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea pipeline wo n't cross poland merkel and kaczynski were widely expected to talk about eu energy policy , which has become another sore point in relations between the two neighbors . poland has been urging an accord within the eu to secure the bloc 's energy supply , but germany is skeptical about the proposal . warsaw was outraged by an agreement signed between germany and russia last september to build a gas pipeline across the baltic sea , bypassing poland and depriving it of lucrative transit fees . anti-german feelings ties between poland and its main trade partner were further strained when kaczynski sought to exploit lingering anti-german sentiment during his campaign for the presidency . the tactic was seen by some observers as having contributed to his victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were expelled from poland after world war ii the polish president has also opposed plans to build a controversial center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from polish territory after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of poland . kaczynski was due to meet with president horst köhler and the speaker of the lower house of the german parliament , norbert lammert , later on wednesday . he will also deliver a speech at humboldt university in berlin and meet poles living in germany during his two-day visit . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on expellees to open in germany a group representing germans expelled at the end of world war ii from countries once occupied by the nazis , has unveiled plans for an exhibition in berlin despite a raging debate on its focus .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .

what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .

but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 opinion : women on top ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gender equality is still lacking in germany it may be international women 's day , but how far have women come in the battle for equality of the sexes ?
more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .
given the current political and economic crises , the continuation of the patriarchal society represents an immeasurable strategy of risk . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .
here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.03.2006 fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of soccer fans will have to contend with watching the games in a pub how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a danish flag burning " nowadays it appears that even christians need to be protected , " wrote carmen böker , of the berliner zeitung . editorialists , following böker 's sarcastic reaction , have slammed the decision .
kai müller at the tagesspiegel compared rtl 's decision to the decision of the bishopric of brno in the czech republic .
following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .
as they wrote the song , they mulled the many forms of deification in society today , they said in a statement on their web site .
they claimed they wanted to criticize the church as well as take aim at the pop stars celebrated by the media and fans as " new gods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake popstars as " new gods " singer dero said that the decision to ban the performance was a curious one by a society so ready to demand tolerance from other religions . " on the one hand , we in the west demand from those of other faiths that they be more accepting of critical perspectives of their religion , " he wrote .
" on the other hand , we counter an attitude in our country that completely contradicts this . " mohammed controversy , it is n't despite the back and forth , the issue is n't likely to prompt the intellectual and high-octane debate sparked by the mohammed cartoons , at least according to some commentators . " this , " wrote the left-wing taz newspaper , " is about a below average band , with a less than original song , the banning of which a substandard broadcaster hopes will spark a little interest in a bleak event .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter .

turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

" good relations between poland and germany are important for all of europe , " kaczynski told reporters after their meeting , adding that he was " deeply convinced " that berlin and warsaw needed close ties . merkel told reporters the two leaders would discuss international relations and the future of the european union during a working lunch . disagreements over eu constitution both leaders openly disagree on the eu constitution , which the german chancellor wants to help revive after it was rejected by french and dutch voters and put on ice by the bloc . kaczynski , in an interview with wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , reiterated his view that the treaty needed to be re-drafted . " we need a new constitution for europe , " he told the newspaper , adding that the current draft " is no longer relevant . " the handelsblatt newspaper commented that fostering better ties between poland and germany was essential to resolving the standoff on the constitution as poland is the heavyweight among the newer eu members while germany is seen as brussels ' bridge to the newcomers which swelled the bloc to 25 members . discussing energy , baltic sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea pipeline wo n't cross poland merkel and kaczynski were widely expected to talk about eu energy policy , which has become another sore point in relations between the two neighbors . poland has been urging an accord within the eu to secure the bloc 's energy supply , but germany is skeptical about the proposal . warsaw was outraged by an agreement signed between germany and russia last september to build a gas pipeline across the baltic sea , bypassing poland and depriving it of lucrative transit fees . anti-german feelings ties between poland and its main trade partner were further strained when kaczynski sought to exploit lingering anti-german sentiment during his campaign for the presidency . the tactic was seen by some observers as having contributed to his victory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans were expelled from poland after world war ii the polish president has also opposed plans to build a controversial center of remembrance in berlin for germans who were expelled from polish territory after the war in reprisal for the nazi invasion of poland . kaczynski was due to meet with president horst köhler and the speaker of the lower house of the german parliament , norbert lammert , later on wednesday . he will also deliver a speech at humboldt university in berlin and meet poles living in germany during his two-day visit . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial exhibition on expellees to open in germany a group representing germans expelled at the end of world war ii from countries once occupied by the nazis , has unveiled plans for an exhibition in berlin despite a raging debate on its focus .

23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.03.2006 fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of soccer fans will have to contend with watching the games in a pub how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .

" since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a danish flag burning " nowadays it appears that even christians need to be protected , " wrote carmen böker , of the berliner zeitung . editorialists , following böker 's sarcastic reaction , have slammed the decision .
kai müller at the tagesspiegel compared rtl 's decision to the decision of the bishopric of brno in the czech republic .
following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .
as they wrote the song , they mulled the many forms of deification in society today , they said in a statement on their web site .
they claimed they wanted to criticize the church as well as take aim at the pop stars celebrated by the media and fans as " new gods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake popstars as " new gods " singer dero said that the decision to ban the performance was a curious one by a society so ready to demand tolerance from other religions . " on the one hand , we in the west demand from those of other faiths that they be more accepting of critical perspectives of their religion , " he wrote .
" on the other hand , we counter an attitude in our country that completely contradicts this . " mohammed controversy , it is n't despite the back and forth , the issue is n't likely to prompt the intellectual and high-octane debate sparked by the mohammed cartoons , at least according to some commentators . " this , " wrote the left-wing taz newspaper , " is about a below average band , with a less than original song , the banning of which a substandard broadcaster hopes will spark a little interest in a bleak event .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .

following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.03.2006 after september triumph , new left falters in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still strong - but for how long ?
riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .

" their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .
" the left party will probably become a stable element of the german party system , because they enjoy advantages of dimension , " said holtmann . " but ... the history of the german system reveals that former efforts to found and consolidate competing parties left of the spd have failed ...

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .

is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action .

in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .
" we are and will remain obliged to work towards a diplomatic solution and the referral to the un security council does not spell an end to diplomacy , on the contrary , " he said at a press conference in berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea chief sees possible breakthrough in iran standoff mohamed elbaradei , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief , raised hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with iran monday when he announced a deal that would let tehran pursue some atomic research .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .

the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

" they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 europe searching for a better energy strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say europe 's transportation sector is n't energy efficient enough facing rapidly dwindling energy supplies and a precarious dependence on energy from abroad , the european union urged countries to rethink their energy policies in a report released on wednesday . joined by the european energy commissioner , eu commission head jose manuel barroso chided european countries for being too nationalistic in the energy sector , and not working hard enough to find a common eu approach to the continent 's approaching energy crisis .
" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 europe searching for a better energy strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say europe 's transportation sector is n't energy efficient enough facing rapidly dwindling energy supplies and a precarious dependence on energy from abroad , the european union urged countries to rethink their energy policies in a report released on wednesday . joined by the european energy commissioner , eu commission head jose manuel barroso chided european countries for being too nationalistic in the energy sector , and not working hard enough to find a common eu approach to the continent 's approaching energy crisis .
" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .

moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .
given the current political and economic crises , the continuation of the patriarchal society represents an immeasurable strategy of risk . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .
given the current political and economic crises , the continuation of the patriarchal society represents an immeasurable strategy of risk . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 08.03.2006 fans crave world cup tickets for ride to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of soccer fans will have to contend with watching the games in a pub how do i get a ticket for the world cup ?
that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .
-lrb- march 7 , 2006 -rrb- germany welcomes the wealthy world the 2006 world cup may be billed as a tournament for everyone but it seems that those who have very healthy bank accounts will get the best seats when the global soccer spectacle kicks off in june next year .
-lrb- nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 turkey 's reform efforts wane großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu flag becoming less likely to fly constantly in turkey ?
turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a danish flag burning " nowadays it appears that even christians need to be protected , " wrote carmen böker , of the berliner zeitung . editorialists , following böker 's sarcastic reaction , have slammed the decision .
kai müller at the tagesspiegel compared rtl 's decision to the decision of the bishopric of brno in the czech republic .
following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .
as they wrote the song , they mulled the many forms of deification in society today , they said in a statement on their web site .
they claimed they wanted to criticize the church as well as take aim at the pop stars celebrated by the media and fans as " new gods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake popstars as " new gods " singer dero said that the decision to ban the performance was a curious one by a society so ready to demand tolerance from other religions . " on the one hand , we in the west demand from those of other faiths that they be more accepting of critical perspectives of their religion , " he wrote .
" on the other hand , we counter an attitude in our country that completely contradicts this . " mohammed controversy , it is n't despite the back and forth , the issue is n't likely to prompt the intellectual and high-octane debate sparked by the mohammed cartoons , at least according to some commentators . " this , " wrote the left-wing taz newspaper , " is about a below average band , with a less than original song , the banning of which a substandard broadcaster hopes will spark a little interest in a bleak event .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .
" we are and will remain obliged to work towards a diplomatic solution and the referral to the un security council does not spell an end to diplomacy , on the contrary , " he said at a press conference in berlin . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iaea chief sees possible breakthrough in iran standoff mohamed elbaradei , the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief , raised hopes of a breakthrough in the nuclear standoff with iran monday when he announced a deal that would let tehran pursue some atomic research .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter .

but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .

the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.03.2006 green light for german atomic waste facility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the konrad site could be ready for waste storage in five years a german court on wednesday gave the go-ahead for the construction of a storage facility for low- and medium-level radioactive nuclear waste , putting an end to a two-decade-long campaign to block the project . a german court in lower saxony on wednesday overturned lawsuits aimed at preventing a former iron ore mine in the town of salzgitter from being converted into a permanent storage facility for nuclear waste .
the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .
the konrad site will be capable of storing up to 300,000 tons of low- and medium-grade radioactive waste produced by hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry , for example . no solution for reactor waste in sight the facility in salzgitter will not be used to store the highly radioactive waste from atomic energy plants - that will continue to go to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gorleben storage facility has met with fierce resistance following the nuclear phase-out agreement struck by the former coalition government , investigations into the suitability of gorleben 's salt domes for long-term nuclear waste storage were called off , and the site 's future remains uncertain . the german environmental protection ngo bund has called on federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to halt construction at the konrad site until the government has agreed on a permanent storage solution for all of germany 's nuclear waste . " since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .
she added that , contrary to statements from the state environment ministry , the konrad site lacks the long-term security to make it a suitable permanent storage facility . " the evidence for the site 's long-term security no longer reflects current scientific knowledge , " backhaus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal environment minister gabriel sigmar following the court 's decision on wednesday , environment minister gabriel said he shared in the criticism of the konrad site project and called for consensus on a general nuclear waste storage solution for germany . he added that while the konrad mine could be used to store 90 percent of the waste volume , it would " only account for 10 percent of the radioactivity in germany . " 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .

" it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .

more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .

what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 europe searching for a better energy strategy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say europe 's transportation sector is n't energy efficient enough facing rapidly dwindling energy supplies and a precarious dependence on energy from abroad , the european union urged countries to rethink their energy policies in a report released on wednesday . joined by the european energy commissioner , eu commission head jose manuel barroso chided european countries for being too nationalistic in the energy sector , and not working hard enough to find a common eu approach to the continent 's approaching energy crisis .
" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 turkey 's reform efforts wane großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the eu flag becoming less likely to fly constantly in turkey ?
turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said . " the eu must not let a small anti-turkish faction dominate its policy in that respect , " he said . sonja lindenberg -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief , doubts as eu , turkey clinch deal the last-ditch deal between the eu and turkey on the latter 's membership bid has triggered relief among the bloc 's negotiators and joy in turkey , but deep skepticism still persists in conservative camps .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action .

in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .

" lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .

what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .

more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .

but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .

for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .

in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .

23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line .

for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .

" it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .

in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .

" 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.03.2006 german rock under fire for god song großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oomph ! takes aim at the church in " god is a popstar " europe 's mohammed cartoon controversy has claimed a german rock band as its latest victim .
germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .

germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a danish flag burning " nowadays it appears that even christians need to be protected , " wrote carmen böker , of the berliner zeitung . editorialists , following böker 's sarcastic reaction , have slammed the decision .
kai müller at the tagesspiegel compared rtl 's decision to the decision of the bishopric of brno in the czech republic .
following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .
as they wrote the song , they mulled the many forms of deification in society today , they said in a statement on their web site .
they claimed they wanted to criticize the church as well as take aim at the pop stars celebrated by the media and fans as " new gods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake popstars as " new gods " singer dero said that the decision to ban the performance was a curious one by a society so ready to demand tolerance from other religions . " on the one hand , we in the west demand from those of other faiths that they be more accepting of critical perspectives of their religion , " he wrote .
" on the other hand , we counter an attitude in our country that completely contradicts this . " mohammed controversy , it is n't despite the back and forth , the issue is n't likely to prompt the intellectual and high-octane debate sparked by the mohammed cartoons , at least according to some commentators . " this , " wrote the left-wing taz newspaper , " is about a below average band , with a less than original song , the banning of which a substandard broadcaster hopes will spark a little interest in a bleak event .

in germany , the swearing in of angela merkel , the country 's first female chancellor , marked a triumph for women 's rights .
but even in the european union 's largest economy , the fairer sex has failed to replicate that success in the business world - the boardroom still remains a boys ' club .

dw-world has compiled a dossier on the issues hindering the progress of women in germany . dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .

that is the key question soccer fans are asking ahead of this summer 's spectacle in germany .
the answer , however , may not be one they want to hear . the german organizers of the upcoming soccer world cup made 3.07 million tickets available to the general public , but demand has far outstripped supply with tickets oversubscribed by a ratio of 20 to one .
the first 12 hours of sales alone saw one million tickets ordered with 90 percent of the orders coming from europe . the organizing committee confirmed that 2.7 million tickets had already been snapped up 100 days before the finals , running from june 9 until july 9 , ensuring a frantic scramble for the remaining 370,000 tickets . fans urged to go through proper channels germany 's central european location and its numerous borders make it easily accessible and thousands of fans will travel to germany in the hope of securing a late ticket through a friend , contact or via ' improper ' channels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black market tickets have already emerged on ebay black market tickets have surfaced on online auction site ebay and ticket touts are sure to be hovering around the 12 world cup stadiums come june . organizers have urged fans to go through the proper channels with organizing committee deputy head horst r. schmidt saying fans risk being left out of pocket if they gamble on the black market . " they should realize that they could not only lose a great deal of money , but also might find themselves unable to enter the ground on match day due to the personalized nature of the tickets , " schmidt warned . the official world cup web site , www.fifaworldcup.com , and the 2006 fifa world cup ticketing center in frankfurt are the two proper channels . but deep pockets are required , with group matches ranging from 35 to 100 euros -lrb- $ 42-120 -rrb- , while a ticket for the berlin final costs between 120 and 600 euros . " tickets can not be forged " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of hopeful fans are in for a huge disappointment at the world cup the prices of tickets on the black market are sure to be hiked up significantly and aside from the agony of parting with hundreds of euros a high-tech system could see black-market buyers turned away at the turnstiles . fifa have confirmed that no one is permitted to re-sell or hand over a match ticket without the approval of organizers .
all tickets for the 64 world cup matches have an embedded electronic chip to identify the ticket holder and counter illegal trading . " the tickets can not be forged , " promised wolfgang niersbach of the world cup organizing committee . the tickets are printed in english with only the public transportation details in german .
the name of the football fan who purchased the ticket is also displayed . allegations of foul play three of the five ticket sales periods have already been completed and the ongoing penultimate sales stage ends on april 15 .
the final sales period runs from may 1 to july 9 .
providing the fans have applied in time , they enter an electronic lottery that determines the lucky recipients .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even world cup mascot goleo wo n't be able to ease fans ' disappointment however , three of the five sales periods , including the final two , are being done on a ' first come , first served ' basis and the confusing system has come under fire from fans .
only being able to pay with a card issued by world cup sponsors mastercard - unless you have a german bank account - and curt e-mails informing the customer of failed attempts are just some of the grievances . there have also been complaints about the number of vip tickets being allocated . a government report leaked in bild newspaper on monday confirmed that 79 german politicians and high-ranking civil servants would be provided with tickets for all 64 matches at the finals . fifa president sepp blatter has also criticized the complex lottery-style system and promised a change for the 2010 world cup in south africa . soaking up the frenzy in a pub a ticket for this summer 's world cup is almost like a winning lottery ticket .
the tickets are supposed to be delivered to recipients six to eight weeks before the world cup . for those who fail to get their hands on the coveted stubs , soaking up the atmosphere in a german pub fitted out with a widescreen television is the logical alternative . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de beckenbauer scolds germany 's klinsmann just days after criticism rained down following the 1-4 loss to italy , germany coach jürgen klinsmann was reprimanded by soccer king franz beckenbauer for skipping an important meeting of world cup coaches in germany .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .
the konrad site will be capable of storing up to 300,000 tons of low- and medium-grade radioactive waste produced by hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry , for example . no solution for reactor waste in sight the facility in salzgitter will not be used to store the highly radioactive waste from atomic energy plants - that will continue to go to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gorleben storage facility has met with fierce resistance following the nuclear phase-out agreement struck by the former coalition government , investigations into the suitability of gorleben 's salt domes for long-term nuclear waste storage were called off , and the site 's future remains uncertain . the german environmental protection ngo bund has called on federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to halt construction at the konrad site until the government has agreed on a permanent storage solution for all of germany 's nuclear waste . " since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .
she added that , contrary to statements from the state environment ministry , the konrad site lacks the long-term security to make it a suitable permanent storage facility . " the evidence for the site 's long-term security no longer reflects current scientific knowledge , " backhaus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal environment minister gabriel sigmar following the court 's decision on wednesday , environment minister gabriel said he shared in the criticism of the konrad site project and called for consensus on a general nuclear waste storage solution for germany . he added that while the konrad mine could be used to store 90 percent of the waste volume , it would " only account for 10 percent of the radioactivity in germany . " 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter . " in the second half of 2006 , the big cyprus dispute will happen , " kramer said , adding that cypriot greeks could manage to have membership negotiations ended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriot turks said evet , or yes , to unification with the greek part of the island turkey meanwhile is accusing the eu of double standards .
turks can not understand why the greek part of the island was admitted to the eu even though it opposed a unification proposal by the un in 2004 .
another proposal by gül was also rejected by the greek side in late january .
ankara on the hand continues to refuse opening its borders for cypriot ships and planes . the eu has been trying to mediate in the conflict and has paid 139 million euros -lrb- $ 165.6 million -rrb- in aid to cypriot turks - albeit two years late .
but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .
to prevent this , the turkish part of cyprus should receive more support , steinbach said .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity europe -pipe- 08.03.2006 opinion : women on top ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gender equality is still lacking in germany it may be international women 's day , but how far have women come in the battle for equality of the sexes ?
more programs are needed for women to influence society on all levels , says dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning . for a few months now , liberia , germany and chile have had something new in common - women were recently elected to head their governments .
it 's difficult to directly compare either the three countries or the three women that rule them .
the heads of state are comparable mainly in the expectations brought to bear on them by the public .
they are all expected to make progress on exactly those issues where their male predecessors failed .
they have become symbols of hope - as have their counterparts in eight other countries around the world .
women are represented in many parliaments .
more than 16 percent of parliamentary seats are held by women - more than ever before .
is the end of the patriarchal society nearing ?
is it just a matter of time before discrimination against the female sex has been overcome ? is discrimination-free female participation in the decision-making process now a reality ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor angela merkel is the first woman to hold the position in germany no .
what is 16 percent , when more than half the world 's population is female ?
the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .
women still have a harder time finding a job than men do .
and when they do have a job , it 's usually one without much status or influence .
women are still frequently paid far less than their male colleagues for equal work .
and even when the odd company places a woman in a leadership position , the men still prefer their boys ' club .
the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .
but at a time when the gap between rich and poor seems to be getting ever wider , a gender-specific view of society is particularly necessary .
how can societal powers , work , wealth and income be divided so that children can have opportunities and a future ? it 's to be expected that un general secretary kofi annan calls for more equality of the sexes on international women 's day .
but if he were to also point to successes various countries have had in actually achieving more equality through targeted programs , then it would become clear that lack of progress is mostly due to a lack of political will . it 's high time then for governments , organizations and companies to become active , in order to make women 's participation possible at all levels of decision-making processes , and in all areas of society . in this day and age , it 's potentially more important than ever .
given the current political and economic crises , the continuation of the patriarchal society represents an immeasurable strategy of risk . ulrike mast-kirschning -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wage gap between the sexes widens in germany elsewhere in europe , the gap between salaries earned by men and women for the same work has been narrowing , but the reverse is the case in germany .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .
the konrad site will be capable of storing up to 300,000 tons of low- and medium-grade radioactive waste produced by hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry , for example . no solution for reactor waste in sight the facility in salzgitter will not be used to store the highly radioactive waste from atomic energy plants - that will continue to go to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gorleben storage facility has met with fierce resistance following the nuclear phase-out agreement struck by the former coalition government , investigations into the suitability of gorleben 's salt domes for long-term nuclear waste storage were called off , and the site 's future remains uncertain . the german environmental protection ngo bund has called on federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to halt construction at the konrad site until the government has agreed on a permanent storage solution for all of germany 's nuclear waste . " since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .
she added that , contrary to statements from the state environment ministry , the konrad site lacks the long-term security to make it a suitable permanent storage facility . " the evidence for the site 's long-term security no longer reflects current scientific knowledge , " backhaus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal environment minister gabriel sigmar following the court 's decision on wednesday , environment minister gabriel said he shared in the criticism of the konrad site project and called for consensus on a general nuclear waste storage solution for germany . he added that while the konrad mine could be used to store 90 percent of the waste volume , it would " only account for 10 percent of the radioactivity in germany . " 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

turkish foreign minister abdullah gül meets eu representatives in vienna on wednesday .
the bureaucratic process for eu membership negotiations is on track , but the political climate is a different story . " on both sides , doubts are growing about a successful integration of turkey into the eu , " said heinz kramer , a turkey expert at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
" the reform drive that we 've gotten used to between 2002 and 2005 has been paralyzed . " udo steinbach , the director of the german institute for middle east studies , also believes that the process of modernization in turkey has stagnated .
elections in 2007 are partially to blame for this as prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has to deal with a majority of hardliners that support his islamic party for justice and development -lrb- akp -rrb- . domestic problems domestic conflicts are therefore responsible for turkey getting caught up in conflicts " that seemed a thing of the past , " steinbach said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan -lrb- right -rrb- and gül an invitation to militant palestinian group hamas must have pleased erdogan 's party supporters , who are mostly pro-palestinian and anti-israeli . " but such an invitation and such a stand leads to irritations with the eu , " kramer said , adding that by welcoming hamas , turkey 's government went against eu policy not to take up contact with hamas until it has renounced terror and recognized israel 's right to exist . turkey sees things differently and has had good relations with palestinians for several years - long before hamas ' election victory , steinbach said . erdogan wanted to emphasize turkey 's role as a regional power and its connection to the middle east by inviting hamas . " but it 's not clear yet whether turkey sees this role as a supplement or alternative to eu membership , " kramer said . turkey as mediator on wednesday , eu representatives - the austrian and finnish foreign ministers as well as eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and foreign affairs chief javier solana - are expected to talk to gül about a possible mediator role between the west and the islamic world in the aftermath of violent protests against danish caricatures of mohammad .
turks demonstrated as well , but they remained peaceful . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is not particularly well-liked in muslim countries right now " turkey 's behavior during the conflict shows that turkey no longer is a typical islamic country , " kramer said .
" but that 's exactly what makes it less credible as a mediator . " kramer added that turkey needs to recognize that it is a multiethnic nation - something that 's far from becoming reality . " turkish nationalism is rising again , " steinbach said , citing current turkish literature and the discussion surrounding turkish action movie " valley of wolves , " which has been described as anti-semitic , anti-christian and anti-kurdish in the west . " a lot remains to be done when it comes to turkish policies towards minorities , " kramer said . steinbach added that controversies like the one surrounding the move will not lead to eu membership negotiations being terminated . the cyprus issue the cyprus question is a different matter .

but this does not change anything about the economic isolation of the northern part of the island , kramer said . an escalation of the controversy could lead to cypriot greeks opposing further membership talks with turkey .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .

the representation of women in parliament has , seen globally , climbed only marginally in over 30 years , namely by around 5 percent .
the numbers are on the right path and document a certain level of persistence .
but the female share in most houses of representation remains well under the " critical mass " of 30 percent . but it 's only beyond this threshold that the kind of decision-making is possible that could lead in a different direction from the politics of the classic men 's circle , in which the narcissistic division of power counts for more than social responsibility and humanity , and in which the daily realities of many women could finally take center stage . business is no better equally little has changed when it comes to the economy .

the percentage of women in management board positions of publicly listed companies in germany is a paltry 4 percent . it 's not yet been proven whether women in leadership positions tend to focus less on capital interests and more on people when making business decisions .

riding a wave of populism and anti-establishment sentiment , the newly formed left party swept into the bundestag in september .
but cracks are beginning to show in party unity .
is their political future endangered ? on sept .
23 , a party cobbled into existence just six months before the elections swept into germany 's parliament as the country 's fourth strongest political party .
the left party 's success stunned pundits , many of whom wondered how long the curious mix of former east german communists and former west german unionists would last . the answer could come soon . this week , the electoral alternative for labor and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which makes up 11,800 of the left party 's 71,000-member roster , is voting on whether to begin the process of officially becoming one with the bigger party . under an agreement signed in december , the two groups , which won 8.7 percent of the national vote in september , would fuse into one party by 2007 and not run candidates against each other in state elections . but some party officials are already reneging on the party line . " no money-back guarantee " saying they are frustrated with the compromises left party officials have had to make in governing coalitions with social democrats in berlin and the state of mecklenburg western pomerania , the wasg is planning on pitting candidates against the left party in upcoming elections .
the moves have unsettled party leadership and called the future of the nascent left party into question .
bildunterschrift : together , the left party and the wasg won 8.7 percent of the vote " people who voted for the left party woke up a half a year later to realize that the left party for which they voted is in actuality two parties , " wrote jörg schneider , a columnist for the frankfurter rundschau .
" it 's like during a sales event - you buy one , you get the other free , but without a money-back guarantee . " unionists who felt former chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- was drifting too far to the center sought refuge in the wasg .
for the successors of east germany 's communist party , the wasg served as a way to expand beyond their traditional strongholds in the former east .
but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .
" the left party will probably become a stable element of the german party system , because they enjoy advantages of dimension , " said holtmann . " but ... the history of the german system reveals that former efforts to found and consolidate competing parties left of the spd have failed ...

but the marriage was one of convenience not desire , and the wasg has been plagued by infighting from the beginning . nothing amiss , says party leadership in addition to the traditional unionists , the electoral alternative includes " some strains that have an extreme left background , " said everhard holtmann , a political scientist at the university of halle , especially , he adds , in eastern germany . " it 's difficult to bring those two parts together , " he said . top officials have gone out of their way recently to assuage members that the party is not in danger of splitting up .
the possibility that wasg candidates could compete against left party candidates in berlin in september will have no effect on the 54-member bundestag group , said party leader oskar lafontaine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : nothing to worry about " that 's a fairy tale that the political right has introduced into the discussion , " he said in a newspaper interview .
european climate right for new left experts , including holtmann , say it 's likely the wasg will vote for the fusion to take place some time in 2007 . the left party 's continued existence would fit into an overall trend across europe , where frustration with established parties in times of economic turmoil have given rise to new , niche parties on the left .
in spain and portugal , leftist parties have proven particularly successful , as have parties in the former eastern bloc states . " until now , the exception has been great britain and germany , " said holtmann .
" but maybe that will change in germany in the future . " experts say the left party still has discontent on its side .
unemployment has reached 5 million , or around 11.5 percent of the population , and though the consumer climate and growth forecasts are on the upswing , the general frustration with the direction of the country remains a powerful undercurrent in the populace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jobs continue to be hard to come by as long as the grand coalition government of social democrats and conservatives led by chancellor angela merkel performs poorly on the job creation front , the success of the left party is assured . " their success is partially a result of the mood is parts of the country , " said holtmann . history cautions if history is any indication , party leaders gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine will have to work hard to keep their members pacified .
new parties to the left of the social democrats have been created before , and all have folded under pressure from the mightier spd .
" the left party will probably become a stable element of the german party system , because they enjoy advantages of dimension , " said holtmann . " but ... the history of the german system reveals that former efforts to found and consolidate competing parties left of the spd have failed ...
it 's not quite clear yet , what will happen .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : sounds like germany krautrock created a new sound for a new generation german rap keeps it real mozart classic gets street treatment in berlin update happy birthday , herbert grönemeyer ! culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.03.2006 german rock under fire for god song großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oomph ! takes aim at the church in " god is a popstar " europe 's mohammed cartoon controversy has claimed a german rock band as its latest victim .
germany 's top music awards show cancelled a performance of the church-critical song " god is a popstar , " by the band oomph ! . the song by the trio of gothic-rock musicians begins harmlessly enough .
but when the chanting of the " lord 's prayer " fades out , the tone sharpens and the band oomph ! takes aim at christianity . " i give you love , i give you hope , " they sing .
" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .
the video , which depicts the transformation of a homeless man bearing a likeness to jesus into a media star and back again , has also raised the hackles of music television execs . this week , the band received the push that ensured a media spectacle .
german broadcaster rtl cancelled a planned oomph ! performance on march 12 at the echo awards , germany 's top music awards show . " even christians need protection " an rtl statement said that " in the context of the current , international religious discussion " a performance of the song would n't be appropriate . european media have been on edge since published cartoons of the prophet mohammed sparked a worldwide controversy and lead to deaths during riots in the middle east .
now it seems the controversy has spread to other artistic mediums , and religions .

kai müller at the tagesspiegel compared rtl 's decision to the decision of the bishopric of brno in the czech republic .
following a papal order , the bishopric banned performances of gustav mahler 's music in a church because it was n't eulogistic enough . demanding tolerance , but providing none " the scenario has nothing to do with the denigration of christianity , " müller wrote of the oomph ! lyrics .
" it 's more about not getting caught up in visions of redemption . " the band itself said it was surprised by the reaction .
as they wrote the song , they mulled the many forms of deification in society today , they said in a statement on their web site .
they claimed they wanted to criticize the church as well as take aim at the pop stars celebrated by the media and fans as " new gods . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fake popstars as " new gods " singer dero said that the decision to ban the performance was a curious one by a society so ready to demand tolerance from other religions . " on the one hand , we in the west demand from those of other faiths that they be more accepting of critical perspectives of their religion , " he wrote .
" on the other hand , we counter an attitude in our country that completely contradicts this . " mohammed controversy , it is n't despite the back and forth , the issue is n't likely to prompt the intellectual and high-octane debate sparked by the mohammed cartoons , at least according to some commentators . " this , " wrote the left-wing taz newspaper , " is about a below average band , with a less than original song , the banning of which a substandard broadcaster hopes will spark a little interest in a bleak event .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .
the konrad site will be capable of storing up to 300,000 tons of low- and medium-grade radioactive waste produced by hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry , for example . no solution for reactor waste in sight the facility in salzgitter will not be used to store the highly radioactive waste from atomic energy plants - that will continue to go to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gorleben storage facility has met with fierce resistance following the nuclear phase-out agreement struck by the former coalition government , investigations into the suitability of gorleben 's salt domes for long-term nuclear waste storage were called off , and the site 's future remains uncertain . the german environmental protection ngo bund has called on federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to halt construction at the konrad site until the government has agreed on a permanent storage solution for all of germany 's nuclear waste . " since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .
she added that , contrary to statements from the state environment ministry , the konrad site lacks the long-term security to make it a suitable permanent storage facility . " the evidence for the site 's long-term security no longer reflects current scientific knowledge , " backhaus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal environment minister gabriel sigmar following the court 's decision on wednesday , environment minister gabriel said he shared in the criticism of the konrad site project and called for consensus on a general nuclear waste storage solution for germany . he added that while the konrad mine could be used to store 90 percent of the waste volume , it would " only account for 10 percent of the radioactivity in germany . " 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

" if iran does n't respond to words , we believe the world community should entertain the possibility of sanctions , " under-secretary of state nicholas burns told a house of representatives committee . " but it 's going to be incumbent upon our allies around the world to show that they are willing to act , " he added . elbaradei hopeful of political settlement in vienna , the international atomic energy agency wrapped up a three-day regular meeting that focused wednesday on the iranian standoff , with an assessment by iaea director mohamed elbaradei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iaea 's director general mohamed elbaradei thinks its still too early for sanctions he said it was still possible to reach a political settlement and urged all sides to " lower the rhetoric " to achieve this .
" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

" this is simply a new phase of diplomacy , an extension of diplomatic efforts to find a solution , " elbaradei said . unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers and can impose punitive measures , including sanctions .
europe and the united states have led the drive for action , saying iran has hidden the truth about its nuclear program and should not be allowed to enrich uranium , which can provide the fuel for civilian reactors but also , in highly enriched form , the material for atomic weapons .
" iran has not met the conditions at the iaea " to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with inspectors , burns said . iran threatens us with " harm and pain " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergei lavrov with us secretary of state condoleezza rice in washington russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , for his part , said in new york that there was no military solution to the row and cast doubt on the effectiveness of any sanctions against tehran .
moscow has been trying to broker a compromise under which iran could enrich uranium in russia , so that it gets the nuclear fuel but not the technology for making bombs .
iran has proposed suspending industrial-scale enrichment but doing research work , but the west says even small-scale enrichment is too dangerous . iranian security official javad vaidi , who led the iranian delegation here , threatened reprisals against the united states .
" the united states may have the power to cause harm and pain but it is also susceptible to harm and pain , " he said .
" so if the united states wishes to choose that path , let the ball roll . "
vaidi reiterated that iran would press on with small-scale enrichment work despite the iaea 's calls to halt this activity . " we will continue to exercise our r and d activities based on our right , " vaidi said , referring to research and development . he said iran would not - for now - use its key role as an oil supplier as a weapon in the international dispute over its nuclear program but may review the situation later .
iran is to continue its current level of cooperation with the iaea , iranian ambassador ali-agsar soltanieh said . " lower the rhetoric " mark malloch brown , the incoming un deputy secretary general , said iran had been referred to the security council because its five permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - had to assume it was hiding something . speaking on bbc radio , he said it was still unclear what iran 's intentions were but " at this point , the permanent five have concluded that , because iran has not been seen as coming clean on what it was doing , we have to assume the likelihood of a military program , and therefore must have security council action . " he said any movement toward sanctions would be gradual but that if tehran did not change tack , action could follow within months .
in vienna , schulte said elbaradei 's report " makes clear " that tehran failed to meet iaea demands in a february 4 resolution to suspend all enrichment and cooperate fully with agency inspectors .
the iaea reported iran to the security council on that day but asked it to hold off on any action until elbaradei had made an assessment report .
" everybody is looking forward to a political settlement , " elbaradei said . " what we need at this stage is for people to lower the rhetoric , to see how we can go forward . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier along with eu representatives are urging that diplomacy is n't dead german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier on wednesday said the international community remained " obliged " to find a " diplomatic solution " to the iranian nuclear crisis .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

" good relations between poland and germany are important for all of europe , " kaczynski told reporters after their meeting , adding that he was " deeply convinced " that berlin and warsaw needed close ties . merkel told reporters the two leaders would discuss international relations and the future of the european union during a working lunch . disagreements over eu constitution both leaders openly disagree on the eu constitution , which the german chancellor wants to help revive after it was rejected by french and dutch voters and put on ice by the bloc . kaczynski , in an interview with wednesday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , reiterated his view that the treaty needed to be re-drafted . " we need a new constitution for europe , " he told the newspaper , adding that the current draft " is no longer relevant .

" but only to deceive , because you all want to be lied to . " since its release , " god is a popstar " has given several german radio stations pause .

the lawsuits were brought by local councils responsible for the site of the proposed dump , as well as two farmers who fear the waste could contaminate their land . the court upheld a ruling from the regional authorities in 2002 , in which the konrad site , as the former mine is known , was licensed to the state 's environment ministry .
no further appeals will be permitted . " the mine is impervious and therefore fulfills the most important criteria , " said joachim blüth of lower saxony 's environment ministry . the underground storage facility could be completed within five years .
the waste will be kept in galleries sunk as deep as 1,300 meters -lrb- 4,260 -rrb- feet below the surface .
the konrad site will be capable of storing up to 300,000 tons of low- and medium-grade radioactive waste produced by hospitals or the pharmaceutical industry , for example . no solution for reactor waste in sight the facility in salzgitter will not be used to store the highly radioactive waste from atomic energy plants - that will continue to go to a " temporary " storage facility in the eastern german town of gorleben . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gorleben storage facility has met with fierce resistance following the nuclear phase-out agreement struck by the former coalition government , investigations into the suitability of gorleben 's salt domes for long-term nuclear waste storage were called off , and the site 's future remains uncertain . the german environmental protection ngo bund has called on federal environment minister sigmar gabriel to halt construction at the konrad site until the government has agreed on a permanent storage solution for all of germany 's nuclear waste . " since highly radioactive waste ca n't be stored at the konrad site , a second permanent storage facility still has to be found , " said renate backhaus , atomic expert at bund .
she added that , contrary to statements from the state environment ministry , the konrad site lacks the long-term security to make it a suitable permanent storage facility . " the evidence for the site 's long-term security no longer reflects current scientific knowledge , " backhaus said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal environment minister gabriel sigmar following the court 's decision on wednesday , environment minister gabriel said he shared in the criticism of the konrad site project and called for consensus on a general nuclear waste storage solution for germany . he added that while the konrad mine could be used to store 90 percent of the waste volume , it would " only account for 10 percent of the radioactivity in germany . " 20 years in the making the project to build a permanent storage facility for germany 's low-grade radioactive waste was launched during the chancellery of helmut kohl when the current chancellor angela merkel was environment minister . one billion euros -lrb- $ 1.19 billion -rrb- have already been invested in the project and the final cost could rise to 1.5 billion euros . as yet , there is no consensus from scientists on the question of whether or not it is safe to store nuclear waste in geological formations deep beneath the earth 's surface . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : protestors halt nuclear convoy en route to storage site anti-nuclear protestors repeatedly halted a controversial shipment of highly radioactive nuclear waste from france monday bound for a temporary storage facility in northern germany .

" the energy challenges of the 21st century require a common eu response , " said barroso at the press conference introducing the report on wednesday .
the eu had called for the report after a gas dispute between russia and ukraine caused energy shortages in europe in january .
eastern european countries , but also major eu players like germany , are heavily reliant on russian natural gas , with algeria and norway also important providers . nationalism an energy problem at the moment , 50 percent of the eu 's energy use is dependent on energy imports .
by 2030 , according to the report , that figure could rise to 70 percent and require more than 1 trillion euros of investment in infrastructure .
though europe is a champion of alternative energies and low-emissions cars , the report accuses the continent of not working hard enough to integrate its utility markets and increase competition among energy providers fighting for europe 's 450 million consumers . " we should refuse nationalism of an economic kind , especially in the energy sector in europe , " said barroso . the comments came on the heels of german utilities company e.on 's failed takeover of spain 's endesa and the government-engineered merger of gaz de france and suez , which scared off italy 's enel .
the eu commission has asked spain and france for explanations on the failed takeover bids , but the greens in the european parliament criticized the report for not taking a harder line on the energy " oligopoly " in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : e.on 's planned 29 million euro takeover has been held up " the current surge in mergers risks concentrating eu energy provision in the hands of a small oligopoly of energy behemoths to the detriment of the eu economy and consumers across europe , " said claude turmes , vice-president of the greens / european free alliance in the eu parliament in a statement .
" protectionism is not the answer . " a plea for more efficient energy use his party also criticized the eu for placing too much emphasis on securing current energy supplies , rather than searching for more efficient uses of energy .
they point out that in 2005 , 96 percent of energy use in the transportation sector stemmed from oil . " we can not reduce our oil dependency without tackling our oil-guzzling transport sector , " turmes said . the report foresees increased reliance in alternative energies and calls for more innovation , especially in the development of low-carbon fuels .
ngos like greenpeace urged the eu to hold the 25 member states to pledges that demand 20 percent of energy use from alternative fuels by 2020 .
alternatives such as wind and solar power are gaining ground in countries like germany , but barroso said that every possibility - including nuclear energy - should be considered in the attempt to diversify europe 's supply .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all energy forms must be considered , said barroso meeting with russia on gas reliance " we do not have the luxury of promoting one energy source to the exclusion of others , " he wrote in a statement with european commissioner of energy andris piebalgs printed in the international herald tribune . barroso has called for a " debate without taboos " and eu chiefs will get the opportunity to do just that at an upcoming summit on march 23 and 24th . a week before eu leaders meet , barroso will travel to moscow to discuss europe 's energy reliance with russian president vladimir putin .
" our approach is to engage constructively with our russian partners , and that is the message i 'm going to give , " he said . around 25 percent of the european union 's gas supply comes from russia . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : merger plans reignite eu energy market competition row while the european union is calling for more cross-border competition in the energy market , france and spain have recently taken protectionist steps to protect their energy companies from takeovers by foreign firms .

three co-op stores in the oxford area are offering the service , which is said to be the first of its kind in europe .
it means shoppers do not need to carry cash or cards to the supermarket and need not remember chip-and-pin numbers .
" pay and touch " allows customers to have a finger scan linked to their bank details so payment for goods can be taken directly from accounts .
the payment system is already in use in the us where nearly 2.5m shoppers have signed up .
it is free to use for customers , who can register at home on the internet or at the participating stores .
worn-down fingerprints a midcounties co-operative supermarket spokesman told the bbc : " it offers us a slight edge over the competition .
" it 's a very tough retail world and anything we can do to encourage more people to shop with us gives us a commercial benefit . "
fingerprint recognition is seen as generally very reliable but it is unclear if many retailers will be willing to pay for the technology so soon after the introduction of chip-and-pin .
builders could have problems because the manual work wears down their fingerprints and surgeons face similar problems because of all the hand-washing they do .

her outburst appears to have been prompted by recent changes to malaysia 's islamic family law that makes it easier for muslim men to take multiple wives , to divorce them and to take a share of their property .
the women 's ministry encouraged female lawmakers to vote for the measures , saying they could be amended later .
that prompted widespread criticism and has led miss marina to suggest the ministry be split in two - one to help non-muslim women fight discrimination , the other to keep muslim women , in her words , bound and gagged .
however , compared to many other countries both in south east asia and the wider muslim world , malaysian women - muslims included - play a prominent role both in business and public life .

the world-famous singer , until recently seen in celebrity magazines holding a drink and a cigarette is backing no smoking day this year .
church chucked her 20-a-day habit at new year , and apart from a lapse on her birthday , has stuck to her resolution .
but she has warned other quitters they will need " willpower " .
promoting the no-smoking message in cardiff , the 20-year-old admitted she found it " really hard " , but was motivated by changes in the tone of her voice to quit .
" i could hear a change in my voice and thought , what am i doing here ?
it 's my profession , " she said .
" i just did it through sheer willpower .
i did n't have any patches .
" i was really irritable for the first three weeks .
i did have a relapse on my birthday , had a few glasses of wine , smoked two cigarettes .
i was really ill the next day - i wo n't be doing that again . "
church has her levels of carbon monoxide tested her wales rugby international boyfriend , gavin henson , had not " nagged her " to give up , but she did concede : " he 's really glad i 've given up now because i do n't smell of cigarettes .
" when my family comes to my house , they all smoke and i can really smell it .
" my nana has tried a couple of times and she 's cut down loads so she 's doing really well . "
the fashion-conscious singer has seen an improvement in her skin since stopping - she said in the past her skin had felt like a tv advert " where the girl puts make-up on and it 's all smoke " .
church claims not to miss smoking most of the time .
however , she admitted : " the one time i think about it is when i go out and have a drink .
" i hold a cigarette in my hand but i do n't light it .
it 's just something to do with my hands . "
i can never have another cigarette in my life charlotte church she has found her appetite has increased since quitting .
" after a meal i 'd have a cigarette but i 'd have more food now , snacks etc , but nothing i ca n't control , " she said .
the singer , who started smoking at 16 , urged teenagers not to follow her example in taking up the habit .
" the longer you smoke , the harder it is to give up .
it 's so not worth starting , " she asserted .
and because of ever-present paparazzi photographers , church knows she can not get away with sneaking a " cheeky cigarette " in public .
she also fears falling back into the habit if she has just one .
" if i had another cigarette now , it would be so easy to get back into it .
" i can never have another cigarette in my life . "
the welsh assembly government has estimated about 50,000 people in wales will try to give up smoking on wednesday , with around 8,000 succeeding .

the daily telegraph says he was also forced to carry the can for its financial crisis while the daily mail describes him as the " fall guy " .
the times says tony blair thought the nhs had " taken its foot off the pedal " .
but there is anger in some quarters at his " gold-plated " early retirement package and pension , " topped with a peerage " , as the daily express puts it .
' re-establishing reputation ' the departure of sunday telegraph editor sarah sands , according to the independent , follows a " disastrous " relaunch of the paper .
the relaunch was aimed at making the paper more appealing to women but cost the title some 30,000 readers , the independent adds .
the guardian says her replacement , patience wheatcroft , is expected to put news and politics at the paper 's heart .
she will re-establish a reputation for breaking news and analysis , it adds .
critics fears the daily mirror says that terror suspects at belmarsh prison in london will get laptop computers to help them prepare their legal cases .
the paper says critics believe prisoners could use them to orchestrate criminal activity , even though there will be no internet access .
the mirror also reports criticism of belmarsh by anne owers .
staff did not understand the religious behaviour of muslims , the chief inspector of prisons said in a report .
cross to bear finally , is a cross displayed in the grounds of a church an advertisement ?
dudley borough council says it is .
the express reports that a methodist church has been told it has to pay £ 75 for a planning application to put up a cross .
it is deemed to be an advert under the 1990 town and country planning act , the paper reports .
the church 's minister tells the mail : " the only thing we want to sell is the word of the gospel . "

in a series of articles from interested parties supporting and opposed to the ban , lung specialist kenneth anderson gives the view from a health professional 's standpoint .
dr anderson is a consultant in respiratory medicine in kilmarnock and co-chair of the glasgow school of respiratory science .
we , the scots , have characteristics which some argue have done well for the world - innovative , tenacious , warm hearted and gregarious .
scotland has high rates of smoking-related disease the extremes are sometimes what we do best .
no stopping us - most lung cancer , most emphysema , most heart disease , most stroke , shortest half-life , the ground zero of world cancer .
" here 's tae us .
wha 's like us - gye few and there all deid " .
my patients tell me every day that they have stopped smoking now , wished they had stopped years ago or that they wish the clock would go back .
" the braes are getting steeper doctor . "
do any of them express even a little dismay about the proposed smoking control plans ?
" it would be fantastic to think about a meal out and know that smoke wo n't make my asthma worse . "
" do you think they would let me into my local again - me wearing oxygen ? "
could it be that the tobacco-health conundrum of the scot is going too ?
not even a glimmer of regret for a passing phase .
what we are now seeing from governments around the world is that health -lrb- and cigarette smoking -rrb- is not a soft option .
my patients tell me that scotland should be in there with this bunch of do-gooders .
poor health is exactly what it is .
why should some in scotland be picked off by these dismal economics and have the highest rates of all the smoking diseases ?

japan 's economy , the second largest in the world , has been dogged by deflation for the best part of a decade .
however , recent figures have shown that the economy is improving and steady price growth may have returned .
the bank of japan is worried that cheap credit at a time of improving growth may create a property and asset bubble .
no return japan 's government has urged caution , warning that it was still too early to say that the spectre of deflation had been banished for good .
prime minister junichiro koizumi said earlier this week that the central bank " must not allow deflation to return " .
interest rates were slashed to zero almost five years ago , and the central bank has been pumping extra cash into the economy in an effort to halt deflation .
while there is a chance of an interest rate rise in april , most investors will be watching the bank of japan 's statement after the meeting ends for any clues as to future policy .
" the market has already priced in an imminent move , " said takahide kiuchi , a senior economist at nomura securities .

japan 's economy , the second largest in the world , has been dogged by deflation for the best part of a decade .
however , recent figures have shown that the economy is improving and steady price growth may have returned .
the bank of japan is worried that cheap credit at a time of improving growth may create a property and asset bubble .
no return japan 's government has urged caution , warning that it was still too early to say that the spectre of deflation had been banished for good .
prime minister junichiro koizumi said earlier this week that the central bank " must not allow deflation to return " .
interest rates were slashed to zero almost five years ago , and the central bank has been pumping extra cash into the economy in an effort to halt deflation .
while there is a chance of an interest rate rise in april , most investors will be watching the bank of japan 's statement after the meeting ends for any clues as to future policy .
" the market has already priced in an imminent move , " said takahide kiuchi , a senior economist at nomura securities .

three hundred jobs are due to go and some theatres and wards will close as a result of a deficit of more than £ 8.1m.
falmouth and camborne lib dem mp julia goldsworthy said she thought health ministers might be unaware of the gravity of the situation .
the hospital trust will be speaking at a press briefing on wednesday .
ms goldsworthy said : " clearly i do n't think they understand that this is the only acute hospital in cornwall and perhaps they are not aware of the huge impact this is going to have on frontline services .
