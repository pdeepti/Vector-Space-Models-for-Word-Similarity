program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.11.2006 no causal relationship between video games and violence exists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting game " counter-strike " has been blamed for provoking violence politicians have raised the issue of whether violent video games contributed to a school shooting in germany this week .
dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .
if they are too graphic in their descriptions then they run into the risk that many young people have access to the paradigm and the pattern and think , " hey , i will follow this . "
in many cases , they , unfortunately , have many features that we have already seen in other cases . professor klaus hurrelmann is a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , germany . rachel ryan interviewed klaus hurrelmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german school attacker shot himself in head a german teenager shot himself in the head after going on a shooting rampage at his former school in emsdetten .
-lrb- 21.11.2006 -rrb- violent video games under coalition fire it 's a given that plenty of people will find source for complaint in the new government 's plans for the coming four years .
computer games enthusiasts could be among those doing the moaning .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

" if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .

it was previously uncertain whether the teenager had shot himself or whether the pipe bombs attached to his body had exploded . at least 32 people were injured in monday 's shooting .
one of the school 's maintenance men suffered a gunshot wound in his stomach , and three girls and a boy , aged from 12 to 16 , were also shot . police said none of those injured was in critical condition , although two students were " seriously injured . " the youth , wearing a black balaclava and black gloves , entered his former school on monday at about 9:30 a.m.
cet and began shooting at students . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 700 students were evacuated from the school the 18-year old then set off smoke bombs and retreated to the second floor of the building .
police later found him dead on the floor with two sawn-off shot guns lying next to him . police shocked to find explosives police found a knife and three pipe bombs wired together on the young man 's body . five more pipe bombs were discovered in his backpack and four in his car .
similar devices were found in the garage of the young man 's home .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser . " the message also contained the words , " i hate people , " and ended with the words , " i 'm outta here . " teachers in emsdetten said the attacker had been a loner who often dressed completely in black and wore a long , black trench coat . according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . " calls for violent games to be banned in reaction to the shooting , politicians and teachers warned against increasing violence in films and computer games . the german teachers association president , josef kraus , said in the german daily bild that violent computer games led young people to believe that " the strongest achieve the quickest victories . " " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .
in a study of the oecd countries , germany is in the second-to-last place when it comes to the proportion of students to school psychologists , bosbach told bayerischer rundfunk television .

it was previously uncertain whether the teenager had shot himself or whether the pipe bombs attached to his body had exploded . at least 32 people were injured in monday 's shooting .
one of the school 's maintenance men suffered a gunshot wound in his stomach , and three girls and a boy , aged from 12 to 16 , were also shot . police said none of those injured was in critical condition , although two students were " seriously injured . " the youth , wearing a black balaclava and black gloves , entered his former school on monday at about 9:30 a.m.
cet and began shooting at students . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 700 students were evacuated from the school the 18-year old then set off smoke bombs and retreated to the second floor of the building .
police later found him dead on the floor with two sawn-off shot guns lying next to him . police shocked to find explosives police found a knife and three pipe bombs wired together on the young man 's body . five more pipe bombs were discovered in his backpack and four in his car .
similar devices were found in the garage of the young man 's home .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser . " the message also contained the words , " i hate people , " and ended with the words , " i 'm outta here . " teachers in emsdetten said the attacker had been a loner who often dressed completely in black and wore a long , black trench coat . according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . " calls for violent games to be banned in reaction to the shooting , politicians and teachers warned against increasing violence in films and computer games . the german teachers association president , josef kraus , said in the german daily bild that violent computer games led young people to believe that " the strongest achieve the quickest victories . " " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike .

" if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .

however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .

i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .
if they are too graphic in their descriptions then they run into the risk that many young people have access to the paradigm and the pattern and think , " hey , i will follow this . "

11 , to decide on turkey 's prospects for joining the 25-nation bloc . if turkey continues to refuse to meet the eu 's demands to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic , the country 's prospects for membership would face an " uncertain future , " said finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency . " time is running out .
if there is no agreement and turkey does not honor its commitments , the eu will need to consider the implications for the accession process , " vanhanen added .
" this is not a good scenario . " looking for compromise the finnish leader said he expected the european commission to table a recommendation on turkey 's progress on the cyprus issue in the first week of december .
an eu decision on whether to suspend or continue membership negotiations would then be pushed to dec.11 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is trying to get turkish cypriots to open up ports finland is struggling to hammer out a compromise deal under which the turkish cypriot port of famagusta would be opened for trade with the eu in return for a move by ankara to allow greek cypriot ships into its harbors .
the internationally recognized republic of cyprus is controlled by the greek cypriot government in the south , with the northern third of the divided island recognized only by turkey . in spite of a customs deal that turkey has signed with all 25 member countries , ankara does not have diplomatic relations with cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 .
ankara has long argued that it will only comply with eu demands once the bloc ends its current economic boycott of the turkish portion of cyprus . trying to avert a crisis the finnish premier said he was trying hard to avert a crisis in the accession talks before germany assumes the six-month eu presidency . " the presidency still believes that a solution is possible , " said vanhanen , adding that it was still up to the united nations to try to reach a comprehensive settlement on the cyprus issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ther eu is not an " impartial broker , " acoording to turkish cypriot leader talat turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , who met with united nations chief kofi annan in geneva on monday , said the outgoing secretary general 's proposals remained the best hope for resolving the turkish-cypriot impasse and securing unification of the island . annan 's plan , which was approved by turkish cypriots in a 2004 referendum but rejected by the greek side , " continues to be the basis of any solution in the future , " talat told reporters . un help needed talat added that he did not see the european union as capable of reaching a solution , saying it could not act as an " impartial and honest broker " since both greece and the greek cypriot government were eu members . " unfortunately , the finnish plan is giving everything to the greek cypriots , " he said . talat conceded that he had received no guarantee from annan that the new secretary general , ban ki-moon , who takes over in january , would stick to the plan . even if the turkey-cyprus crisis is resolved , accession talks for the huge , secular country , which is predominantly muslim , are expected to take at least a decade . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers options in turkish accession talks eu foreign ministers were downbeat monday on the chance of a swift agreement from turkey to lift its trade embargo on cyprus to facilitate membership talks , as nicosia maintained a hard line .

similar devices were found in the garage of the young man 's home .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser .

" " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .

union officials said the job cuts would leave roughly 1,500 workers at the factory , but voiced fears that the lay-offs could be a prelude to full closure of the site . trade unions : the worst catastrophe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be history in brussels ?
" this is the worst catastrophe that we 've been through so far , " said pascal van cauwenberge , an official with the csc christian union at the factory .
" in my opinion , with 1,500 workers , volkswagen brussels is no longer viable .
it 's the first step before closure . " as tensions with management rise , unions called on workers to protest outside the plant tuesday afternoon . " we have the impression that we 've been abandoned by everybody , " said 43-year-old worker joseph de geyter while awaiting news with about 50 other colleagues at the entrance of the plant .
" if 4,000 people are fired , that 's because we do n't count any more . " close to 193,000 golf cars were scheduled to be built in brussels this year and 11,000 polo cars . major restructuring bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw officials said that production is cheaper at headquarters in wolfsburg volkswagen is in the process of implementing a vast restructuring plan , sparked by losses at its flagship vw brand and difficulties in the all-important chinese market .
the german group is to slash 20,000 jobs across germany and was known to be preparing to wield the axe in belgium , portugal and spain . vw officials said in a statement that they would manufacture the golf at only two european sites in future , both in germany at the group 's home plant in wolfsburg and at its mosel factory in saxony .
they added that production in germany would be " considerably cheaper . " " the car market in western europe is saturated and is struggling with overcapacity , " the statement said .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

the constitutional court is hearing the case of a man who carried out a secret dna test because he did not believe he was the father of his ex-partner 's then 12-year-old daughter . the man , who name has not been released by the court , claimed he should not be legally responsible for the child after a test carried out on saliva taken from the girl 's chewing gum proved he is not biologically related to the girl . his claim was rejected by the federal court in january 2005 on the grounds that the testing of genetic material without permission contravenes people 's constitutional right to determine what happens with their personal information . now the father is arguing that he also has a constitutional right - in this case to know his exact relationship to the girl . genetic testing easily available the german states have differing opinions on how to balance a father 's desire to verify paternity against the right to genetic confidentiality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said many other eu countries have banned secret dna testing the southern german state of baden-württemberg wants to allow secret paternity testing whereas neighboring bavaria wants to prohibit the process .
however , a draft bavaria law proposes giving the father the possibility of compelling the child to take a genetic test . dna testing conducted by a private clinic in germany costs between 300 and 800 euros -lrb- $ 385 and $ 1,026 -rrb- , and it can be even cheaper on the internet . only a small piece of genetic material - such as a hair sample or saliva found a toothbrush - is necessary for the test , which is more than 99.9 percent accurate . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : courts right to bar secret testing a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .
if they are too graphic in their descriptions then they run into the risk that many young people have access to the paradigm and the pattern and think , " hey , i will follow this . "
in many cases , they , unfortunately , have many features that we have already seen in other cases . professor klaus hurrelmann is a specialist in sociology and child development at the university of bielefeld , germany . rachel ryan interviewed klaus hurrelmann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german school attacker shot himself in head a german teenager shot himself in the head after going on a shooting rampage at his former school in emsdetten .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.11.2006 international nuclear fusion project agreed upon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could atomic power stations like these soon be history ?
an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .
" we are very confident that this thing will work .
we are putting fusion to the test .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .

so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.
saturday , hours that we are usually closed , " said store spokesman steffen ritter .
" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .

laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .
church officials such as bishop wolfgang huber , chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany told news agency dpa that the move was " a mistake " and a " cloak and dagger " operation . union leaders are grumbling , too .
currently , many large retailers , such as karstadtquelle and metro , are in negotiations with workers ' representatives to be able to stay open longer - union leaders say they want to find a way to get extra compensation for employees forced to work the later hours . as a result , most berlin retailers kept to their original store hours this weekend .
according to representatives from the karstadt , kadewe , wertheim and galleries lafayette department stores , it was n't possible to rearrange employee schedules so quickly , though they added that they hope to extend their hours by dec .

clothier c & a at alexanderplatz stayed open friday and saturday until 10 p.m.
shops near dussmann , such rossmann pharmacy and butlers , which sells housewares , also stayed open late saturday when they saw the there was so much action down the street . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this be a spot for a second date ?
" it was a last minute decision , " said a butlers ' employee , adding that it was only decided saturday afternoon . some shoppers said they hoped that grocery stores would follow suit , while others said it would be great to be able to hit the shops on sundays all year round as well . for at least two shoppers , the new opening hours provided more than a chance to get some early christmas shopping done . a dussmann customer who declined to give his name whispered that he brought his blind date to the bookstore because it was a great way to get to know her : " it 's more comfortable than a bar .

she also said a new law currently being drafted by the german health ministry regulating genetic diagnostics would make it a punishable offence to carry out dna tests without a person 's knowledge . " it does n't matter if this affects the supposed father , or the employee or the insurance agency , " zypries said after the two-hour hearing at the constitutional court in karlsruhe . however , the minister added that the barriers for carrying out a paternity test should be lowered .

however , a draft bavaria law proposes giving the father the possibility of compelling the child to take a genetic test . dna testing conducted by a private clinic in germany costs between 300 and 800 euros -lrb- $ 385 and $ 1,026 -rrb- , and it can be even cheaper on the internet . only a small piece of genetic material - such as a hair sample or saliva found a toothbrush - is necessary for the test , which is more than 99.9 percent accurate . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : courts right to bar secret testing a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .

the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .

at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .

11 , to decide on turkey 's prospects for joining the 25-nation bloc . if turkey continues to refuse to meet the eu 's demands to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic , the country 's prospects for membership would face an " uncertain future , " said finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency . " time is running out .
if there is no agreement and turkey does not honor its commitments , the eu will need to consider the implications for the accession process , " vanhanen added .
" this is not a good scenario . " looking for compromise the finnish leader said he expected the european commission to table a recommendation on turkey 's progress on the cyprus issue in the first week of december .
an eu decision on whether to suspend or continue membership negotiations would then be pushed to dec.11 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is trying to get turkish cypriots to open up ports finland is struggling to hammer out a compromise deal under which the turkish cypriot port of famagusta would be opened for trade with the eu in return for a move by ankara to allow greek cypriot ships into its harbors .
the internationally recognized republic of cyprus is controlled by the greek cypriot government in the south , with the northern third of the divided island recognized only by turkey . in spite of a customs deal that turkey has signed with all 25 member countries , ankara does not have diplomatic relations with cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 .
ankara has long argued that it will only comply with eu demands once the bloc ends its current economic boycott of the turkish portion of cyprus . trying to avert a crisis the finnish premier said he was trying hard to avert a crisis in the accession talks before germany assumes the six-month eu presidency . " the presidency still believes that a solution is possible , " said vanhanen , adding that it was still up to the united nations to try to reach a comprehensive settlement on the cyprus issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ther eu is not an " impartial broker , " acoording to turkish cypriot leader talat turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , who met with united nations chief kofi annan in geneva on monday , said the outgoing secretary general 's proposals remained the best hope for resolving the turkish-cypriot impasse and securing unification of the island . annan 's plan , which was approved by turkish cypriots in a 2004 referendum but rejected by the greek side , " continues to be the basis of any solution in the future , " talat told reporters . un help needed talat added that he did not see the european union as capable of reaching a solution , saying it could not act as an " impartial and honest broker " since both greece and the greek cypriot government were eu members . " unfortunately , the finnish plan is giving everything to the greek cypriots , " he said . talat conceded that he had received no guarantee from annan that the new secretary general , ban ki-moon , who takes over in january , would stick to the plan . even if the turkey-cyprus crisis is resolved , accession talks for the huge , secular country , which is predominantly muslim , are expected to take at least a decade . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers options in turkish accession talks eu foreign ministers were downbeat monday on the chance of a swift agreement from turkey to lift its trade embargo on cyprus to facilitate membership talks , as nicosia maintained a hard line .

11 , to decide on turkey 's prospects for joining the 25-nation bloc . if turkey continues to refuse to meet the eu 's demands to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic , the country 's prospects for membership would face an " uncertain future , " said finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency . " time is running out .
if there is no agreement and turkey does not honor its commitments , the eu will need to consider the implications for the accession process , " vanhanen added .
" this is not a good scenario . " looking for compromise the finnish leader said he expected the european commission to table a recommendation on turkey 's progress on the cyprus issue in the first week of december .
an eu decision on whether to suspend or continue membership negotiations would then be pushed to dec.11 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is trying to get turkish cypriots to open up ports finland is struggling to hammer out a compromise deal under which the turkish cypriot port of famagusta would be opened for trade with the eu in return for a move by ankara to allow greek cypriot ships into its harbors .
the internationally recognized republic of cyprus is controlled by the greek cypriot government in the south , with the northern third of the divided island recognized only by turkey . in spite of a customs deal that turkey has signed with all 25 member countries , ankara does not have diplomatic relations with cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 .
ankara has long argued that it will only comply with eu demands once the bloc ends its current economic boycott of the turkish portion of cyprus . trying to avert a crisis the finnish premier said he was trying hard to avert a crisis in the accession talks before germany assumes the six-month eu presidency . " the presidency still believes that a solution is possible , " said vanhanen , adding that it was still up to the united nations to try to reach a comprehensive settlement on the cyprus issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ther eu is not an " impartial broker , " acoording to turkish cypriot leader talat turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , who met with united nations chief kofi annan in geneva on monday , said the outgoing secretary general 's proposals remained the best hope for resolving the turkish-cypriot impasse and securing unification of the island . annan 's plan , which was approved by turkish cypriots in a 2004 referendum but rejected by the greek side , " continues to be the basis of any solution in the future , " talat told reporters . un help needed talat added that he did not see the european union as capable of reaching a solution , saying it could not act as an " impartial and honest broker " since both greece and the greek cypriot government were eu members . " unfortunately , the finnish plan is giving everything to the greek cypriots , " he said . talat conceded that he had received no guarantee from annan that the new secretary general , ban ki-moon , who takes over in january , would stick to the plan . even if the turkey-cyprus crisis is resolved , accession talks for the huge , secular country , which is predominantly muslim , are expected to take at least a decade . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers options in turkish accession talks eu foreign ministers were downbeat monday on the chance of a swift agreement from turkey to lift its trade embargo on cyprus to facilitate membership talks , as nicosia maintained a hard line .

" it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .

the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .
if they are too graphic in their descriptions then they run into the risk that many young people have access to the paradigm and the pattern and think , " hey , i will follow this . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 21.11.2006 secret paternity tests raise tough legal questions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's currently difficult for fathers to legally challenge paternity even as germany 's highest court examines the issues of secret paternity tests , the country 's justice minister brigitte zypries has called them unconstitutional and said they should be banned . speaking at a hearing of germany 's highest court , zypries said paternity tests carried out in secret impinged on a child 's rights .
she also said a new law currently being drafted by the german health ministry regulating genetic diagnostics would make it a punishable offence to carry out dna tests without a person 's knowledge . " it does n't matter if this affects the supposed father , or the employee or the insurance agency , " zypries said after the two-hour hearing at the constitutional court in karlsruhe . however , the minister added that the barriers for carrying out a paternity test should be lowered .
currently , a man has to have concrete proof for his suspicions before courts will order a paternity test - and he must do this within two years of the child 's birth . right to controlling personal information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing is easy to do , but is it legal ?
the constitutional court is hearing the case of a man who carried out a secret dna test because he did not believe he was the father of his ex-partner 's then 12-year-old daughter . the man , who name has not been released by the court , claimed he should not be legally responsible for the child after a test carried out on saliva taken from the girl 's chewing gum proved he is not biologically related to the girl . his claim was rejected by the federal court in january 2005 on the grounds that the testing of genetic material without permission contravenes people 's constitutional right to determine what happens with their personal information . now the father is arguing that he also has a constitutional right - in this case to know his exact relationship to the girl . genetic testing easily available the german states have differing opinions on how to balance a father 's desire to verify paternity against the right to genetic confidentiality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said many other eu countries have banned secret dna testing the southern german state of baden-württemberg wants to allow secret paternity testing whereas neighboring bavaria wants to prohibit the process .
however , a draft bavaria law proposes giving the father the possibility of compelling the child to take a genetic test . dna testing conducted by a private clinic in germany costs between 300 and 800 euros -lrb- $ 385 and $ 1,026 -rrb- , and it can be even cheaper on the internet . only a small piece of genetic material - such as a hair sample or saliva found a toothbrush - is necessary for the test , which is more than 99.9 percent accurate . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : courts right to bar secret testing a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.
saturday , hours that we are usually closed , " said store spokesman steffen ritter .
" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .

laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .
church officials such as bishop wolfgang huber , chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany told news agency dpa that the move was " a mistake " and a " cloak and dagger " operation . union leaders are grumbling , too .
currently , many large retailers , such as karstadtquelle and metro , are in negotiations with workers ' representatives to be able to stay open longer - union leaders say they want to find a way to get extra compensation for employees forced to work the later hours . as a result , most berlin retailers kept to their original store hours this weekend .
according to representatives from the karstadt , kadewe , wertheim and galleries lafayette department stores , it was n't possible to rearrange employee schedules so quickly , though they added that they hope to extend their hours by dec .

" it was a last minute decision , " said a butlers ' employee , adding that it was only decided saturday afternoon . some shoppers said they hoped that grocery stores would follow suit , while others said it would be great to be able to hit the shops on sundays all year round as well . for at least two shoppers , the new opening hours provided more than a chance to get some early christmas shopping done . a dussmann customer who declined to give his name whispered that he brought his blind date to the bookstore because it was a great way to get to know her : " it 's more comfortable than a bar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.11.2006 eu sets deadline for turkey to open up its ports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main obstacle to accession talks for turkey is its dispute with eu-member cyprus the eu believes that a solution to the turkish-cypriot dispute that threatens to derail membership talks for turkey to join the 25-member bloc is still possible with help from the united nations . the european union on monday gave ankara until early december to normalize relations with cyprus , before eu foreign ministers meet in brussels , on dec .
11 , to decide on turkey 's prospects for joining the 25-nation bloc . if turkey continues to refuse to meet the eu 's demands to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic , the country 's prospects for membership would face an " uncertain future , " said finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency . " time is running out .
if there is no agreement and turkey does not honor its commitments , the eu will need to consider the implications for the accession process , " vanhanen added .
" this is not a good scenario . " looking for compromise the finnish leader said he expected the european commission to table a recommendation on turkey 's progress on the cyprus issue in the first week of december .
an eu decision on whether to suspend or continue membership negotiations would then be pushed to dec.11 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is trying to get turkish cypriots to open up ports finland is struggling to hammer out a compromise deal under which the turkish cypriot port of famagusta would be opened for trade with the eu in return for a move by ankara to allow greek cypriot ships into its harbors .
the internationally recognized republic of cyprus is controlled by the greek cypriot government in the south , with the northern third of the divided island recognized only by turkey . in spite of a customs deal that turkey has signed with all 25 member countries , ankara does not have diplomatic relations with cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 .
ankara has long argued that it will only comply with eu demands once the bloc ends its current economic boycott of the turkish portion of cyprus . trying to avert a crisis the finnish premier said he was trying hard to avert a crisis in the accession talks before germany assumes the six-month eu presidency . " the presidency still believes that a solution is possible , " said vanhanen , adding that it was still up to the united nations to try to reach a comprehensive settlement on the cyprus issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ther eu is not an " impartial broker , " acoording to turkish cypriot leader talat turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , who met with united nations chief kofi annan in geneva on monday , said the outgoing secretary general 's proposals remained the best hope for resolving the turkish-cypriot impasse and securing unification of the island . annan 's plan , which was approved by turkish cypriots in a 2004 referendum but rejected by the greek side , " continues to be the basis of any solution in the future , " talat told reporters . un help needed talat added that he did not see the european union as capable of reaching a solution , saying it could not act as an " impartial and honest broker " since both greece and the greek cypriot government were eu members . " unfortunately , the finnish plan is giving everything to the greek cypriots , " he said . talat conceded that he had received no guarantee from annan that the new secretary general , ban ki-moon , who takes over in january , would stick to the plan . even if the turkey-cyprus crisis is resolved , accession talks for the huge , secular country , which is predominantly muslim , are expected to take at least a decade . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers options in turkish accession talks eu foreign ministers were downbeat monday on the chance of a swift agreement from turkey to lift its trade embargo on cyprus to facilitate membership talks , as nicosia maintained a hard line .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .

so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .
if they are too graphic in their descriptions then they run into the risk that many young people have access to the paradigm and the pattern and think , " hey , i will follow this . "

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .

the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser .

" " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .
in a study of the oecd countries , germany is in the second-to-last place when it comes to the proportion of students to school psychologists , bosbach told bayerischer rundfunk television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de technology -pipe- 21.11.2006 international nuclear fusion project agreed upon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could atomic power stations like these soon be history ?
an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .
" we are very confident that this thing will work .
we are putting fusion to the test .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.
saturday , hours that we are usually closed , " said store spokesman steffen ritter .
" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .
saxony-anhalt will start allowing round-the-clock shopping , except on sunday , from nov .

rhineland-palatinate , hesse , thuringia , brandenburg and schleswig-holstein plan to follow the trend on dec .
1 .

it was previously uncertain whether the teenager had shot himself or whether the pipe bombs attached to his body had exploded . at least 32 people were injured in monday 's shooting .
one of the school 's maintenance men suffered a gunshot wound in his stomach , and three girls and a boy , aged from 12 to 16 , were also shot . police said none of those injured was in critical condition , although two students were " seriously injured .

cet and began shooting at students . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 700 students were evacuated from the school the 18-year old then set off smoke bombs and retreated to the second floor of the building .
police later found him dead on the floor with two sawn-off shot guns lying next to him . police shocked to find explosives police found a knife and three pipe bombs wired together on the young man 's body . five more pipe bombs were discovered in his backpack and four in his car .
similar devices were found in the garage of the young man 's home .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser . " the message also contained the words , " i hate people , " and ended with the words , " i 'm outta here . " teachers in emsdetten said the attacker had been a loner who often dressed completely in black and wore a long , black trench coat . according to his former schoolmates , the young man was a fanatical player of the violent computer game " counter-strike . " calls for violent games to be banned in reaction to the shooting , politicians and teachers warned against increasing violence in films and computer games . the german teachers association president , josef kraus , said in the german daily bild that violent computer games led young people to believe that " the strongest achieve the quickest victories . " " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .
in a study of the oecd countries , germany is in the second-to-last place when it comes to the proportion of students to school psychologists , bosbach told bayerischer rundfunk television .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .

the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .

i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .

dw.world.de spoke to sociology professor klaus hurrelmann about how influential video games can be . following the shooting , wolfgang bosbach , the deputy head of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in parliament , said the government should consider a ban on games that simulate extreme killing . the discussion about prohibiting violent video games , specifically " counter-strike , " came to the fore following a school shooting in 2002 in the city of erfurt , where a former student shot and killed 16 before turning the gun on himself .
the ensuing debate contributed to changes to the media protection act for youths , which was altered to include more stringent guidelines for rating video games and expanded bans on " morally harmful " content . dw-world.de : do you think that blaming the shooting on violent video games is realistic ? klaus hurrelmann : we have to rely on research in this case , which says there is no lineal or causal relationship the computer games have to violent behavior .
we have , first , the vulnerable personality which really triggers violence and , second , finding a fitting context .
only if these things come together , the vicious circle begins .
that the young boy in this case has drifted away from reality and moves into the fictional world of the computer games and projects his experiences and his hate and aggressiveness to the school context , which in his eyes , is violating him and not giving him the support and perspective on life that he feels that he needs .
it is a triangulation . so it was a combination of factors , including his school and family , that influenced him ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooter was one of the few boys who will slip into a " fictional world " of violent games proof of this is that among 100 young boys who are playing " counter-strike , " there are 99 who really take this as a game , who may even benefit from it in thinking and strategy and intellectual development , and for one boy , in this case , there were detrimental consequences .
so it is not a mechanical relationship between playing aggressive computer games and becoming aggressive . what is your opinion of legislators or government focusing the blame for the shooting on these types of computer games - and the calls to ban them ? it is a thrilling idea to forbid computer games of this kind , and it is not below discussion for me .
-lrb- implementing legislation to ban games -rrb- certifies that we do not like games with the content that people are killed intensively and intentionally - the law would be of symbolic importance .
however , this law would not reach the one person i was speaking of in the example - this person always find ways to get access to computer games and is even stimulated by the law that would be forbidding use .
it is a difficult situation that we are facing . do you think the video game makers and those involved in the mass media have a responsibility to ensure images of violence are not perpetuated in such an extreme way ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent games " will always be accessed " even if they 're banned yes , and this is why computer games are only fascinating when killing is involved .
what about other content ?
what about very , very exciting financial transactions and maybe diplomatic situations that have to be resolved or personal conflict situations that have to be resolved with specific diplomatic and interactive and communicative skills ? we can have fantasies and even aggressive impulses that are part of human nature , and can be taken by games of that format and fulfilled and channeled in a civilized manner .
i do not believe that this desire can only be fulfilled by killing people . it is the responsibility of media , like the news media , to not report on these types of cases with a voyeuristic approach .
they should be very detached , be very clear , based only on news and try not to give the details for copying this act .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 21.11.2006 eu sets deadline for turkey to open up its ports großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main obstacle to accession talks for turkey is its dispute with eu-member cyprus the eu believes that a solution to the turkish-cypriot dispute that threatens to derail membership talks for turkey to join the 25-member bloc is still possible with help from the united nations . the european union on monday gave ankara until early december to normalize relations with cyprus , before eu foreign ministers meet in brussels , on dec .
11 , to decide on turkey 's prospects for joining the 25-nation bloc . if turkey continues to refuse to meet the eu 's demands to open its ports and airports to cypriot traffic , the country 's prospects for membership would face an " uncertain future , " said finnish prime minister matti vanhanen , whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency . " time is running out .
if there is no agreement and turkey does not honor its commitments , the eu will need to consider the implications for the accession process , " vanhanen added .
" this is not a good scenario . " looking for compromise the finnish leader said he expected the european commission to table a recommendation on turkey 's progress on the cyprus issue in the first week of december .
an eu decision on whether to suspend or continue membership negotiations would then be pushed to dec.11 , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is trying to get turkish cypriots to open up ports finland is struggling to hammer out a compromise deal under which the turkish cypriot port of famagusta would be opened for trade with the eu in return for a move by ankara to allow greek cypriot ships into its harbors .
the internationally recognized republic of cyprus is controlled by the greek cypriot government in the south , with the northern third of the divided island recognized only by turkey . in spite of a customs deal that turkey has signed with all 25 member countries , ankara does not have diplomatic relations with cyprus , which joined the eu in 2004 .
ankara has long argued that it will only comply with eu demands once the bloc ends its current economic boycott of the turkish portion of cyprus . trying to avert a crisis the finnish premier said he was trying hard to avert a crisis in the accession talks before germany assumes the six-month eu presidency . " the presidency still believes that a solution is possible , " said vanhanen , adding that it was still up to the united nations to try to reach a comprehensive settlement on the cyprus issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ther eu is not an " impartial broker , " acoording to turkish cypriot leader talat turkish cypriot leader mehmet ali talat , who met with united nations chief kofi annan in geneva on monday , said the outgoing secretary general 's proposals remained the best hope for resolving the turkish-cypriot impasse and securing unification of the island . annan 's plan , which was approved by turkish cypriots in a 2004 referendum but rejected by the greek side , " continues to be the basis of any solution in the future , " talat told reporters . un help needed talat added that he did not see the european union as capable of reaching a solution , saying it could not act as an " impartial and honest broker " since both greece and the greek cypriot government were eu members . " unfortunately , the finnish plan is giving everything to the greek cypriots , " he said . talat conceded that he had received no guarantee from annan that the new secretary general , ban ki-moon , who takes over in january , would stick to the plan . even if the turkey-cyprus crisis is resolved , accession talks for the huge , secular country , which is predominantly muslim , are expected to take at least a decade . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu considers options in turkish accession talks eu foreign ministers were downbeat monday on the chance of a swift agreement from turkey to lift its trade embargo on cyprus to facilitate membership talks , as nicosia maintained a hard line .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- eu foreign ministers to tackle turkey problem eu foreign ministers will discuss enlargement on monday , but turkey can expect little encouragement in its bid due to ankara 's trade embargo against cyprus and scathing criticism from the bloc 's executive arm .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.

" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .

laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .
church officials such as bishop wolfgang huber , chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany told news agency dpa that the move was " a mistake " and a " cloak and dagger " operation . union leaders are grumbling , too .
currently , many large retailers , such as karstadtquelle and metro , are in negotiations with workers ' representatives to be able to stay open longer - union leaders say they want to find a way to get extra compensation for employees forced to work the later hours . as a result , most berlin retailers kept to their original store hours this weekend .
according to representatives from the karstadt , kadewe , wertheim and galleries lafayette department stores , it was n't possible to rearrange employee schedules so quickly , though they added that they hope to extend their hours by dec .

" it was a last minute decision , " said a butlers ' employee , adding that it was only decided saturday afternoon . some shoppers said they hoped that grocery stores would follow suit , while others said it would be great to be able to hit the shops on sundays all year round as well . for at least two shoppers , the new opening hours provided more than a chance to get some early christmas shopping done . a dussmann customer who declined to give his name whispered that he brought his blind date to the bookstore because it was a great way to get to know her : " it 's more comfortable than a bar .

union officials said the job cuts would leave roughly 1,500 workers at the factory , but voiced fears that the lay-offs could be a prelude to full closure of the site . trade unions : the worst catastrophe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be history in brussels ?
" this is the worst catastrophe that we 've been through so far , " said pascal van cauwenberge , an official with the csc christian union at the factory .
" in my opinion , with 1,500 workers , volkswagen brussels is no longer viable .
it 's the first step before closure . " as tensions with management rise , unions called on workers to protest outside the plant tuesday afternoon . " we have the impression that we 've been abandoned by everybody , " said 43-year-old worker joseph de geyter while awaiting news with about 50 other colleagues at the entrance of the plant .

they added that production in germany would be " considerably cheaper . " " the car market in western europe is saturated and is struggling with overcapacity , " the statement said .
" despite increased market share , our western european plants are not operating at full capacity . " there was also little room for boosting export sales as a result of the strong euro and custom regulations in growth markets such as russia , india and china , vw said . eu to help affected workers ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu commission 's headquarters are located in brussels the auto giant did not specify how many jobs might be slashed , but it said that talks were underway with employee representatives at the forest site . " all economic alternatives are being explored with a view to securing as many jobs as possible in brussels , " the statement said . the european commission , which is also a major employer in brussels , is studying " a package of measures , " including making available eu structural funds , to help workers acquire new skills and aid suppliers restructure to focus on new markets , a spokesman said . the plant 's subcontractors employ about 10,000 people . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw blazing new trails with winterkorn behind the wheel the volkswagen board announced friday that audi head martin winterkorn will take over the corporation in the new year .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.
saturday , hours that we are usually closed , " said store spokesman steffen ritter .
" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .
saxony-anhalt will start allowing round-the-clock shopping , except on sunday , from nov .
30 .
rhineland-palatinate , hesse , thuringia , brandenburg and schleswig-holstein plan to follow the trend on dec .
1 .
laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions living planet -pipe- 21.11.2006 south africa lauches its first wind farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four wind turbines are being installed near cape town cape town has signed a 20-year contract to buy electricity from the country ’ s first ever commercial wind farm .
the city hopes to decrease its reliance on coal-fired power and combat global warming at the same time . the wind farm is under construction on south africa ’ s western cape in the small town of darling , about 70km north of cape town .
the darling wind farm is expected to provide electricity in 2007 .
the initial project is small scale and consists of only four turbines .
they ’ ll generate an estimated 13.3 gigawatt-hours per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the darling wind farm according to herman oelsner , the ceo of darling wind power , the pilot project might be small , but it ’ s a significant move .
" south africa is in the stone age worldwide in regard to wind energy , " he said .
" we have nothing commercially on the ground and with this first step , it ’ s so important that we get these four turbines down , " oeslner said .
he added that if the project runs as planned , 10-20 turbines could then be installed on the site .
coal will run out south africa ’ s coal reserves are running low , and for oelsner , wind power is a logical step .
" we won ’ t have any coal , so what are we going to do then ?
we have to use renewable energy and wind comes on a platter , " oelsner said .
the government will use the seven million euro wind project to study the technical , commercial and environmental viability of producing electricity from wind energy .
the scheme is a partnership between the south african and danish governments , the development bank of southern africa , the central energy fund and the darling independent power producing company .
council pushing for renewable energy cape town city council hopes to get 10 percent of its energy from sustainable sources by 2020 .
brian jones , a project engineer with the city ’ s electricity services said cape town wanted to " set an example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town 's energy needs are growing by seven percent annually " global warming is really affecting our climate and the city of cape town and the southern part of africa particularly are going to be affected by global warming in the future , more than the global average . "
jones said that with so much wind available in the western cape , wind energy was probably the most pragmatic way of sourcing renewable energy at the moment .
wind always blows the western cape is said to be perfect for wind energy because not only do the prevailing winds come from two directions , they also tend to blow during peak electricity consumption periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wind in cape town is n't just useful for paragliding according to consultant dirk ganz , wind represents some 85 percent of south africa ’ s renewable energy potential .
he believes by developing this resource , the country " would go a long way in actually solving its energy problems and in meeting the requirements of things like the kyoto protocol . "
" we have identified 25 sites in this country where we could actually look at the wind regimes in those areas , " ganz said , but added that extensive wind measurements and mapping still needed to be undertaken in these areas .
national government cautious wind is just one of the options the national government is investigating .
it ’ s also looking at the possibility of linking solar thermal power and wave energy to the national grid .
andre otto , director of renewable energy in the department of minerals and energy , said south africa wanted an energy mix rather than being " dependent on one energy source . "
" so that ’ s why we ’ re saying yes we have nuclear , we have fossil , we have renewable energy , " he said .
he added that it was necessary to be realistic about the practicalities of renewable energy in south africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is exploring different kinds of renewable energy " it ’ s at the beginning stages .
with renewable energy , the macro-economic impact studies we ’ ve done indicate that 40-48 percent of current electricity consumption can come from renewable energy .
but that ’ s technical potential , we still have to make it practical , " otto stressed .
south africa hopes to produce 10,000 gigawatt hours of green energy annually by 2013 .
that ’ s about enough electricity to run a small city .
in the meantime , the power purchase agreement with the darling wind farm has given the residents of cape town the opportunity to make a small , but positive contribution towards reducing global warming . glynis crook send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic south africa 's first wind farm feedback send us an e-mail .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions living planet -pipe- 21.11.2006 south africa lauches its first wind farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four wind turbines are being installed near cape town cape town has signed a 20-year contract to buy electricity from the country ’ s first ever commercial wind farm .
the city hopes to decrease its reliance on coal-fired power and combat global warming at the same time . the wind farm is under construction on south africa ’ s western cape in the small town of darling , about 70km north of cape town .
the darling wind farm is expected to provide electricity in 2007 .
the initial project is small scale and consists of only four turbines .
they ’ ll generate an estimated 13.3 gigawatt-hours per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the darling wind farm according to herman oelsner , the ceo of darling wind power , the pilot project might be small , but it ’ s a significant move .
" south africa is in the stone age worldwide in regard to wind energy , " he said .
" we have nothing commercially on the ground and with this first step , it ’ s so important that we get these four turbines down , " oeslner said .
he added that if the project runs as planned , 10-20 turbines could then be installed on the site .
coal will run out south africa ’ s coal reserves are running low , and for oelsner , wind power is a logical step .
" we won ’ t have any coal , so what are we going to do then ?
we have to use renewable energy and wind comes on a platter , " oelsner said .
the government will use the seven million euro wind project to study the technical , commercial and environmental viability of producing electricity from wind energy .
the scheme is a partnership between the south african and danish governments , the development bank of southern africa , the central energy fund and the darling independent power producing company .
council pushing for renewable energy cape town city council hopes to get 10 percent of its energy from sustainable sources by 2020 .
brian jones , a project engineer with the city ’ s electricity services said cape town wanted to " set an example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town 's energy needs are growing by seven percent annually " global warming is really affecting our climate and the city of cape town and the southern part of africa particularly are going to be affected by global warming in the future , more than the global average . "
jones said that with so much wind available in the western cape , wind energy was probably the most pragmatic way of sourcing renewable energy at the moment .
wind always blows the western cape is said to be perfect for wind energy because not only do the prevailing winds come from two directions , they also tend to blow during peak electricity consumption periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wind in cape town is n't just useful for paragliding according to consultant dirk ganz , wind represents some 85 percent of south africa ’ s renewable energy potential .
he believes by developing this resource , the country " would go a long way in actually solving its energy problems and in meeting the requirements of things like the kyoto protocol . "
" we have identified 25 sites in this country where we could actually look at the wind regimes in those areas , " ganz said , but added that extensive wind measurements and mapping still needed to be undertaken in these areas .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions living planet -pipe- 21.11.2006 south africa lauches its first wind farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four wind turbines are being installed near cape town cape town has signed a 20-year contract to buy electricity from the country ’ s first ever commercial wind farm .
the city hopes to decrease its reliance on coal-fired power and combat global warming at the same time . the wind farm is under construction on south africa ’ s western cape in the small town of darling , about 70km north of cape town .
the darling wind farm is expected to provide electricity in 2007 .
the initial project is small scale and consists of only four turbines .

it was previously uncertain whether the teenager had shot himself or whether the pipe bombs attached to his body had exploded . at least 32 people were injured in monday 's shooting .
one of the school 's maintenance men suffered a gunshot wound in his stomach , and three girls and a boy , aged from 12 to 16 , were also shot . police said none of those injured was in critical condition , although two students were " seriously injured .

police later found him dead on the floor with two sawn-off shot guns lying next to him . police shocked to find explosives police found a knife and three pipe bombs wired together on the young man 's body . five more pipe bombs were discovered in his backpack and four in his car .
similar devices were found in the garage of the young man 's home .
the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , said the presence of explosions in the school attack added a " new dimension " of brutality . " it is highly shocking , " freiberg said in the münstersche zeitung on tuesday . freiberg said he was outraged that an 18-year old even managed to get his hands on explosives .
" we need to explain what type of explosives they are and where they came from . " according to police , the young man 's father broke down after learning of the shooting and was taken to hospital .
the mother is reportedly suffering from shock . web site indicated gunman 's despair the gunman left a message on the internet that suggested the attack was retaliation for being mocked at the school in the town near the dutch border . police said web pages showed photos of the teenager holding weapons that appeared to be his own , including a submachine gun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gunman 's web site shows pictures of him with guns criticizing his former high school , the youth wrote , " the only thing i was properly taught at gss was that i 'm a loser .

" calls for violent games to be banned in reaction to the shooting , politicians and teachers warned against increasing violence in films and computer games . the german teachers association president , josef kraus , said in the german daily bild that violent computer games led young people to believe that " the strongest achieve the quickest victories . " " there is no place for the loser , " he said . this sentiment was echoed by the deputy chairman of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach , who called for a ban on violent games such as " counter-strike . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games such as counter-strike have been blamed for the rise in school shootings " if it really is true that the perpetrator played such killer games over a long period , then lawmakers finally have to do something , " bosbach said . four and a half years ago , a former school student of erfurt 's gutenberg high school killed 16 people and then himself .
at that time , violent games and films were seen as possible triggers for the deed . bosbach also criticized the lack of school psychologists .

an agreement was signed in paris for the construction of the international thermonuclear experimental reactor -lrb- iter -rrb- , the world 's first large-scale nuclear fusion reactor , which could potentially power a small city . representatives from a number of countries , including european union members , the united states , japan , russia , china and south korea attended the ceremony hosted by french president jacques chirac on tuesday . " if nothing changes , humanity will have consumed , in 200 years , most of the fossil fuels resources accumulated over hundreds of millions of years , " chirac said . depending on how the figures are calculated , the cost of the reactor is estimated at between $ 5 billion and $ 12 billion -lrb- 3.9 billion euros and 9.3 billion euros -rrb- , making it the second most expensive scientific project after the international space station .
the eu will be footing about half the bill with the other countries involved picking up the rest . however , didier gambier , the top european official in the iter consortium , told deutsche welle the costs had to be put into perspective .
he explained that 5 billion euros was not such a great investment compared with the annual earnings of major energy companies . it would " not be politically responsible to ignore the potential of nuclear fusion , " he added . the drawbacks of international cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear fusion brings two isotopes together to generate energy despite the common consensus about iter 's prospective benefits , the multi-lateral project has not been without its setbacks .
the united states temporarily withdrew from the project in 1999 , then returned in 2003 , while canada joined in 2001 and left two years later . there was also some disagreement , especially with japan , on where the reactor should be built .
finally , the project 's eu base in the southern french city of cadarache , near marseille , was chosen as the location . japan agreed to send some of the 400 scientists needed for the project to france and in exchange for some of the procurement coming from japan .
germany will provide the expertise necessary for building the inner walls of the fusion chamber . potential energy source of the future if successfully finished , the plant will create energy by replicating the process that takes place inside the sun .
instead of splitting the atom , the project seeks to release energy light atomic nuclei - the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium - are fused together to form heavier atomic nuclei . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the joint european taurus nuclear power station to use controlled fusion reactions on earth as an energy source , it is necessary to heat a gas to temperatures exceeding 100 million celsius - many times hotter than the centre of the sun . one of the attractions of fusion is the tiny amount of fuel needed .
the release of energy from a fusion reaction is 10 million times greater than from a typical chemical reaction , such as burning a fossil fuel . chirac said the experimental reactor was " a hand held out to future generations " and predicted that , if it proved successful , " we will be able to derive as much energy from a liter of seawater as from a liter of petrol or a kilo of coal . " fusion technology questioned those in favor of nuclear fusion hope to win over a skeptical public by emphasizing the technology 's potential to solve the world 's energy problems without producing large amounts of greenhouse gases or nuclear waste .
the skeptics , however , point out that similar claims were made about nuclear fission and argue that it could take too much time before a commercially viable reactor is built . the project has been criticized by environmental groups like greenpeace , who argue that the enormous cost will suck funds away from other areas of alternative energy research , with no guarantee that an effective method of simulating and harnessing the fusion process will ever be found . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jet could be the new face of nuclear power since the 1950s , scientists have been creating increasingly large experiments that started off as big as a human hand and gradually progressing to a size of about 10 meters -lrb- about 33 feet -rrb- high , like the joint european taurus -lrb- jet -rrb- in culham in the united kingdom , which generates roughly about as much energy as it consumes . " iter is twice the size of jet and that step needed to be taken to generate ten times more energy than it consumes , " said mark tiele westra , an iter 's spokesman .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.

" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .

laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .
church officials such as bishop wolfgang huber , chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany told news agency dpa that the move was " a mistake " and a " cloak and dagger " operation . union leaders are grumbling , too .
currently , many large retailers , such as karstadtquelle and metro , are in negotiations with workers ' representatives to be able to stay open longer - union leaders say they want to find a way to get extra compensation for employees forced to work the later hours . as a result , most berlin retailers kept to their original store hours this weekend .
according to representatives from the karstadt , kadewe , wertheim and galleries lafayette department stores , it was n't possible to rearrange employee schedules so quickly , though they added that they hope to extend their hours by dec .

" it was a last minute decision , " said a butlers ' employee , adding that it was only decided saturday afternoon . some shoppers said they hoped that grocery stores would follow suit , while others said it would be great to be able to hit the shops on sundays all year round as well . for at least two shoppers , the new opening hours provided more than a chance to get some early christmas shopping done . a dussmann customer who declined to give his name whispered that he brought his blind date to the bookstore because it was a great way to get to know her : " it 's more comfortable than a bar .

bavarian farmer harvests energy kenya signs historical emissions agreement australia turns to cleaning coal to lower emissions living planet -pipe- 21.11.2006 south africa lauches its first wind farm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : four wind turbines are being installed near cape town cape town has signed a 20-year contract to buy electricity from the country ’ s first ever commercial wind farm .
the city hopes to decrease its reliance on coal-fired power and combat global warming at the same time . the wind farm is under construction on south africa ’ s western cape in the small town of darling , about 70km north of cape town .
the darling wind farm is expected to provide electricity in 2007 .
the initial project is small scale and consists of only four turbines .
they ’ ll generate an estimated 13.3 gigawatt-hours per year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the darling wind farm according to herman oelsner , the ceo of darling wind power , the pilot project might be small , but it ’ s a significant move .
" south africa is in the stone age worldwide in regard to wind energy , " he said .
" we have nothing commercially on the ground and with this first step , it ’ s so important that we get these four turbines down , " oeslner said .
he added that if the project runs as planned , 10-20 turbines could then be installed on the site .
coal will run out south africa ’ s coal reserves are running low , and for oelsner , wind power is a logical step .
" we won ’ t have any coal , so what are we going to do then ?
we have to use renewable energy and wind comes on a platter , " oelsner said .
the government will use the seven million euro wind project to study the technical , commercial and environmental viability of producing electricity from wind energy .
the scheme is a partnership between the south african and danish governments , the development bank of southern africa , the central energy fund and the darling independent power producing company .
council pushing for renewable energy cape town city council hopes to get 10 percent of its energy from sustainable sources by 2020 .
brian jones , a project engineer with the city ’ s electricity services said cape town wanted to " set an example . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cape town 's energy needs are growing by seven percent annually " global warming is really affecting our climate and the city of cape town and the southern part of africa particularly are going to be affected by global warming in the future , more than the global average . "
jones said that with so much wind available in the western cape , wind energy was probably the most pragmatic way of sourcing renewable energy at the moment .
wind always blows the western cape is said to be perfect for wind energy because not only do the prevailing winds come from two directions , they also tend to blow during peak electricity consumption periods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wind in cape town is n't just useful for paragliding according to consultant dirk ganz , wind represents some 85 percent of south africa ’ s renewable energy potential .
he believes by developing this resource , the country " would go a long way in actually solving its energy problems and in meeting the requirements of things like the kyoto protocol . "
" we have identified 25 sites in this country where we could actually look at the wind regimes in those areas , " ganz said , but added that extensive wind measurements and mapping still needed to be undertaken in these areas .
national government cautious wind is just one of the options the national government is investigating .
it ’ s also looking at the possibility of linking solar thermal power and wave energy to the national grid .
andre otto , director of renewable energy in the department of minerals and energy , said south africa wanted an energy mix rather than being " dependent on one energy source . "
" so that ’ s why we ’ re saying yes we have nuclear , we have fossil , we have renewable energy , " he said .
he added that it was necessary to be realistic about the practicalities of renewable energy in south africa .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south africa is exploring different kinds of renewable energy " it ’ s at the beginning stages .
with renewable energy , the macro-economic impact studies we ’ ve done indicate that 40-48 percent of current electricity consumption can come from renewable energy .
but that ’ s technical potential , we still have to make it practical , " otto stressed .
south africa hopes to produce 10,000 gigawatt hours of green energy annually by 2013 .
that ’ s about enough electricity to run a small city .
in the meantime , the power purchase agreement with the darling wind farm has given the residents of cape town the opportunity to make a small , but positive contribution towards reducing global warming . glynis crook send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic south africa 's first wind farm feedback send us an e-mail .

she also said a new law currently being drafted by the german health ministry regulating genetic diagnostics would make it a punishable offence to carry out dna tests without a person 's knowledge . " it does n't matter if this affects the supposed father , or the employee or the insurance agency , " zypries said after the two-hour hearing at the constitutional court in karlsruhe . however , the minister added that the barriers for carrying out a paternity test should be lowered .

the constitutional court is hearing the case of a man who carried out a secret dna test because he did not believe he was the father of his ex-partner 's then 12-year-old daughter . the man , who name has not been released by the court , claimed he should not be legally responsible for the child after a test carried out on saliva taken from the girl 's chewing gum proved he is not biologically related to the girl . his claim was rejected by the federal court in january 2005 on the grounds that the testing of genetic material without permission contravenes people 's constitutional right to determine what happens with their personal information . now the father is arguing that he also has a constitutional right - in this case to know his exact relationship to the girl . genetic testing easily available the german states have differing opinions on how to balance a father 's desire to verify paternity against the right to genetic confidentiality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries said many other eu countries have banned secret dna testing the southern german state of baden-württemberg wants to allow secret paternity testing whereas neighboring bavaria wants to prohibit the process .
however , a draft bavaria law proposes giving the father the possibility of compelling the child to take a genetic test . dna testing conducted by a private clinic in germany costs between 300 and 800 euros -lrb- $ 385 and $ 1,026 -rrb- , and it can be even cheaper on the internet . only a small piece of genetic material - such as a hair sample or saliva found a toothbrush - is necessary for the test , which is more than 99.9 percent accurate . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : opinion : courts right to bar secret testing a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .

one store even threw a party . shoppers who crowded into the large dussmann bookstore in the center of berlin friday night were greeted by live jazz , complimentary croissants and champagne .
lines of customers waited as cashiers tried to keep up while other shoppers nearby perused books and cds . other than the music and free food and drinks , it could have been any ordinary night at the perennially busy bookstore except for one thing : the clock in the bookstore had long since struck midnight . this weekend , dussmann became one of the first german retailers to take advantage of a new law passed by the berlin senate a few weeks ago that allows stores to be open 24 hours from monday to saturday and for 10 sundays annually . store officials said the decision to stay open all night with the " shop closing hours killer party " had paid off . customers happy shopping into the wee hours " we had about 6,000 shoppers pass through from 10 p.m.
friday to 10 a.m.
saturday , hours that we are usually closed , " said store spokesman steffen ritter .
" it is like the days just before christmas . " though analysts disagree on whether longer hours will have an impact on shopping habits , people out late over the weekend said they were pleased with the change . " i ca n't usually make it to stores by 8 p.m. because of work , " said frank dederichs , who was examining jazz cds at dussmann .
" besides , this is a great way to relax . " a revolutionary change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores , such as galeries lafayette , hope to extend their hours in a country that has only extended shopping hours to 8 p.m. on weekdays and saturdays in the past decade , the change is revolutionary . new opening hours came about after federal lawmakers , who are trying to streamline regulations and boost the economy , liberalized germany 's shopping law by allowing the 16 federal states to set their own limits on when stores can open - and close - their doors .
so far , all the states , with the exception of bavaria and saarland , have considered extending shopping hours . retailers in the largest state , north rhine-westphalia , can open until 10 p.m. from monday to saturday starting on tuesday .

laden with a debt 62 billion euros -lrb- $ 84 billion -rrb- and an official unemployment rate hovering near 17 percent , officials in the capital city said they hope longer opening hours will stimulate demand , create jobs and add tax revenue to the city ’ s coffers . but retail experts warn that it will take time to measure the results , particularly because the change is occurring just before the busy christmas shopping season . some still grumbling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber has criticized the move regardless of how much money the new law could bring in , some are not pleased with the changes .
church officials such as bishop wolfgang huber , chairman of the council of the protestant church in germany told news agency dpa that the move was " a mistake " and a " cloak and dagger " operation . union leaders are grumbling , too .
currently , many large retailers , such as karstadtquelle and metro , are in negotiations with workers ' representatives to be able to stay open longer - union leaders say they want to find a way to get extra compensation for employees forced to work the later hours . as a result , most berlin retailers kept to their original store hours this weekend .
according to representatives from the karstadt , kadewe , wertheim and galleries lafayette department stores , it was n't possible to rearrange employee schedules so quickly , though they added that they hope to extend their hours by dec .

" it was a last minute decision , " said a butlers ' employee , adding that it was only decided saturday afternoon . some shoppers said they hoped that grocery stores would follow suit , while others said it would be great to be able to hit the shops on sundays all year round as well . for at least two shoppers , the new opening hours provided more than a chance to get some early christmas shopping done . a dussmann customer who declined to give his name whispered that he brought his blind date to the bookstore because it was a great way to get to know her : " it 's more comfortable than a bar .

intelligence agency studies had found few cases , if any , where it would have made a big difference , sir swinton thomas told bbc radio 4 's file on 4 .
he said changing the law could harm law enforcement and security services .
but director of public prosecutions ken macdonald said intercept material could help build stronger cases .
the number of cases where intercept material would make a substantial difference are very few indeed or possibly even non-existent sir swinton thomas interception of communications commissioner sir swinton , the outgoing interception of communications commissioner , said mi5 , mi6 and gchq had carried out extensive trials to check if intercept material would be valuable in prosecutions .
" those inquiries have shown very clearly that the number of cases where intercept material would make a substantial difference are very few indeed or possibly even non-existent , " he said .
the dpp and the attorney general both support a change in the law to allow intercepted phone calls , e-mails and letters to be used in prosecutions of people suspected of terrorism and organised crime .
but sir swinton said : " i would certainly disagree with them .
i feel this very strongly because i think it is so enormously important from the point of view of protecting the citizens of this country from terrorism .
" i deeply believe that if there is a change in the law , huge advantages which the security services and law enforcement agencies have at present would be lost . "

mr murdoch said he was " sorry for any pain this has caused " .
mr simpson was acquitted of murdering ex-wife nicole brown simpson and her friend ronald goldman on 12 june 1994 .
judith regan , publisher of reganbooks , owned by mr murdoch 's news corp , had said she considered the book mr simpson 's confession .
several affiliates of mr murdoch 's fox tv had refused to screen the interview on the grounds of bad taste .
mr murdoch said : " i and senior management agree with the american public that this was an ill-considered project .
i would like nothing better than to straighten out some things that have been mischaracterised oj simpson " we are sorry for any pain that this has caused the families of ron goldman and nicole brown simpson . "
the tv programme was intended to promote the ex-american footballer 's book , which was planned for publication on 30 november .
the deal with mr murdoch 's broadcasting and publishing companies was worth $ 3.5m -lrb- £ 1.85m -rrb- .
during the interview , mr simpson describes how he would have carried out the murders at his ex-wife 's home in los angeles " if he were the one responsible " .
fox tv had scheduled the simpson interview to air on 27 and 29 november .
there are about 200 fox affiliates across the us .
' legally muzzled ' the family of ronald goldman acknowledged news corp had accepted " responsibility for its deplorable decisions " but said the cancellation did " not undo the damage to the families of the victims " .
the family said it wanted hold " those persons accountable who may have acted in concert with simpson to defraud the goldmans " .
mr simpson 's lawyer portrayed the case as a conspiracy mr simpson told the associated press he could not comment .
" i would like nothing better than to straighten out some things that have been mischaracterised .
but i think i 'm legally muzzled at this point , " he said .
mr simpson 's lawyer , yale galanter , said his client was " totally indifferent " about the cancellations .
the 1995 verdict had divided us opinion along racial lines , with most white people feeling that justice had not been done .
mr simpson was later found liable for the deaths in a civil trial and ordered to pay $ 33.5m in damages - money that has never been collected .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says the civil trial result and america 's constitutional freedom of speech rights have enabled people to openly say they believe mr simpson is a murderer .
mr simpson would have faced no further penalty as a result of the book or interview .

the guardian newspaper poll of 1,026 gps and hospital doctors found many doubted the security of the new system .
four out of five thought the confidentiality of their patients ' records would be at risk .
the government hopes the new database will store medical information on about 50 million patients in england .
the electronic warehouse , dubbed spine , is part of the nhs 's £ 12bn it upgrade , which aims to link up 30,000 gps to nearly 300 hospitals and give patients access to their personal health and care information .
eventually , around 1.2 million healthcare professionals could have access to some of the information on the system , including nurses , dentists and pharmacists .
the guardian poll found that while most gps believed a national electronic record would bring clinical benefits to patients , 51 % were unwilling to allow people 's data to be uploaded without their permission .
more than 60 % said they feared the system would be vulnerable to hackers and unauthorised access by public officials from outside the nhs and social care .
explicit consent doctors were also concerned about the potential for bribery or blackmail , and about clinicians not adhering to the rules .
ministers had assumed doctors would provide the information for the database without asking their patients ' permission first .
the british medical association told the guardian : " we share the concerns of the gps responding to the poll .
" we are worried patients are not going to have all the information they need to know what is going on with their records .
" that is why we are in favour of a system that seeks their explicit consent . "
a spokesman for connecting for health , the agency responsible for the nhs it upgrade , told the guardian : " the law constrains how a national database must operate , but it does not prevent the creation of such a database , nor does it prevent the merger of existing databases for efficiency and safety reasons , as is being done to create the central summary clinical record .
" the department of health believes that this will be of great benefit to a great majority of people , improving healthcare and preventing unnecessary deaths . "
local information campaigns will tell patients they can deny nhs staff access to their medical details , but doing so may damage their chances of getting the best treatment .
however , once the record is stored on the spine , there will be no way of deleting it .

the guardian poll found that while most gps believed a national electronic record would bring clinical benefits to patients , 51 % were unwilling to allow people 's data to be uploaded without their permission .
more than 60 % said they feared the system would be vulnerable to hackers and unauthorised access by public officials from outside the nhs and social care .
explicit consent doctors were also concerned about the potential for bribery or blackmail , and about clinicians not adhering to the rules .
ministers had assumed doctors would provide the information for the database without asking their patients ' permission first .
the british medical association told the guardian : " we share the concerns of the gps responding to the poll .
" we are worried patients are not going to have all the information they need to know what is going on with their records .
" that is why we are in favour of a system that seeks their explicit consent . "
a spokesman for connecting for health , the agency responsible for the nhs it upgrade , told the guardian : " the law constrains how a national database must operate , but it does not prevent the creation of such a database , nor does it prevent the merger of existing databases for efficiency and safety reasons , as is being done to create the central summary clinical record .
" the department of health believes that this will be of great benefit to a great majority of people , improving healthcare and preventing unnecessary deaths . "
local information campaigns will tell patients they can deny nhs staff access to their medical details , but doing so may damage their chances of getting the best treatment .
however , once the record is stored on the spine , there will be no way of deleting it .

the battle for the top spot will be fiercely contested , but what can you expect from the three compilations ?
the beatles - love who are they ?
arguably the most influential rock group of all time , the beatles were four young lads from liverpool who changed the way music is played and recorded .
you might have heard of them .
the album : love features 37 beatles songs in a brand-new continuous mix , put together by legendary producer george martin .
it is also the soundtrack to a beatles-themed show by cirque de soleil .
key tracks : there are almost too many to choose from , but the cd includes yesterday , blackbird and the not-at-all-about-drugs psychedelic anthem lucy in the sky with diamonds .
added value : for an extra £ 5 , you get a bonus dvd with the entire album mixed in surround sound .
the press release : " a vivid , intimate and powerful entertainment experience . "
previous greatest hits : this is the eighth album to bring together the beatles ' hits - or the 11th if you include the anthology series , which compiled out-takes and demos .
sales record : the beatles ' last greatest hits album , 1 , sold 2.7m copies in the uk .
random beatles quote : " we sold out , you know .
the music was dead before we even went on a theatre tour of britain . "
-lrb- john lennon in rolling stone , 1970 -rrb- oasis - stop the clocks who are they ?
the gallagher brothers , liam and noel , plus an ever-changing group of backing musicians , who go by names such as gem and bonehead .
the album : stop the clocks is a double album stuffed to the gills with the songs that helped define britpop .
they were hand-picked by the band -lrb- noel -rrb- , which means you get album tracks and b-sides alongside the singles .
key tracks : jukebox classics do n't look back in anger and wonderwall will be sung at closing time until the day you die .
but some of oasis ' bigger hits , including whatever and roll with it , are missing .
added value : a limited edition 3-disc edition is also available , containing a dvd with live performances and an interview with the gallaghers .
the japanese version of the album features two extra tracks .
the press release : " this is not a full stop , but merely a time out ; a dream set list , and a chance for the world to review the immense contribution that oasis have made and continue to make to rock 'n'roll . "
previous greatest hits : oasis say they will never release a true greatest hits album until they split up -lrb- this counts as a best of , apparently -rrb- , but they do have a compilation of b-sides , called the masterplan .
sales record : the band 's second album , -lrb- what 's the story -rrb- morning glory , has sold more than 4.3m copies , making it the third biggest-selling album ever in the uk .
random oasis quote : " i was n't taught music by anybody .
i did n't learn music at school .
i ca n't play the piano . "
-lrb- noel gallagher in the times , 2001 -rrb- u2 - 18 singles who are they ?
the irish four-piece who stole the show at live aid , reinvented stadium rock , and put an end to poverty -lrb- tbc -rrb- .
the album : as the title suggests , 18 singles features 18 of u2 's biggest singles from the last 20 years .
two of the songs have been specially recorded for the collection .
key tracks : the world 's most heart-rending ballad , one , and the world 's second most heart-rending ballad , with or without you .
added value : brilliantly , the uk version of the cd has a bonus track - which instantly renders the album 's title nonsensical .
a special edition comes with a 10-track live dvd recorded in milan .
the press release : " u2 18 singles is the first single-disc collection to span the band 's 26-year career . "
previous greatest hits : two earlier volumes of u2 's greatest hits cover the band 's singles from the 1980s and 1990s .
completists can also buy every track the band have ever recorded - and there are 446 of them - on itunes for the bargain basement price of £ 120 .
sales record : u2 's previous greatest hits compilations have sold more than 2m copies .

arguably the most influential rock group of all time , the beatles were four young lads from liverpool who changed the way music is played and recorded .
you might have heard of them .
the album : love features 37 beatles songs in a brand-new continuous mix , put together by legendary producer george martin .
it is also the soundtrack to a beatles-themed show by cirque de soleil .
key tracks : there are almost too many to choose from , but the cd includes yesterday , blackbird and the not-at-all-about-drugs psychedelic anthem lucy in the sky with diamonds .
added value : for an extra £ 5 , you get a bonus dvd with the entire album mixed in surround sound .
in 1996 , the three remaining beatles compiled the anthology cds the press release : " a vivid , intimate and powerful entertainment experience . "

the gallagher brothers , liam and noel , plus an ever-changing group of backing musicians , who go by names such as gem and bonehead .
the album : stop the clocks is a double album stuffed to the gills with the songs that helped define britpop .

key tracks : jukebox classics do n't look back in anger and wonderwall will be sung at closing time until the day you die .

iter will produce relatively clean energy what is iter -lrb- international thermonuclear experimental reactor , or " the way " in latin -rrb- ?
iter is an experimental reactor that will attempt to reproduce on earth the nuclear reactions that power the sun and other stars .
it will consolidate all that has been learnt over many decades of study .
if it works , and the technologies are proven to be practical , the international community will then build a prototype commercial reactor , dubbed demo .
the final step would be to roll out fusion technology across the globe .
what exactly is fusion ?
fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them , as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations .
in the core of the sun , huge gravitational pressure allows this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million celsius .
at the much lower pressure that is possible on earth , temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million celsius .
no materials on earth could withstand direct contact with such heat .
to achieve fusion , therefore , scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas , or plasma , is held and squeezed inside an intense doughnut-shaped magnetic field .
what are the advantages of fusion ?
the best fuel for fusion comprises two types , or isotopes , of hydrogen : deuterium and tritium .
the former can be derived from water which is abundant and available everywhere .
the latter can be produced from lithium , which is plentiful in the earth 's crust .
unlike the burning of fossil fuels , fusion reactions produce no carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for warming the planet -lrb- ancillary activities such as construction will , of course -rrb- .
fusion scientists also say the system would be inherently safe because any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown .
will iter produce radioactive waste ?
yes .
the neutrons produced in fusion reactions will " activate " the materials used in the walls of iter 's plasma chamber .
but one of the project 's tasks will be to find the materials that best withstand this bombardment .
this could result in waste materials that are safe to handle in a relatively modest timescale -lrb- 50-100 years -rrb- , compared with the much longer lived radioactive waste -lrb- many thousands of years -rrb- produced as a direct result of splitting atoms in fission reactions .
it has been calculated that after 100 years of post-operation radioactive decay , iter will be left with about 6,000 tonnes of waste .
when packaged , this would be equivalent to a cube with about 10m edges .
how soon will iter be built ?
in 2005 , the iter partners agreed to site the reactor at cadarache in southern france after a long period of negotiation .
ministers have now signed an agreement that puts in place the legal framework for the project .
how much will iter cost ?
iter construction costs are estimated at 4.57bn euros -lrb- at 2000 prices -rrb- , to be spread over about 10 years .
estimated total operating costs over the expected operational lifetime of about 20 years are of a similar order .
how will iter be financed ?
as the host , the eu will shoulder 50 % of the construction costs , the rest being shared by other partners .
because japan agreed to stand aside in favour of cadarache , it gets favourable terms .
japan will get to host a related materials research facility - of which half the construction costs will also be shouldered by the eu .
japanese scientists will get a larger share of iter 's research posts , too .
in addition , the japanese nuclear engineer and diplomat kaname ikeda is the nominated director general of the project .
why was the eu so keen to host the reactor ?
iter will require considerable investment from the partners , but the potential pay-offs are thought to be well worth it .
hosting the experimental reactor will put the eu at the front of the queue to take commercial advantage of fusion .
the project is expected to generate more than 10,000 jobs and the expertise developed on iter will allow europe to reap the benefits of spin-off technologies .
why is fusion energy seen to be so desirable ?
we can not rely on fossil fuels indefinitely .
firstly , supplies of oil , coal and gas are finite and will eventually run down .
secondly , the greenhouse gases produced through the burning of fossil fuels are a major driver of climate change , scientists believe .
however , demand for energy is also increasing .
in 1990 , about 75 % of the world 's population -lrb- those in the developing countries -rrb- were responsible for only 33 % of the world 's energy consumption .
by the year 2020 , that 75 % could have risen to 85 % and the energy consumption to around 55 % .
thus , there will be greater competition for the fuel resources available .
some think fusion will provide a relatively safe , green alternative to fossil fuels ; enabling the production of vast amounts of energy from abundant sources .
when will the first commercial fusion reactor be built ?

iter will produce relatively clean energy what is iter -lrb- international thermonuclear experimental reactor , or " the way " in latin -rrb- ?
iter is an experimental reactor that will attempt to reproduce on earth the nuclear reactions that power the sun and other stars .
it will consolidate all that has been learnt over many decades of study .
if it works , and the technologies are proven to be practical , the international community will then build a prototype commercial reactor , dubbed demo .
the final step would be to roll out fusion technology across the globe .
what exactly is fusion ?
fusion works on the principle that energy can be released by forcing together atomic nuclei rather than by splitting them , as in the case of the fission reactions that drive existing nuclear power stations .
in the core of the sun , huge gravitational pressure allows this to happen at temperatures of around 10 million celsius .
at the much lower pressure that is possible on earth , temperatures to produce fusion need to be much higher - above 100 million celsius .
no materials on earth could withstand direct contact with such heat .
to achieve fusion , therefore , scientists have devised a solution in which a super-heated gas , or plasma , is held and squeezed inside an intense doughnut-shaped magnetic field .
what are the advantages of fusion ?
the best fuel for fusion comprises two types , or isotopes , of hydrogen : deuterium and tritium .
the former can be derived from water which is abundant and available everywhere .
the latter can be produced from lithium , which is plentiful in the earth 's crust .
unlike the burning of fossil fuels , fusion reactions produce no carbon dioxide , the greenhouse gas blamed by scientists for warming the planet -lrb- ancillary activities such as construction will , of course -rrb- .
fusion scientists also say the system would be inherently safe because any malfunction would result in a rapid shutdown .
will iter produce radioactive waste ?
yes .
the neutrons produced in fusion reactions will " activate " the materials used in the walls of iter 's plasma chamber .
but one of the project 's tasks will be to find the materials that best withstand this bombardment .
this could result in waste materials that are safe to handle in a relatively modest timescale -lrb- 50-100 years -rrb- , compared with the much longer lived radioactive waste -lrb- many thousands of years -rrb- produced as a direct result of splitting atoms in fission reactions .
it has been calculated that after 100 years of post-operation radioactive decay , iter will be left with about 6,000 tonnes of waste .
when packaged , this would be equivalent to a cube with about 10m edges .
how soon will iter be built ?
in 2005 , the iter partners agreed to site the reactor at cadarache in southern france after a long period of negotiation .
ministers have now signed an agreement that puts in place the legal framework for the project .
how much will iter cost ?
iter construction costs are estimated at 4.57bn euros -lrb- at 2000 prices -rrb- , to be spread over about 10 years .
estimated total operating costs over the expected operational lifetime of about 20 years are of a similar order .
how will iter be financed ?
as the host , the eu will shoulder 50 % of the construction costs , the rest being shared by other partners .
because japan agreed to stand aside in favour of cadarache , it gets favourable terms .
japan will get to host a related materials research facility - of which half the construction costs will also be shouldered by the eu .
japanese scientists will get a larger share of iter 's research posts , too .
in addition , the japanese nuclear engineer and diplomat kaname ikeda is the nominated director general of the project .
why was the eu so keen to host the reactor ?
iter will require considerable investment from the partners , but the potential pay-offs are thought to be well worth it .
hosting the experimental reactor will put the eu at the front of the queue to take commercial advantage of fusion .
the project is expected to generate more than 10,000 jobs and the expertise developed on iter will allow europe to reap the benefits of spin-off technologies .
why is fusion energy seen to be so desirable ?
we can not rely on fossil fuels indefinitely .
firstly , supplies of oil , coal and gas are finite and will eventually run down .
secondly , the greenhouse gases produced through the burning of fossil fuels are a major driver of climate change , scientists believe .
however , demand for energy is also increasing .
in 1990 , about 75 % of the world 's population -lrb- those in the developing countries -rrb- were responsible for only 33 % of the world 's energy consumption .
by the year 2020 , that 75 % could have risen to 85 % and the energy consumption to around 55 % .
thus , there will be greater competition for the fuel resources available .
some think fusion will provide a relatively safe , green alternative to fossil fuels ; enabling the production of vast amounts of energy from abundant sources .
when will the first commercial fusion reactor be built ?
not for a long time .
