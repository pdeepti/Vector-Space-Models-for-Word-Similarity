but when concerts , movie clips and soccer games are shown , touchy copyright questions come up . the german society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights -lrb- gema -rrb- has demanded that google either pay royalties for publishing copyrighted material on youtube or erase it . google , which bought the one-and-a-half year-old video portal in early october for $ 1.65 billion , has apparently agreed to gema 's stipulation .
" of course we will respect and protect copyrights , " said spokesman stefan keuchel . monitoring nearly impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can google meet copyright laws while maintaining the essence of youtube ?
however , since it is individual users put the videos online and not google , this is easier said than done .
some 70,000 new videos are uploaded by private users each day . currently there is no preliminary screening to prevent the upload of copyrighted videos . " we 're not going to wait for the negotiations .
we 've already made google aware of the copyright violations on youtube that affect our members , " a spokesperson from the music society told german daily newspaper handelsblatt this week . the music industry is now hoping to avoid a never-ending legal battle similar to the case with the music exchange portal napster . music industry not alone gema is the first major music industry association trying to settle copyright claims with youtube , but not the only party seeking legal action . both the german soccer league and the soccer club fc bayern munich have also announced that they will not overlook copyright violations on youtube . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc bayern munich do n't want to let go of exclusive video rights to their games fc bayern munich markets their own games on the website fcb.tv and draws around 30,000 subscribers .
the soccer club 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said he sees pirated game clips as a violation of their " exclusive rights " to video broadcasting . the german soccer league has hired a private company called netresult to detect video recordings online that violate their copyright . google has not proved unresponsive to legal concerns .
last month nearly 30,000 files were deleted when a japanese publishing organization complained of copyright infringement on youtube . " youtube is a great thing " the biggest challenge , it seems , will be to find a balance between satisfying copyright laws and maintaining the essence of youtube 's - that video exchange is freely accessible to all . " youtube is a great thing , " stefan weikert , a manager at edel music told handelsblatt .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .
dr. hauschka 's adam notes that with four tons of rose petals needed to make just a kilo of rose oil - a key ingredient in its top-selling rose moisturizing lotion - the " amount of organic rose petals we can buy on the world market is limited . " and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon . after an extended tug-of-war , the german government voted thursday to ban tobacco advertising . this week 's decision ends tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines and the internet , as well as for sports that are broadcast on television .
since 1974 , tobacco advertising has been banned on radio and television .
it will continue to be allowed in some cases , such as in movie theaters and on billboards . while a large majority of parliament supported the advertising ban , the decision was delayed for more than a year .
publishers and advertisers had fought hard against the advertising ban and criticized thursday 's decision , according to the dpa . while the measure easily passed germany 's lower house of parliament , the free democrat party , a free-market liberal party , voted against the ban .
it patronizes consumers and forbids advertising for a legal substance , the fdp said . further smoking bans likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pubs might be excluded from smoking bans further smoking regulations are in the works .
a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-
the ruling coalition of the spd and christian democratic union are still negotiating possible exemptions and legal ramifications of the law , she said . decision angers industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers are included in the ban the new tobacco advertising ban could decrease the amount of tobacco-related taxes the government takes in as well as cut into advertising profits .
the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .

" we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .
dr. hauschka 's adam notes that with four tons of rose petals needed to make just a kilo of rose oil - a key ingredient in its top-selling rose moisturizing lotion - the " amount of organic rose petals we can buy on the world market is limited . " and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

24 in helsinki . european commission spokeswoman on external affairs , emma udwin , acknowledged on friday " polish reserves " over the issue , but added that " the discussions are not yet over . " disagreements on energy european diplomats said the polish government wanted a demand that moscow ratify the energy charter treaty - which sets the rules for international energy trade - included in the eu 's negotiating position .
moscow has signed the treaty but has not ratified it . " we want russia to ratify the energy treaty , " a polish spokesman confirmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel wants to clear up energy issues with russia france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the treaty 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has not ratified the entire document . speaking before the german council on foreign relations earlier this week , however , german chancellor merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market . russia may join wto meanwhile , russia 's economic development ministry confirmed on friday that moscow hoped for a deal with the united states next week on entry into the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a member of the wto both sides have agreed on all principal conditions for this agreement , " the ministry said in a statement . " both delegations are currently holding internal consultations in order to ensure the signing of a bilateral agreement on market access during the apec summit in hanoi " next week . earlier the us government announced it hoped to sign a wto accession deal with russia at the asia-pacific summit in vietnam . " we have an agreement in principle and are finalizing the details , " us trade representative susan schwab said in a statement . " this agreement will mark an important step in russia attaining membership in the wto , " she said . russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a part of the wto and it needs the support of the united states before it can accede to the 149-member club . the main outstanding question revolves around us meat imports to russia , but moscow has often complained that the deal was being held up by political issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for more debate , less quarrelling in the eu german chancellor angela merkel said that reforms in turkey , negotiations on kosovo 's future status and relations with russia will be among the most important foreign policy concerns during the german eu presidency .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon . after an extended tug-of-war , the german government voted thursday to ban tobacco advertising . this week 's decision ends tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines and the internet , as well as for sports that are broadcast on television .
since 1974 , tobacco advertising has been banned on radio and television .
it will continue to be allowed in some cases , such as in movie theaters and on billboards . while a large majority of parliament supported the advertising ban , the decision was delayed for more than a year .
publishers and advertisers had fought hard against the advertising ban and criticized thursday 's decision , according to the dpa . while the measure easily passed germany 's lower house of parliament , the free democrat party , a free-market liberal party , voted against the ban .
it patronizes consumers and forbids advertising for a legal substance , the fdp said . further smoking bans likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pubs might be excluded from smoking bans further smoking regulations are in the works .
a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-
the ruling coalition of the spd and christian democratic union are still negotiating possible exemptions and legal ramifications of the law , she said . decision angers industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers are included in the ban the new tobacco advertising ban could decrease the amount of tobacco-related taxes the government takes in as well as cut into advertising profits .
the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .

no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .
if the controversial coach does decide to come home , it could make for a very colorful second half of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne 's prince abdicates for new throne at bayern munich germany striker lukas " the prince " podolski ended months of speculation thursday by finally agreeing a four-year deal worth 2.5 million euros a year with bundesliga champions bayern munich .

dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .

what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- paper : german troops staged mock execution of afghan boy german troops have been accused of photographing a terrified young boy as a solider held a gun to his head in the latest allegations of misconduct to hit bundeswehr forces stationed in afghanistan .

dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .

" there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 10.11.2006 icc opens landmark hearing against alleged warlord großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas lubanga is currently the only suspect in the icc 's custody the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- opened a landmark hearing thursday against its first suspect , an alleged congolese warlord accused of forcibly recruiting children and turning them into trained killers . prosecutors told the court that they would present the " double face " of the accused , thomas lubanga , revealing the manipulative military commander who sought to hide behind a politician 's mask . " lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-

the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .

with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- eu report to criticize turkey over cyprus , pace of reforms the european commission dealt a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.11.2006 turkish government talks tough to avoid election defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish politicians worried eu could cost them the election the turkish government wants to avoid election defeat at all cost , even if it means snubbing eu demands .
despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- eu report to criticize turkey over cyprus , pace of reforms the european commission dealt a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .
" everything , at every level .
it was just extraordinary across the board .

" picasso withdrawn over ownership wrangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picasso 's famous painting was a last minute withdrawl as well as record-breaking prices and the allure of art appropriated during the third reich , the auction had a taste of the controversial when one of the star lots , picasso 's $ 50 million blue period portrait of angel fernandez do soto , was pulled by british composer sir andrew lloyd webber after an 11th-hour claim and litigation over its rightful title . lloyd webber decided not to sell the 1903 picasso which has been owned by the andrew lloyd webber art foundation since 1995 after julius schöps , a descendent of berlin banker paul von mendelssohn-bartholdy , alleged that his relative was forced to sell the work at well below its true value under nazi oppression in 1934 . a new york judge dismissed schöps ' court challenge on tuesday , but christie 's said further legal maneuvers had forced it to withdraw the portrait from the sale shortly before the auction . but auction officials said they were confident they could resolve the matter in " short order " and would be able to sell it on behalf of lloyd webber 's foundation as planned .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .

but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .

dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .

what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .

the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .

but when concerts , movie clips and soccer games are shown , touchy copyright questions come up . the german society for musical performing and mechanical reproduction rights -lrb- gema -rrb- has demanded that google either pay royalties for publishing copyrighted material on youtube or erase it . google , which bought the one-and-a-half year-old video portal in early october for $ 1.65 billion , has apparently agreed to gema 's stipulation .
" of course we will respect and protect copyrights , " said spokesman stefan keuchel . monitoring nearly impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can google meet copyright laws while maintaining the essence of youtube ?
however , since it is individual users put the videos online and not google , this is easier said than done .
some 70,000 new videos are uploaded by private users each day . currently there is no preliminary screening to prevent the upload of copyrighted videos . " we 're not going to wait for the negotiations .
we 've already made google aware of the copyright violations on youtube that affect our members , " a spokesperson from the music society told german daily newspaper handelsblatt this week . the music industry is now hoping to avoid a never-ending legal battle similar to the case with the music exchange portal napster . music industry not alone gema is the first major music industry association trying to settle copyright claims with youtube , but not the only party seeking legal action . both the german soccer league and the soccer club fc bayern munich have also announced that they will not overlook copyright violations on youtube . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fc bayern munich do n't want to let go of exclusive video rights to their games fc bayern munich markets their own games on the website fcb.tv and draws around 30,000 subscribers .
the soccer club 's chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said he sees pirated game clips as a violation of their " exclusive rights " to video broadcasting . the german soccer league has hired a private company called netresult to detect video recordings online that violate their copyright . google has not proved unresponsive to legal concerns .
last month nearly 30,000 files were deleted when a japanese publishing organization complained of copyright infringement on youtube . " youtube is a great thing " the biggest challenge , it seems , will be to find a balance between satisfying copyright laws and maintaining the essence of youtube 's - that video exchange is freely accessible to all . " youtube is a great thing , " stefan weikert , a manager at edel music told handelsblatt .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.11.2006 chaotic cologne calls for daum to save the day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a bird ?
is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon . after an extended tug-of-war , the german government voted thursday to ban tobacco advertising . this week 's decision ends tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines and the internet , as well as for sports that are broadcast on television .
since 1974 , tobacco advertising has been banned on radio and television .
it will continue to be allowed in some cases , such as in movie theaters and on billboards . while a large majority of parliament supported the advertising ban , the decision was delayed for more than a year .
publishers and advertisers had fought hard against the advertising ban and criticized thursday 's decision , according to the dpa . while the measure easily passed germany 's lower house of parliament , the free democrat party , a free-market liberal party , voted against the ban .
it patronizes consumers and forbids advertising for a legal substance , the fdp said . further smoking bans likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pubs might be excluded from smoking bans further smoking regulations are in the works .
a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-
the ruling coalition of the spd and christian democratic union are still negotiating possible exemptions and legal ramifications of the law , she said . decision angers industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers are included in the ban the new tobacco advertising ban could decrease the amount of tobacco-related taxes the government takes in as well as cut into advertising profits .
the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- paper : german troops staged mock execution of afghan boy german troops have been accused of photographing a terrified young boy as a solider held a gun to his head in the latest allegations of misconduct to hit bundeswehr forces stationed in afghanistan .

but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .

who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .

no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .
if the controversial coach does decide to come home , it could make for a very colorful second half of the season . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cologne 's prince abdicates for new throne at bayern munich germany striker lukas " the prince " podolski ended months of speculation thursday by finally agreeing a four-year deal worth 2.5 million euros a year with bundesliga champions bayern munich .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon . after an extended tug-of-war , the german government voted thursday to ban tobacco advertising . this week 's decision ends tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines and the internet , as well as for sports that are broadcast on television .
since 1974 , tobacco advertising has been banned on radio and television .
it will continue to be allowed in some cases , such as in movie theaters and on billboards . while a large majority of parliament supported the advertising ban , the decision was delayed for more than a year .
publishers and advertisers had fought hard against the advertising ban and criticized thursday 's decision , according to the dpa . while the measure easily passed germany 's lower house of parliament , the free democrat party , a free-market liberal party , voted against the ban .
it patronizes consumers and forbids advertising for a legal substance , the fdp said . further smoking bans likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pubs might be excluded from smoking bans further smoking regulations are in the works .
a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-
the ruling coalition of the spd and christian democratic union are still negotiating possible exemptions and legal ramifications of the law , she said . decision angers industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers are included in the ban the new tobacco advertising ban could decrease the amount of tobacco-related taxes the government takes in as well as cut into advertising profits .
the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

more anti-smoking legislation is on the horizon . after an extended tug-of-war , the german government voted thursday to ban tobacco advertising . this week 's decision ends tobacco advertising in newspapers , magazines and the internet , as well as for sports that are broadcast on television .
since 1974 , tobacco advertising has been banned on radio and television .
it will continue to be allowed in some cases , such as in movie theaters and on billboards . while a large majority of parliament supported the advertising ban , the decision was delayed for more than a year .
publishers and advertisers had fought hard against the advertising ban and criticized thursday 's decision , according to the dpa . while the measure easily passed germany 's lower house of parliament , the free democrat party , a free-market liberal party , voted against the ban .
it patronizes consumers and forbids advertising for a legal substance , the fdp said . further smoking bans likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pubs might be excluded from smoking bans further smoking regulations are in the works .
a law to ban smoking in public buildings , public transportation and places which food is served could happen early next year . consumer affairs minister gerd müller said the planned anti-smoking legislation was not meant as a blanket smoking prohibition , rather as a way to protect people against second-hand smoke .
the government will seek a " practical solution " for the 250,000 food-oriented businesses affected by a proposed smoking ban , müller said , citing the possibility of separate smoking areas .
taverns would be exempted from a smoking ban . while anti-smoking legislation is in the works , do n't expect to see it before the end of the year .
" that would be tight , " carola reimann told dpa .
but it likely will be on the parliament 's agenda early next year , said reimann , spokeswoman for health for the social democratic party -lrb- spd . -rrb-
the ruling coalition of the spd and christian democratic union are still negotiating possible exemptions and legal ramifications of the law , she said . decision angers industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers are included in the ban the new tobacco advertising ban could decrease the amount of tobacco-related taxes the government takes in as well as cut into advertising profits .
the last government , which included the spd and greens , challenged the eu 's ability to ban tobacco advertising .
but the european court of justice appears likely to dismiss that argument . advertisers and publishers generally condemned this week 's decision .
newspaper publishers said they do n't understand the german government 's decision and saw it as a restriction to their freedom to advertise . the publishing industry was especially distressed since the german government 's case in the european court , while not likely to pass , is still technically pending . the german association of magazine publishers -lrb- vdz -rrb- said the government capitulated with its " overly-hasty " decision , dpa reported .
the vote to ban tobacco advertising shows the increasing influence of the eu over national questions , the vdz said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin smoking ban hoped to set example for rest of germany berlin 's local government wants a ground-breaking ban on smoking in the city 's public buildings as well as all bars and restaurants , reviving debate on outlawing smoking across the country .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .

" and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .
" everything , at every level .
it was just extraordinary across the board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- paper : german troops staged mock execution of afghan boy german troops have been accused of photographing a terrified young boy as a solider held a gun to his head in the latest allegations of misconduct to hit bundeswehr forces stationed in afghanistan .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- german navy escorted warships headed for iraq the german government has admitted being indirectly involved in the iraq war by having its navy escort american and british warships .
on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .

the maximum number of troops was dropped from 2,800 to 1,800 .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists .

24 in helsinki . european commission spokeswoman on external affairs , emma udwin , acknowledged on friday " polish reserves " over the issue , but added that " the discussions are not yet over . " disagreements on energy european diplomats said the polish government wanted a demand that moscow ratify the energy charter treaty - which sets the rules for international energy trade - included in the eu 's negotiating position .
moscow has signed the treaty but has not ratified it . " we want russia to ratify the energy treaty , " a polish spokesman confirmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel wants to clear up energy issues with russia france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the treaty 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has not ratified the entire document . speaking before the german council on foreign relations earlier this week , however , german chancellor merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market . russia may join wto meanwhile , russia 's economic development ministry confirmed on friday that moscow hoped for a deal with the united states next week on entry into the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a member of the wto both sides have agreed on all principal conditions for this agreement , " the ministry said in a statement . " both delegations are currently holding internal consultations in order to ensure the signing of a bilateral agreement on market access during the apec summit in hanoi " next week . earlier the us government announced it hoped to sign a wto accession deal with russia at the asia-pacific summit in vietnam . " we have an agreement in principle and are finalizing the details , " us trade representative susan schwab said in a statement . " this agreement will mark an important step in russia attaining membership in the wto , " she said . russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a part of the wto and it needs the support of the united states before it can accede to the 149-member club . the main outstanding question revolves around us meat imports to russia , but moscow has often complained that the deal was being held up by political issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for more debate , less quarrelling in the eu german chancellor angela merkel said that reforms in turkey , negotiations on kosovo 's future status and relations with russia will be among the most important foreign policy concerns during the german eu presidency .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .
" everything , at every level .
it was just extraordinary across the board .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region . on numerous occasions , as the war in iraq got underway , the german navy provided escort protection for american and british warships , german news agency dpa reported . german involvement in the iraq war remains a thorny issue .
while the german government officially opposed the us-led invasion , the german military appears to have found other ways to support the iraq war effort .
besides escorting warships , german agents allegedly provided intelligence information as the war got underway . escort service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german navy provide support for the iraq war ? germany 's parliament voted friday to continue its military support of " operation enduring freedom , " as the us military has named its fight against terror . currently , several hundred german soldiers are deployed in afghanistan and on ships near the horn of africa .
the maximum number of troops was dropped from 2,800 to 1,800 .
germany only has a few hundred soldiers deployed , far fewer than either of the maximums . the german defense ministry conceded that on more than two dozen occasions the german navy escorted british and us warships and other military vessels through the straight between the red sea and gulf of aden .
the activity started even before the war officially started on march 20 , 2003 .
it continued during the first weeks after the war began .
after us president george w. bush officially declared the end of the iraq war in april , 2003 , data shows the navy continued escorting military ships , dpa said . the stated mission of the german navy during operation enduring freedom was to examine suspicious ships at the horn of africa in order to prevent possible weapons shipments .
approximately 300 soldiers are deployed on this mission . overstepping the mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escorting ships was not part of the german navy 's original mission escorting warships through the area was not covered by the german parliament 's mandate , said paul schäfer of the left party . " with these new revelations as a backdrop , the government must immediately terminate the bundeswehr mission at the horn of africa , " schäfer said . any other action would further support the occupying forces in iraq and the violence and chaos there , shäfer said .
the left party and the greens voted against friday 's decision to prolong the german military 's involvement in operation enduring freedom . the german navy has been told to monitor the trade and transport of goods which could be used to support terrorism .

dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .

what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .

the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .

24 in helsinki . european commission spokeswoman on external affairs , emma udwin , acknowledged on friday " polish reserves " over the issue , but added that " the discussions are not yet over . " disagreements on energy european diplomats said the polish government wanted a demand that moscow ratify the energy charter treaty - which sets the rules for international energy trade - included in the eu 's negotiating position .
moscow has signed the treaty but has not ratified it . " we want russia to ratify the energy treaty , " a polish spokesman confirmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel wants to clear up energy issues with russia france and germany , among others , argued at an eu summit in finland last month that the tactics be changed , and that the bloc attempt to include as many of the treaty 's main points as possible in the new partnership accord , even if russia has not ratified the entire document . speaking before the german council on foreign relations earlier this week , however , german chancellor merkel said that a new cooperation and partnership agreement with russia should have its energy chapter " formulated with clear basic rules . " " russia is at the moment not ready to ratify the transit protocol of the energy charter treaty , " merkel said .
" we would like to see that happen . " the energy charter treaty would give european companies wider access to russian gas and oil fields and to the russian energy market . russia may join wto meanwhile , russia 's economic development ministry confirmed on friday that moscow hoped for a deal with the united states next week on entry into the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a member of the wto both sides have agreed on all principal conditions for this agreement , " the ministry said in a statement .

" we have an agreement in principle and are finalizing the details , " us trade representative susan schwab said in a statement . " this agreement will mark an important step in russia attaining membership in the wto , " she said . russia is the only major world economy that is not yet a part of the wto and it needs the support of the united states before it can accede to the 149-member club . the main outstanding question revolves around us meat imports to russia , but moscow has often complained that the deal was being held up by political issues . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to push for more debate , less quarrelling in the eu german chancellor angela merkel said that reforms in turkey , negotiations on kosovo 's future status and relations with russia will be among the most important foreign policy concerns during the german eu presidency .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .

what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?

the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .

now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.11.2006 turkish government talks tough to avoid election defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish politicians worried eu could cost them the election the turkish government wants to avoid election defeat at all cost , even if it means snubbing eu demands .
despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- eu report to criticize turkey over cyprus , pace of reforms the european commission dealt a blow to turkey 's eu membership hopes with the publication of a key report that criticizes the pace of ankara 's reform and turkey 's stance on cyprus .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .
dr. hauschka 's adam notes that with four tons of rose petals needed to make just a kilo of rose oil - a key ingredient in its top-selling rose moisturizing lotion - the " amount of organic rose petals we can buy on the world market is limited . " and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .
-lrb- 08.11.2006 -rrb- germany hopeful of defusing looming crisis with turkey as positions over continuing accession talks with ankara harden , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he was confident a solution could be found to turkey 's dispute with cyprus by the end of the year .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .

provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .

" there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .

no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .
the scandal was felt so deeply in germany that when rudi völler resigned in the wake of germany 's euro 2004 failure , daum was n't even considered for the job that eventually went to jürgen klinsmann . now it appears , his old club cologne are preparing to offer the prodigal son a reason to return to the bundesliga and daum is said to be considering the offer .

is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .
their decision is expected late january . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court rejects civilian war damages claim a german federal court decided thursday that families of civilians killed in a 1999 nato air strike on a serbian town can not seek compensation from germany , affirming that civilians may not sue countries for war damages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.11.2006 chaotic cologne calls for daum to save the day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is it a bird ?
is it a plane ?
no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .

no , it 's super daum .
but can he save fc cologne ?
who do you turn to when your club is in chaos and you 've just fired your head coach ?
some would raise an eyebrow or two if you suggested a man tainted by a drugs and sex scandal .
but that 's what fc cologne is proposing . it seems desperate times lead to desperate measures . fc cologne were touted as one of the favorites for promotion from the second division of the bundesliga this season after being relegated at the end of the last campaign . but with eleven games gone , cologne are languishing in mid-table and a massive 12 points behind leaders karlsruhe .
the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .
after a unremarkable playing career with a number of amateur teams , daum began his coaching career with cologne 's youth team in 1981 before moving up to co-trainer of the first team in 1985 .
he went one step further the following year and took full control of team affairs , culminating in two runners-up spots in 1989 and 1990 . daum quits on brink of greatness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daum quit cologne to bring the title to rivals stuttgart just when it seemed that daum was going to push cologne to their first title since 1978 , he was lured away by vfb stuttgart leaving cologne to begin a sorry descent down the league which lasted for most of the 1990 's .
no one would have blamed the fans for calling daum a judas at that point , especially when two years later he led stuttgart to the bundesliga title which cologne had been so close to capturing under his reign . but his long association with cologne and his achievements at all levels with the club have kept him firmly held in many a heart .
daum 's return to cologne as a possible savior would give both club and coach a chance to renew their estranged love affair while the supporters would hope that daum 's magic touch in coaching would return cologne to the top flight . no one can doubt daum 's skill or ignore his record .
since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .
daum was poised to take on his country 's hopes of a revival and lead germany to world cup success in 2002 . this is where daum 's standing in most corners of german soccer , cologne included to some degree , fell dramatically .
just as daum was all set to take germany on the road to world cup qualification , he became embroiled in a very juicy and public drugs and sex scandal . accused of massive cocaine abuse and wild parties with prostitutes , daum was dropped from the national team 's plans like a hot potato .
he was still coach at leverkusen at the time but soon found himself out of work and out of the country as the club fired him and he fled to the united states while proclaiming his innocence . sex and drugs scandal tarnishes image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once seen as a savior , daum became a pariah in what would become known as the famous daum hair test , a renowned and internationally recognized laboratory at the university of cologne carried out tests on a hair from the disgraced coach 's head and found substantial traces of cocaine residue in the cells .
police then raided daum 's home and office at leverkusen in an investigation into his alleged drug use . daum maintained that the test had been manipulated and that he had been a victim of a conspiracy .
the outspoken coach had made many enemies in his time in the german game and had been involved in an ugly and very public feud with the hierarchy at rival club bayern munich .
his critics described his assertion he 'd been set-up as evidence of the paranoid effects of cocaine abuse . the affair signaled the start of daum 's exile from germany and his successful period of coaching success in turkey .

the team 's abject performance in the 1-0 home defeat to aue on wednesday was the last straw for sporting director michael meier who waited just 24 hours to terminate the contract of coach hanspeter latour . the removal of latour , in charge at the rheinenergie stadion for just over ten months , smacked of desperation and added to the feeling that events at cologne were swiftly moving beyond everyone 's control . cologne all at sea as promotion hopes fade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latour heads for the door cologne 's dreams of a swift return to the top flight now seemingly lay in tatters and the rudderless club faces a potentially tricky encounter away at freiburg on sunday with goalkeeping coach holger gehrke in charge until a successor is named .
and not just any old successor but a messiah , a superhero coach who can rescue one of the modern bundesliga 's proudest and oldest clubs . this is where the story starts to get interesting .
the name at the top of cologne 's wish-list for the new head coach is none other than christoph daum .
while giving the job to daum could not be considered a desperate measure given his success in the game , it would be a controversial appointment ; daum is hardly the wholesome clark kent / superman type . if daum takes up the challenge it would herald the return to german soccer of a prodigal son once considered a candidate for national savior . daum is held in surprising reverence by the cologne fans .

since leaving cologne in 1990 and winning the title with stuttgart in 1992 , daum has taken bayer leverkusen to three runners-up spots , won three turkish league titles -lrb- one with besiktas and two with fenerbahce -rrb- and managed to find time in between to win the austrian title with vienna . impressive record leads to top job offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when his country called , daum was found wanting in fact , his curriculum vitae was considered glittering enough for him to be touted as the successor to erich ribbeck as german national coach after ribbeck resigned in the wake of germany 's dismal euro 2000 performance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 10.11.2006 turkish government talks tough to avoid election defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish politicians worried eu could cost them the election the turkish government wants to avoid election defeat at all cost , even if it means snubbing eu demands .
despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .

" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- paper : german troops staged mock execution of afghan boy german troops have been accused of photographing a terrified young boy as a solider held a gun to his head in the latest allegations of misconduct to hit bundeswehr forces stationed in afghanistan .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- german navy escorted warships headed for iraq the german government has admitted being indirectly involved in the iraq war by having its navy escort american and british warships .
on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region .

despite tough talk from both sides , negotiations over turkey 's eu accession are unlikely to be scrapped . the eu and turkey seem at an impasse .
on wednesday , the european commission released a report demanding turkey open its ports and airports to cyprus by mid-december if they want to keep accession talks going .
turkey hit back , saying its ports will stay off-limits to cyprus until the eu keeps its promise to recognize the breakaway turkish republic of northern cyprus . this hard-line stance should n't be viewed as turkey rejecting the eu , suat kiniklioglu , director of the german marshall fund 's ankara office , told afp .
rather , it ’ s a sign of the political reality in ankara .
with presidential elections next spring and the legislative elections the following fall , the ruling justice and development party does n't want to look like pushovers , kiniklioglu said . " in the current tense political atmosphere in turkey , it is impossible for ankara to make any concession on cyprus in an election year , unless the eu makes one first , " he said .
" otherwise , it would be political suicide . " cyprus continues to rankle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus remains a tricky issue for turkey 's eu membership bid turkey 's stance towards cyprus is fundamental to its foreign policy .
voters would likely view anything appearing to be reconciliation as " selling off " the turkish cypriots , analysts believe .
in turkey , public support for the eu is also dwindling , making it a hard sell politically . on one of istanbul 's main shopping streets , there appeared to be universal anger against brussels as news of the critical eu report spread . " really , we do n't need europe .
they are making politics about cyprus , about genocide of armenians , about kurdish men , " teacher mustafa bagci told dw-radio . a recent survey conducted by international strategic studies institute -lrb- usak -rrb- found that 81 percent of the turkish public feels the eu 's treatment of turkey is " insincere and unjust . "
a full 70 percent felt turkey should suspend membership talks if the eu does n't change its stance on cyprus , afp reported . eu talks unlikely to end bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu 's olli rehn had tough words for turkey this week " this is likely to be the last opportunity to make real serious progress for some years to come on the issue of cyprus , " eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn told dw-radio .
" the commission will make relevant recommendations ahead of the european council in december , if turkey has not fulfilled its obligations . " yet despite the tough talk on both sides , most analysts see no risk of turkey 's eu membership talks being suspended , even if deadlock remains on the cyprus issue . yet there could be a quiet period where , while talks are n't officially suspended , there is also no progress made , kiniklioglu told afp . " there will be a lull in which the two sides will try to gain time , " kinklioglu predicted .
" after the elections , the new government will take up the issue with new blood . " there 's concern that germany , which takes over the eu presidency after finland , will put turkish membership in a deep freeze , making talks even more difficult to revive and keep on track . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to criticize turkey but will keep door open turkey will likely be allowed to continue the accession process after a key eu report is published .
but the bloc is also expected to take aim at what it sees as insufficient reform in a number of areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .
the defense minister has now pledged that that should be different in the future . so far , it 's been only words , but the long overdue change of course must now be implemented in deed .
special forces will in the future carry the main load of anti-terror operations , but this work of the secretive elite troops must be subject to parliamentary scrutiny .
members of the parliament could then allow themselves to judge how successful germany 's participation in the war on terror really is . andreas noll -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy urges deeper nato involvement in afghanistan the un representative in afghanistan tom koenigs , warned that nato and especially german forces must step up efforts to keep the strife-wracked country from sinking into chaos .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- paper : german troops staged mock execution of afghan boy german troops have been accused of photographing a terrified young boy as a solider held a gun to his head in the latest allegations of misconduct to hit bundeswehr forces stationed in afghanistan .
-lrb- 06.11.2006 -rrb- germany starts rethinking its foreign deployments german soldiers are engaged in eleven foreign missions .
but after a scandal with soldiers in afghanistan and fears that the military is overstretched , some want a reduction in the numbers of troops being sent abroad .
-lrb- 31.10.2006 -rrb- german navy escorted warships headed for iraq the german government has admitted being indirectly involved in the iraq war by having its navy escort american and british warships .
on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .

on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region . on numerous occasions , as the war in iraq got underway , the german navy provided escort protection for american and british warships , german news agency dpa reported . german involvement in the iraq war remains a thorny issue .
while the german government officially opposed the us-led invasion , the german military appears to have found other ways to support the iraq war effort .
besides escorting warships , german agents allegedly provided intelligence information as the war got underway . escort service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german navy provide support for the iraq war ? germany 's parliament voted friday to continue its military support of " operation enduring freedom , " as the us military has named its fight against terror . currently , several hundred german soldiers are deployed in afghanistan and on ships near the horn of africa .
the maximum number of troops was dropped from 2,800 to 1,800 .
germany only has a few hundred soldiers deployed , far fewer than either of the maximums . the german defense ministry conceded that on more than two dozen occasions the german navy escorted british and us warships and other military vessels through the straight between the red sea and gulf of aden .
the activity started even before the war officially started on march 20 , 2003 .
it continued during the first weeks after the war began .
after us president george w. bush officially declared the end of the iraq war in april , 2003 , data shows the navy continued escorting military ships , dpa said . the stated mission of the german navy during operation enduring freedom was to examine suspicious ships at the horn of africa in order to prevent possible weapons shipments .
approximately 300 soldiers are deployed on this mission . overstepping the mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escorting ships was not part of the german navy 's original mission escorting warships through the area was not covered by the german parliament 's mandate , said paul schäfer of the left party . " with these new revelations as a backdrop , the government must immediately terminate the bundeswehr mission at the horn of africa , " schäfer said . any other action would further support the occupying forces in iraq and the violence and chaos there , shäfer said .
the left party and the greens voted against friday 's decision to prolong the german military 's involvement in operation enduring freedom . the german navy has been told to monitor the trade and transport of goods which could be used to support terrorism .

" my family and i are delighted to see these treasured paintings find new homes , " she said in a statement after the sale in which she called the restitution " a landmark case . "
altmann added that she hoped the new owners would " build on the tradition of appreciation " her aunt and uncle had maintained . christie 's president marc porter said the staggering prices paid for the klimts showed how important the restitution issue was in the art world .
often looted works like those on show at christies are returned in pristine condition and generate huge demand due their previous unavailability on the open market .
many have hung in museums and galleries since the 1940s , porter added . the sale of the klimts was evidence that " putting reasonable estimates on works that are fresh to the market is just paying off in unimaginable ways , " porter told reporters . kirchner 's " berlin street scene " , another nazi-looted work restituted to the rightful heirs , rocketed to a price of $ 38.1 million , making it the sale 's fourth-highest priced work and contributed to the auction 's billing as the biggest in history . " the results were completely phenomenal , and beyond our wildest expectations , " said christopher burge , christie 's honorary chairman and the sale 's auctioneer .
" everything , at every level .
it was just extraordinary across the board .
i 've never seen a sale like this . " picasso withdrawn over ownership wrangle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picasso 's famous painting was a last minute withdrawl as well as record-breaking prices and the allure of art appropriated during the third reich , the auction had a taste of the controversial when one of the star lots , picasso 's $ 50 million blue period portrait of angel fernandez do soto , was pulled by british composer sir andrew lloyd webber after an 11th-hour claim and litigation over its rightful title . lloyd webber decided not to sell the 1903 picasso which has been owned by the andrew lloyd webber art foundation since 1995 after julius schöps , a descendent of berlin banker paul von mendelssohn-bartholdy , alleged that his relative was forced to sell the work at well below its true value under nazi oppression in 1934 . a new york judge dismissed schöps ' court challenge on tuesday , but christie 's said further legal maneuvers had forced it to withdraw the portrait from the sale shortly before the auction . but auction officials said they were confident they could resolve the matter in " short order " and would be able to sell it on behalf of lloyd webber 's foundation as planned .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .
dr. hauschka 's adam notes that with four tons of rose petals needed to make just a kilo of rose oil - a key ingredient in its top-selling rose moisturizing lotion - the " amount of organic rose petals we can buy on the world market is limited . " and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .

on friday , germany 's parliament voted to continue its navy presence in the region . on numerous occasions , as the war in iraq got underway , the german navy provided escort protection for american and british warships , german news agency dpa reported . german involvement in the iraq war remains a thorny issue .
while the german government officially opposed the us-led invasion , the german military appears to have found other ways to support the iraq war effort .
besides escorting warships , german agents allegedly provided intelligence information as the war got underway . escort service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did the german navy provide support for the iraq war ? germany 's parliament voted friday to continue its military support of " operation enduring freedom , " as the us military has named its fight against terror . currently , several hundred german soldiers are deployed in afghanistan and on ships near the horn of africa .
the maximum number of troops was dropped from 2,800 to 1,800 .
germany only has a few hundred soldiers deployed , far fewer than either of the maximums . the german defense ministry conceded that on more than two dozen occasions the german navy escorted british and us warships and other military vessels through the straight between the red sea and gulf of aden .
the activity started even before the war officially started on march 20 , 2003 .
it continued during the first weeks after the war began .
after us president george w. bush officially declared the end of the iraq war in april , 2003 , data shows the navy continued escorting military ships , dpa said . the stated mission of the german navy during operation enduring freedom was to examine suspicious ships at the horn of africa in order to prevent possible weapons shipments .
approximately 300 soldiers are deployed on this mission . overstepping the mandate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : escorting ships was not part of the german navy 's original mission escorting warships through the area was not covered by the german parliament 's mandate , said paul schäfer of the left party . " with these new revelations as a backdrop , the government must immediately terminate the bundeswehr mission at the horn of africa , " schäfer said . any other action would further support the occupying forces in iraq and the violence and chaos there , shäfer said .
the left party and the greens voted against friday 's decision to prolong the german military 's involvement in operation enduring freedom . the german navy has been told to monitor the trade and transport of goods which could be used to support terrorism .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .
back then , products by dr. hauschka or its competitors , like weleda and lavera , " were sitting on the shelf in the health-food store , right next to the potatotes , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : regular beauty products are stagnant while natural products grow but those days are long gone .
now , the market is aimed at the " lohas , " according to adam : young , moneyed , often urban people who are known to follow " lifestyles of health and sustainability . "
in recent years , dr. hauschka products have benefited from the kind of spontaneous hollywood endorsements -lrb- julia roberts , jennifer aniston , kylie minogue , -rrb- word-of-mouth and customer loyalty that most companies can only dream of . thorough germans ? emma moore , beauty editor at the lifestyle magazine wallpaper , agreed that while there is " loads of confusion about natural and organic , " the new products are generally meant to appeal to people who are " attracted to using high quality , natural products ; who like that bit of pureness .
it 's the same people who buy organic vegetables , and who can afford to buy into that organic lifestyle . " given the market 's potential , more and more players are jumping on the " natural " and " organic " bandwagon .
some of these , like french company doux me , are winning younger clients by stressing nature , but still giving their products a hip design - unlike some of the older product lines , moore said . still , german companies may have the advantage of reputation .
" you could imagine that in germany , once they pursue the natural product , they are going to be very stringent about it , " moore said .
" i associate that with germany - taking it philosophically one step further . " ingredients in demand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker makes rose oil extract for dr. hauschka products while the market share for natural products is on the rise , nature itself has put a cap on growth for some companies .
dr. hauschka 's adam notes that with four tons of rose petals needed to make just a kilo of rose oil - a key ingredient in its top-selling rose moisturizing lotion - the " amount of organic rose petals we can buy on the world market is limited . " and just pure , a southern german company that produces natural cosmetics primarily for sale in exclusive spas , does all its production according to anthroposophic theories based on the phases of the moon . this means that certain products can only be mixed , or certain plants harvested , when the moon is new or waxing . says company founder gabriela just , " sometimes we only have a couple of days for production .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .

" lubanga made children train to kill , lubanga made them kill and lubanga let the children die ... in hostilities , " prosecution lawyer ekkehard withopf said in his opening statement . lubanga stands charged with abducting children and forcing them to participate in attacks by the armed wing of his union of congolese patriots -lrb- upc -rrb- during wars that ravaged the democratic republic of congo . thursday 's hearing marked the first time prosecution lawyers have presented evidence in a case before judges at the icc - the world 's first permanent tribunal set up with the goal of helping " end impunity and the gross violations of international humanitarian law " in the area of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide . a question of jurisdiction putting the tribunal 's noble aim into practice has proved difficult .
although the court was created in 1998 with the signing of the rome statute , it formally came into being only four years later , after the 60th country had both signed up to and then ratified the treaty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : george w. bush is not a supporter of the icc currently 102 countries have done so , but there are key omissions from the list , including the united states and russia , which have both signed but not ratified the relevant treaty . the administration of us president george w bush has always been skeptical of the icc and has backed away from the decision by his predecessor , bill clinton , to sign the treaty , citing fears that the court could be manipulated into unfairly prosecuting us citizens for political reasons . countries like china , india and indonesia are not signatories .
israel has withdrawn its initial support , and jordan is the only arab signatory .
the european union , on the other hand , has been an active supporter of the icc .
it adopted a common position on the icc in 2001 . the icc differs from un tribunals like those for the former yugoslavia and rwanda in being a permanent court set up in the hague .
it has to rely on national authorities to find and hand over those accused of serious crimes in situations where often the remit of the national authorities does not run , such as under conditions of civil war . a war criminal or a peace lover ? at the start of the thursday hearing , lubanga , wearing bright blue traditional african dress , introduced himself as the former upc president .
provisionally charged with three counts of war crimes , he has denied all accusations against him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hearing is meant to determine whether the evidence against lubanga is strong enough to merit a full trial at a press conference on wednesday , lubanga 's lawyer jean flamme cast his client as a peace-loving politician - an image hotly disputed by prosecutors . the hearing also marked the first opportunity for the victims of lubanga 's alleged crimes to address an international court . " we hope that the presence of the victims will remind the participants that this hearing is not an intellectual exercise between prosecutor and defense , but that the destruction of thousands of young lives will be at the centre of the discussions , " belgian lawyer luc walleyn , representing three congolese families , told the court . he stressed that the victims still suffered daily from what has happened to them . " i have nightmares .
when i think of some of the things we did i wake up and my ears and my eyes hurt .
i hear noises , aircraft and i think other people can hear too and i ask them , but it 's just me , " walleyn quoted one of his clients , now barely 15 years old , telling psychologists . " we represent children whose souls will not rest until justice is done , " the lawyer said . human rights abuses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 60,000 lives were lost in the inter-ethnic fightings in drc lubanga , 45 , and his militia have been named in connection with a long series of human rights abuses in the north-eastern drc region of ituri where inter-ethnic fighting over gold mines and other resources has claimed more than 60,000 lives since 1999 , according to humanitarian groups . " the practice of ... using children in warfare represents one of the most brutal and morally troubling crimes against the most vulnerable groups in times of war : children , " deputy prosecutor fatou bensouda said . the drc is among nations with the largest number of child soldiers in the world , the prosecution said .
at the height of the war as many as 30,000 children were associated with armed groups . the confirmation hearing is set to run through november 28 , after which the judges must determine whether lubanga will become the first person to stand trial before the icc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.11.2006 opinion : war on terror needs transparency and control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government extended its commitment to the anti-terror operation enduring freedom on friday .
dw 's andreas noll says that was a good decision , but that the german mandate needs better parliamentary scrutiny . the military has a sense for symbolics : that is why the occasionally dirty military war against international terrorism has been signed off under the harmless name of operation enduring freedom .
five years after the begin of this robust military action , however , its success is anything but obvious .
afghanistan is a case in point : even though the restrengthened taliban are threatening freedom there , the enduring freedom units have partially passed the fight against terror onto the un-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- , which was actually meant to secure the rebuilding of the country . the german bundeswehr has been part of operation enduring freedom from the very beginning - in afghanistan with special forces , and in the horn of africa as part of maritime monitoring operations .
not much is known about the success in the horn of africa , but there are indications that this not very robust mission is more symbolical rather than a great strike against international terrorism . despite these limitations , the german government did good to extend german participation in the multinational operation - if for no other reason than for the sake of solidarity , which is important in an alliance .
at the same time , however , german parliamentarians failed to take stock of the military reaction to sept .
11 .
what is it that soldiers can actually achieve in the fight against terrorism and what not ?
five years later , we should have some answers . the lack of this type of debate also has to do with germany 's lack of consistence .
despite all the open critique of a failed us policy , german troops have also been part of an anti-terror war whose victims include not only the taliban but also innocent civilians .
that was never a secret , but it is not exactly something that politicians wanted to say to the people .
and the people did n't exactly want to know it either .
they preferred to stick with the picture of a smiling aid worker in uniform and ranted openly about the allies ' methods . but the case of murat kurnaz shattered that picture .
the german-born turk from bremen feels that he has been abused by members of the german elite commandos -lrb- ksk -rrb- .
bundeswehr soldiers allegedly pulled him by his hair and slammed his head into the ground .
opposition parties in germany used that as a reason to criticize sharply the minister of defense , because franz-josef jung and his predecessors were informing the parliament only vaguely about the enduing freedom activities in afghanistan .
the parliament had to speculate about injuries and casualties , supposedly not to endanger the secret anti-terror operations .

organic is booming , and not just when it comes to food .
the european market for super-pure , all-natural cosmetics is seeing double-digit growth - with some german firms leading the trend . as health food supermarkets sprout up around europe like organically-fertilized mushrooms , a new consumer trend is following in their wake .
increasingly , people who are extra careful about what they put in their bodies are paying strict attention to what they put on their bodies , as well . while regular cosmetic sales have been flat , sales of natural and organic cosmetics have seen double-digit growth increases in recent years , according to the uk-based consumer research group organics monitor .
revenues are expected to surpass the 1 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- mark for the first time this year , the group said . germany and france have the fastest rates of growth in europe , but germany - keeping up with its reputation as a forerunner in all things " green " - has the highest market share for natural cosmetics , at 4 percent compared to 2 percent market share in the rest of europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk 's " body shop " rides the line between natural and ethical antal adam is the spokesman for germany 's leading organic cosmetics seller , dr. hauschka .
-lrb- switzerland 's weleda is the overall european market leader . -rrb-
he says its parent company , wala heilmittel gmbh , has been experiencing " pleasant two-digit sales growth " for years - a fact he attributes to a general boom in organics and to the stringent purity of his company 's own products . setting the purity bar one problem the budding industry faces is disagreement over what , exactly , constitutes " natural " cosmetics .
what percentage of the plant ingredients must be organic ?
are certain synthetics allowed ?
the problem is magnified by the fact that , unlike health foods , cosmetics do not have a regulating body . this means each company decides where to set the purity bar - and leaves a good deal of responsibility on the back of the consumer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and makeup - a historic team according to adam , dr. hauschka products are successful because they meet such strict standards .
not only are the ingredients as close to 100 percent organic as possible – they are often grown in accordance with biodynamic principles , in the company 's own organic gardens - but no synthetics are allowed . in addition , the company is structured as a non-profit .
its business model is " based on the notion that all economic activities should go to people who are involved in the process - the workers and customers , " adam said . enter the ' lohas ' the natural skin care market started with small , " niche " companies that catered either to people with dermatological problems or die-hard ' eco ' types who " wore wool socks and sandals , " adam said .

the remaining two seats are held by independent senators who say they will vote with the democrats , giving the party a 51-49 majority .

to massive cheers from gathered supporters , mr webb held up a pair of boots worn by his son , who is currently serving in iraq .
in his speech , mr allen said he did not want to cause " more rancour " by seeking a recount which he did not think would alter the outcome .

here are his daily reports on life with the troops , with the most recent one at the top .
friday 10 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- small stones and fine sand were whipped up into our faces as the chinook transporter helicopter landed in the desert to whisk us back to camp bastion .
the end of the road for fred , peter and alastair our embedded trip with the royal marine commandos in southern helmand had come to an end and we loaded up our equipment alongside tyres , a large gun that was being replaced and a few people heading back like us .
the final night had seen the marine commandos use two more rockets to kill , they say , a further three taleban fighters in a bunker they had been monitoring for a number of days .
we accompanied the afghan national army on a foot patrol around a village and it was interesting to see the british mentoring and training team 's idea of meeting people to gather intelligence rubbing off .
as i said on thursday , it 's the way forward to train up the army and police , but i remain to be convinced as to whether the language and cultural barrier is just too great to see major progress in the next few years .
we left them moving into another village where they came under fire - it 's still a dangerous place .
over the past few days our team of fred scott -lrb- cameraman -rrb- , peter emmerson -lrb- producer -rrb- and i have had a unique insight into how the front-line forces operate .
we were very impressed by the soldiers ' professionalism , commitment and morale - they welcomed and protected us in a very dangerous environment .
winning hearts and minds they are a specialist group of commandos , at the sharp end of the continuing war against the taleban - and incidentally monday will mark five years since the coalition forced the taleban out of kabul .
they have the military prowess and the superior equipment - be it night-vision , heat-sensing goggles , the backup of artillery and air power and the tactical awareness .
but the taleban have the best defensive positions , know the terrain , and by luring the british forces to attack them , are forcing the marines to drop bombs on and around villages .
it 's a real stalemate , and it really has been going nowhere .
the patrol commander would say they have taken the tactical advantage , by moving into the town , but yet remaining mobile , but the majority of people are still living in surrounding villages to avoid the fighting .
it 's difficult to chase hearts and minds when they are running from you .
the war continues , and there 's still no convincing proof the overall policy of security first , and then development and better governance hot on its heels , will make a difference .
winning people over is still the aim , but it 's not as easy as it may have seemed in the military war gaming .
but , on a lighter note , i have a quiz to bring this blog to an end .
the royal marine commandos have a language all of their own - we had to pick it up as we went along .
see how you would do .

" 8 - " that 's great / brilliant / excellent " thursday 9 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- i spent some time with one of the british teams helping to mentor the afghan national army , the future of afghanistan , and the exit strategy for the nato and us forces .
but it 's an indication of just how long the whole process will take when you see the newly trained soldiers working alongside the royal marine commandos .
afghan national police and their vehicle of choice - a pick-up truck the transport of choice for the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- is a twin-cab pickup truck - there 's enough room to cram an extraordinary number onto the back - all proudly armed with rocket propelled grenades , and with belts of ammunition wrapped around their chests .
the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
people moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .
maintaining good communications is vital the situation in this town is something of a stalemate , with the taleban six or seven hundred metres away not firing , nor even popping out to take a look - perhaps after last night 's clash .
a shot has just been fired - it happens from time to time - punctuating the evening , but neither side at the moment is gaining any ground - and that situation is playing into the hands of the taleban as each clash destroys buildings or farmland and nibbles away at the hearts and minds the british are so keen to win .
a meeting took place between the elders of the town and a high-level british officer - brokered by the troop commander over the past few days .
they drove out into the desert on the back of a tractor for a " shura " or meeting - grey and white bearded men crushed into the back .
unfolding themselves from the trailer they sat in a circle on red blankets with cups of tea in plastic cups provided by their british hosts .
the first meeting came about after they had spent 10 hours wandering the desert looking for the british patrol .
their main complaint was that every time the british came near villages the taleban fired on them and then the return fire from the marines - artillery , aircraft and heavy weapons , as i have described , was causing people to flee and destroying homes - putting civilians very much in the line of fire .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is spending time with troops they wanted the taleban out , but they did n't want the daily skirmishes to go on , they said - it was bad for the people .
it 's hoped this might be the first step towards some form of ceasefire - similar perhaps to the deal done in musa qala , which is still holding , despite scepticism that it 's not the way forward .
but the british forces are keen to stress it needs to be an afghan solution - it is something politically that must be done by the people themselves .
everyone here agrees that the nato mission , to bring peace and development to afghanistan and win over the people for the democratic government , will not succeed through fighting alone - it will have to be a political solution .
indeed , the indication from the elders here was that fighting was doing more harm than good .
even the nato force commander , lt gen david richards , has warned the people could back the taleban unless change comes quickly .
it 's a very difficult situation , and one that needs close attention to afghan culture and traditions - it 's also a very slow process - a reminder perhaps of how long it is going to take to make a long and lasting difference in afghanistan .
tuesday 7 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- the sun is just coming up over the horizon and the ration-pack hot chocolate is slowly heating the bbc team up after the most dangerous night yet with the front line 3 commando force in helmand .
they had a slow day sitting it out in the desert waiting for a spare part for one of the vehicles and meeting up with the british team mentoring the afghan national army .
the afghan national army have been keeping the taleban at bay we will be spending a few days with them , so it was the first chance to see some of the afghan soldiers who will take over responsibility for security in the country when international forces eventually leave .
it was as we bedded down for the night that the call came to stand by and be ready to move at a moment 's notice .
the town which the marine commandos have been moving in and around , but which i 've been asked not to name here for security reasons , is pretty much under the control of the taleban , apart from the small collection of buildings and compounds which make up the district centre .
the afghan national police -lrb- anp -rrb- have been fighting off nightly attacks on a number of fronts , but felt they needed help and called for british reinforcements .
the most dangerous part of the trip was the route in , not knowing if another ambush would be waiting - as it had been when the patrol left the town a few days ago .
it was like daylight driving towards the town , the moon still full , and i felt a mixture of excitement and fear about the operation .
a pistol was left near us " in case things go wrong " - we had been shown how to use one , just as a last resort , the day before .
extra mortar bombs were loaded in the vehicle and as we began the dash into the town you could see bullets flying across from right to left far in front of us .
but surprisingly it was quiet - we reached the checkpoints and snipers took up positions , and a rocket was made ready .
the afghan police who were manning the sandbagged positions excitedly pointed six or seven hundred metres away in different directions saying " taleban " and then trying to explain to us in sign language how they had held them off .
on top of one of the mud buildings used as a firing position there were bullet cases scattered about the rickety roof - afghan police gave out tea .
then there was movement out in no-man 's land , picked up by night-vision and heat-sensitive binoculars - the marines said they saw through the sights men carrying weapons , and that had been confirmed from another viewing point .
the snipers fired two shots and illuminating shells exploded above , lighting up the town .
then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
the route into the town was the most dangerous part of the trip i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
afghan soldiers will eventually take over security the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .
sunday 5 november 0600 -lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- the front line team of 3 commando brigade managed to stay out of trouble today in the helmand desert , but picked up quite a lot of information from local people .
reflecting on a lucky escape ...
there was a report back from the town where the ambush had taken place yesterday - and if believable it was good news for the british forces .
during the battle a number of artillery shells were fired , and one had , according to intelligence , hit a group of withdrawing taleban fighters .
reports like this often come in - for example after wednesday 's clash they heard more than 30 insurgents had been injured or killed - but it 's almost impossible to verify , or to know if civilians were among the casualties .
we saw first hand how a bombing raid was stopped at the last minute to avoid " collateral damage , " but the dropping of a 2000lb bomb in part of a village had been only seconds away .
some information comes from funerals and eye witnesses , but there 's no way of telling what could be the impact of the bombing and the shelling .
military discipline is crucial for living and coping in the desert and the marines on the patrol are the first to admit how difficult it is to tell civilians from taleban fighters when they are not actually shooting at them .
some of those the patrol came across today complained that the fighting was doing more harm than good to the village and its residents , and more should be done to stop the fighting .
but with the taleban very much in control of the town it 's not easy - the afghan security forces there were bombarded heavily after dark .
on the drive today , we also managed to get a good look at the landscape along the helmand river valley which winds right through the province .
the marines picked up some pleasing news from the locals most people live along the narrow band of water-fed greenery which rears out of mile after mile of barren desert .
many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .
saturday 4 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- there was a quiet start to another day in the desert , but the afternoon brought another fire-fight , the second in two days and this one even closer than the first .
the bbc team has frequently come under fire with british troops the royal marines 3 commando brigade are pushing out into southern helmand province , trying to get a feel for the taleban - how much of a threat they are and in which areas , and our three-man crew is with them .
there were reports of thousands of refugees being forced out of the towns where fighting has been the most intense , but today the intelligence proved to be wrong .
the patrol came across people living in tents outside the town with families and animals in tow , but with the help of a translator , the troop commander discovered they were nomadic kuchis and knew little about the taleban .
the patrol medic is david blades , 26 , and his job is n't just to help his own colleagues , but assist the local people however he can .
so after chatting about the fighting , it was down to the injured foot and the nasty case of heartburn - the latter was easy , but the former was impossible to cure - the patient had glass in his foot , but it had been there so long the skin had healed up and needed an operation .
go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .
giving some medicine at least makes them feel better , " he told me .
this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
homes in helmand province evoke another age at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
the nomadic kuchi know little about the taleban it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
medic david blades does what he can to help they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .
a final rocket from the taleban landed short and a major engagement with their enemy came to an end .
" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
the marines hit back at a suspect position using a 1,00lb bomb in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
q & a : uk troops it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .
surrounding us are pairs of highly armed if scantily-armoured patrol vehicles , with a .50 calibre machine gun on each pointing out from our small corral .
each vehicle will be manned all night long .
we are a few kilometres from a town that is still largely under the control of the taleban .
the force is tasked with roaming the desert for weeks on end , feeding back information to headquarters and fighting back if attacked .
the marines drove through the town to show their presence .
they expected to come under fire , but it remained quiet .
there were a few children playing , a few farmers ploughing their dusty fields and a few people driving camels to their own corral , the huge beasts hopping , their front feet bound together to stop them running away .
we headed back into the desert and grabbed our rations just before sunset - it was too late to light the small solid fuel stoves and heat up the meal in a bag - as we had to be in place well out of sight or sound of the town before it got dark .
troops do get down time , but there are few diversions in the desert but after a day being battered about in the back of a small patrol vehicle , open to the beating desert sun , any food hot or cold was welcome , as was the chocolate .
the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .
they met up with the artillery gunners who provide support for the force as it stays constantly on the move , never staying overnight in the same place twice and always prepared to call for artillery support and for air power if needed .
the force we are with is a specialist unit used to these arduous conditions - and to the risk of ambush and attack .
this could prove to be a fascinating week .

the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
people moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .
maintaining good communications is vital the situation in this town is something of a stalemate , with the taleban six or seven hundred metres away not firing , nor even popping out to take a look - perhaps after last night 's clash .
a shot has just been fired - it happens from time to time - punctuating the evening , but neither side at the moment is gaining any ground - and that situation is playing into the hands of the taleban as each clash destroys buildings or farmland and nibbles away at the hearts and minds the british are so keen to win .
a meeting took place between the elders of the town and a high-level british officer - brokered by the troop commander over the past few days .
they drove out into the desert on the back of a tractor for a " shura " or meeting - grey and white bearded men crushed into the back .
unfolding themselves from the trailer they sat in a circle on red blankets with cups of tea in plastic cups provided by their british hosts .
the first meeting came about after they had spent 10 hours wandering the desert looking for the british patrol .
their main complaint was that every time the british came near villages the taleban fired on them and then the return fire from the marines - artillery , aircraft and heavy weapons , as i have described , was causing people to flee and destroying homes - putting civilians very much in the line of fire .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is spending time with troops they wanted the taleban out , but they did n't want the daily skirmishes to go on , they said - it was bad for the people .
it 's hoped this might be the first step towards some form of ceasefire - similar perhaps to the deal done in musa qala , which is still holding , despite scepticism that it 's not the way forward .
but the british forces are keen to stress it needs to be an afghan solution - it is something politically that must be done by the people themselves .
everyone here agrees that the nato mission , to bring peace and development to afghanistan and win over the people for the democratic government , will not succeed through fighting alone - it will have to be a political solution .
indeed , the indication from the elders here was that fighting was doing more harm than good .
even the nato force commander , lt gen david richards , has warned the people could back the taleban unless change comes quickly .
it 's a very difficult situation , and one that needs close attention to afghan culture and traditions - it 's also a very slow process - a reminder perhaps of how long it is going to take to make a long and lasting difference in afghanistan .
tuesday 7 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- the sun is just coming up over the horizon and the ration-pack hot chocolate is slowly heating the bbc team up after the most dangerous night yet with the front line 3 commando force in helmand .
they had a slow day sitting it out in the desert waiting for a spare part for one of the vehicles and meeting up with the british team mentoring the afghan national army .
the afghan national army have been keeping the taleban at bay we will be spending a few days with them , so it was the first chance to see some of the afghan soldiers who will take over responsibility for security in the country when international forces eventually leave .
it was as we bedded down for the night that the call came to stand by and be ready to move at a moment 's notice .
the town which the marine commandos have been moving in and around , but which i 've been asked not to name here for security reasons , is pretty much under the control of the taleban , apart from the small collection of buildings and compounds which make up the district centre .
the afghan national police -lrb- anp -rrb- have been fighting off nightly attacks on a number of fronts , but felt they needed help and called for british reinforcements .
the most dangerous part of the trip was the route in , not knowing if another ambush would be waiting - as it had been when the patrol left the town a few days ago .
it was like daylight driving towards the town , the moon still full , and i felt a mixture of excitement and fear about the operation .
a pistol was left near us " in case things go wrong " - we had been shown how to use one , just as a last resort , the day before .
extra mortar bombs were loaded in the vehicle and as we began the dash into the town you could see bullets flying across from right to left far in front of us .
but surprisingly it was quiet - we reached the checkpoints and snipers took up positions , and a rocket was made ready .
the afghan police who were manning the sandbagged positions excitedly pointed six or seven hundred metres away in different directions saying " taleban " and then trying to explain to us in sign language how they had held them off .
on top of one of the mud buildings used as a firing position there were bullet cases scattered about the rickety roof - afghan police gave out tea .
then there was movement out in no-man 's land , picked up by night-vision and heat-sensitive binoculars - the marines said they saw through the sights men carrying weapons , and that had been confirmed from another viewing point .
the snipers fired two shots and illuminating shells exploded above , lighting up the town .
then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
the route into the town was the most dangerous part of the trip i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
afghan soldiers will eventually take over security the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .
sunday 5 november 0600 -lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- the front line team of 3 commando brigade managed to stay out of trouble today in the helmand desert , but picked up quite a lot of information from local people .
reflecting on a lucky escape ...
there was a report back from the town where the ambush had taken place yesterday - and if believable it was good news for the british forces .
during the battle a number of artillery shells were fired , and one had , according to intelligence , hit a group of withdrawing taleban fighters .
reports like this often come in - for example after wednesday 's clash they heard more than 30 insurgents had been injured or killed - but it 's almost impossible to verify , or to know if civilians were among the casualties .
we saw first hand how a bombing raid was stopped at the last minute to avoid " collateral damage , " but the dropping of a 2000lb bomb in part of a village had been only seconds away .
some information comes from funerals and eye witnesses , but there 's no way of telling what could be the impact of the bombing and the shelling .
military discipline is crucial for living and coping in the desert and the marines on the patrol are the first to admit how difficult it is to tell civilians from taleban fighters when they are not actually shooting at them .
some of those the patrol came across today complained that the fighting was doing more harm than good to the village and its residents , and more should be done to stop the fighting .
but with the taleban very much in control of the town it 's not easy - the afghan security forces there were bombarded heavily after dark .
on the drive today , we also managed to get a good look at the landscape along the helmand river valley which winds right through the province .
the marines picked up some pleasing news from the locals most people live along the narrow band of water-fed greenery which rears out of mile after mile of barren desert .
many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .
saturday 4 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- there was a quiet start to another day in the desert , but the afternoon brought another fire-fight , the second in two days and this one even closer than the first .
the bbc team has frequently come under fire with british troops the royal marines 3 commando brigade are pushing out into southern helmand province , trying to get a feel for the taleban - how much of a threat they are and in which areas , and our three-man crew is with them .
there were reports of thousands of refugees being forced out of the towns where fighting has been the most intense , but today the intelligence proved to be wrong .
the patrol came across people living in tents outside the town with families and animals in tow , but with the help of a translator , the troop commander discovered they were nomadic kuchis and knew little about the taleban .
the patrol medic is david blades , 26 , and his job is n't just to help his own colleagues , but assist the local people however he can .
so after chatting about the fighting , it was down to the injured foot and the nasty case of heartburn - the latter was easy , but the former was impossible to cure - the patient had glass in his foot , but it had been there so long the skin had healed up and needed an operation .
go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .
giving some medicine at least makes them feel better , " he told me .
this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
homes in helmand province evoke another age at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
the nomadic kuchi know little about the taleban it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
medic david blades does what he can to help they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .
a final rocket from the taleban landed short and a major engagement with their enemy came to an end .
" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
the marines hit back at a suspect position using a 1,00lb bomb in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
q & a : uk troops it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .
surrounding us are pairs of highly armed if scantily-armoured patrol vehicles , with a .50 calibre machine gun on each pointing out from our small corral .
each vehicle will be manned all night long .
we are a few kilometres from a town that is still largely under the control of the taleban .
the force is tasked with roaming the desert for weeks on end , feeding back information to headquarters and fighting back if attacked .
the marines drove through the town to show their presence .
they expected to come under fire , but it remained quiet .
there were a few children playing , a few farmers ploughing their dusty fields and a few people driving camels to their own corral , the huge beasts hopping , their front feet bound together to stop them running away .
we headed back into the desert and grabbed our rations just before sunset - it was too late to light the small solid fuel stoves and heat up the meal in a bag - as we had to be in place well out of sight or sound of the town before it got dark .
troops do get down time , but there are few diversions in the desert but after a day being battered about in the back of a small patrol vehicle , open to the beating desert sun , any food hot or cold was welcome , as was the chocolate .
the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .
they met up with the artillery gunners who provide support for the force as it stays constantly on the move , never staying overnight in the same place twice and always prepared to call for artillery support and for air power if needed .
the force we are with is a specialist unit used to these arduous conditions - and to the risk of ambush and attack .
this could prove to be a fascinating week .

here are his daily reports on life with the troops , with the most recent one at the top .
friday 10 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- small stones and fine sand were whipped up into our faces as the chinook transporter helicopter landed in the desert to whisk us back to camp bastion .
the end of the road for fred , peter and alastair our embedded trip with the royal marine commandos in southern helmand had come to an end and we loaded up our equipment alongside tyres , a large gun that was being replaced and a few people heading back like us .
the final night had seen the marine commandos use two more rockets to kill , they say , a further three taleban fighters in a bunker they had been monitoring for a number of days .
we accompanied the afghan national army on a foot patrol around a village and it was interesting to see the british mentoring and training team 's idea of meeting people to gather intelligence rubbing off .
as i said on thursday , it 's the way forward to train up the army and police , but i remain to be convinced as to whether the language and cultural barrier is just too great to see major progress in the next few years .
we left them moving into another village where they came under fire - it 's still a dangerous place .
over the past few days our team of fred scott -lrb- cameraman -rrb- , peter emmerson -lrb- producer -rrb- and i have had a unique insight into how the front-line forces operate .
we were very impressed by the soldiers ' professionalism , commitment and morale - they welcomed and protected us in a very dangerous environment .
winning hearts and minds they are a specialist group of commandos , at the sharp end of the continuing war against the taleban - and incidentally monday will mark five years since the coalition forced the taleban out of kabul .
they have the military prowess and the superior equipment - be it night-vision , heat-sensing goggles , the backup of artillery and air power and the tactical awareness .
but the taleban have the best defensive positions , know the terrain , and by luring the british forces to attack them , are forcing the marines to drop bombs on and around villages .
it 's a real stalemate , and it really has been going nowhere .
the patrol commander would say they have taken the tactical advantage , by moving into the town , but yet remaining mobile , but the majority of people are still living in surrounding villages to avoid the fighting .
it 's difficult to chase hearts and minds when they are running from you .
the war continues , and there 's still no convincing proof the overall policy of security first , and then development and better governance hot on its heels , will make a difference .
winning people over is still the aim , but it 's not as easy as it may have seemed in the military war gaming .
but , on a lighter note , i have a quiz to bring this blog to an end .
the royal marine commandos have a language all of their own - we had to pick it up as we went along .
see how you would do .
translate the following : 1 - " it 's redders today " 2 - " i 'm threaders with this . " 3 - " pass the oggin " 4 - " fancy a goffa " 5 - " it 's gen " 6 - " spin the dit " 7 - " where 's the gash bag ? " 8 - " that 's hoofin ' that is " answers : 1 - " it 's hot today " 2 - " i 'm fed up with this " 3 - " pass the water " 4 - " fancy a fizzy drink " -lrb- nb : can also mean a punch , or to be knocked over by a wave while on board ship -rrb- 5 - " ' it 's genuine " 6 - " tell me a good story " -lrb- preferably an exaggerated one -rrb- 7 - " where 's the rubbish bin ? " 8 - " that 's great / brilliant / excellent " thursday 9 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- i spent some time with one of the british teams helping to mentor the afghan national army , the future of afghanistan , and the exit strategy for the nato and us forces .
but it 's an indication of just how long the whole process will take when you see the newly trained soldiers working alongside the royal marine commandos .
afghan national police and their vehicle of choice - a pick-up truck the transport of choice for the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- is a twin-cab pickup truck - there 's enough room to cram an extraordinary number onto the back - all proudly armed with rocket propelled grenades , and with belts of ammunition wrapped around their chests .
the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
people moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .

then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
the route into the town was the most dangerous part of the trip i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
afghan soldiers will eventually take over security the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .
sunday 5 november 0600 -lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- the front line team of 3 commando brigade managed to stay out of trouble today in the helmand desert , but picked up quite a lot of information from local people .
reflecting on a lucky escape ...
there was a report back from the town where the ambush had taken place yesterday - and if believable it was good news for the british forces .
during the battle a number of artillery shells were fired , and one had , according to intelligence , hit a group of withdrawing taleban fighters .
reports like this often come in - for example after wednesday 's clash they heard more than 30 insurgents had been injured or killed - but it 's almost impossible to verify , or to know if civilians were among the casualties .
we saw first hand how a bombing raid was stopped at the last minute to avoid " collateral damage , " but the dropping of a 2000lb bomb in part of a village had been only seconds away .
some information comes from funerals and eye witnesses , but there 's no way of telling what could be the impact of the bombing and the shelling .
military discipline is crucial for living and coping in the desert and the marines on the patrol are the first to admit how difficult it is to tell civilians from taleban fighters when they are not actually shooting at them .
some of those the patrol came across today complained that the fighting was doing more harm than good to the village and its residents , and more should be done to stop the fighting .
but with the taleban very much in control of the town it 's not easy - the afghan security forces there were bombarded heavily after dark .
on the drive today , we also managed to get a good look at the landscape along the helmand river valley which winds right through the province .
the marines picked up some pleasing news from the locals most people live along the narrow band of water-fed greenery which rears out of mile after mile of barren desert .
many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .
saturday 4 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- there was a quiet start to another day in the desert , but the afternoon brought another fire-fight , the second in two days and this one even closer than the first .
the bbc team has frequently come under fire with british troops the royal marines 3 commando brigade are pushing out into southern helmand province , trying to get a feel for the taleban - how much of a threat they are and in which areas , and our three-man crew is with them .
there were reports of thousands of refugees being forced out of the towns where fighting has been the most intense , but today the intelligence proved to be wrong .
the patrol came across people living in tents outside the town with families and animals in tow , but with the help of a translator , the troop commander discovered they were nomadic kuchis and knew little about the taleban .
the patrol medic is david blades , 26 , and his job is n't just to help his own colleagues , but assist the local people however he can .
so after chatting about the fighting , it was down to the injured foot and the nasty case of heartburn - the latter was easy , but the former was impossible to cure - the patient had glass in his foot , but it had been there so long the skin had healed up and needed an operation .
go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .
giving some medicine at least makes them feel better , " he told me .
this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
homes in helmand province evoke another age at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
the nomadic kuchi know little about the taleban it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
medic david blades does what he can to help they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .
a final rocket from the taleban landed short and a major engagement with their enemy came to an end .
" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
the marines hit back at a suspect position using a 1,00lb bomb in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
q & a : uk troops it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .
surrounding us are pairs of highly armed if scantily-armoured patrol vehicles , with a .50 calibre machine gun on each pointing out from our small corral .
each vehicle will be manned all night long .
we are a few kilometres from a town that is still largely under the control of the taleban .
the force is tasked with roaming the desert for weeks on end , feeding back information to headquarters and fighting back if attacked .
the marines drove through the town to show their presence .
they expected to come under fire , but it remained quiet .
there were a few children playing , a few farmers ploughing their dusty fields and a few people driving camels to their own corral , the huge beasts hopping , their front feet bound together to stop them running away .
we headed back into the desert and grabbed our rations just before sunset - it was too late to light the small solid fuel stoves and heat up the meal in a bag - as we had to be in place well out of sight or sound of the town before it got dark .
troops do get down time , but there are few diversions in the desert but after a day being battered about in the back of a small patrol vehicle , open to the beating desert sun , any food hot or cold was welcome , as was the chocolate .
the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .
they met up with the artillery gunners who provide support for the force as it stays constantly on the move , never staying overnight in the same place twice and always prepared to call for artillery support and for air power if needed .
the force we are with is a specialist unit used to these arduous conditions - and to the risk of ambush and attack .
this could prove to be a fascinating week .

here are his daily reports on life with the troops , with the most recent one at the top .
friday 10 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- small stones and fine sand were whipped up into our faces as the chinook transporter helicopter landed in the desert to whisk us back to camp bastion .
the end of the road for fred , peter and alastair our embedded trip with the royal marine commandos in southern helmand had come to an end and we loaded up our equipment alongside tyres , a large gun that was being replaced and a few people heading back like us .
the final night had seen the marine commandos use two more rockets to kill , they say , a further three taleban fighters in a bunker they had been monitoring for a number of days .
we accompanied the afghan national army on a foot patrol around a village and it was interesting to see the british mentoring and training team 's idea of meeting people to gather intelligence rubbing off .
as i said on thursday , it 's the way forward to train up the army and police , but i remain to be convinced as to whether the language and cultural barrier is just too great to see major progress in the next few years .
we left them moving into another village where they came under fire - it 's still a dangerous place .
over the past few days our team of fred scott -lrb- cameraman -rrb- , peter emmerson -lrb- producer -rrb- and i have had a unique insight into how the front-line forces operate .
we were very impressed by the soldiers ' professionalism , commitment and morale - they welcomed and protected us in a very dangerous environment .
winning hearts and minds they are a specialist group of commandos , at the sharp end of the continuing war against the taleban - and incidentally monday will mark five years since the coalition forced the taleban out of kabul .
they have the military prowess and the superior equipment - be it night-vision , heat-sensing goggles , the backup of artillery and air power and the tactical awareness .
but the taleban have the best defensive positions , know the terrain , and by luring the british forces to attack them , are forcing the marines to drop bombs on and around villages .
it 's a real stalemate , and it really has been going nowhere .
the patrol commander would say they have taken the tactical advantage , by moving into the town , but yet remaining mobile , but the majority of people are still living in surrounding villages to avoid the fighting .
it 's difficult to chase hearts and minds when they are running from you .
the war continues , and there 's still no convincing proof the overall policy of security first , and then development and better governance hot on its heels , will make a difference .
winning people over is still the aim , but it 's not as easy as it may have seemed in the military war gaming .
but , on a lighter note , i have a quiz to bring this blog to an end .
the royal marine commandos have a language all of their own - we had to pick it up as we went along .
see how you would do .
translate the following : 1 - " it 's redders today " 2 - " i 'm threaders with this . " 3 - " pass the oggin " 4 - " fancy a goffa " 5 - " it 's gen " 6 - " spin the dit " 7 - " where 's the gash bag ? " 8 - " that 's hoofin ' that is " answers : 1 - " it 's hot today " 2 - " i 'm fed up with this " 3 - " pass the water " 4 - " fancy a fizzy drink " -lrb- nb : can also mean a punch , or to be knocked over by a wave while on board ship -rrb- 5 - " ' it 's genuine " 6 - " tell me a good story " -lrb- preferably an exaggerated one -rrb- 7 - " where 's the rubbish bin ? " 8 - " that 's great / brilliant / excellent " thursday 9 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- i spent some time with one of the british teams helping to mentor the afghan national army , the future of afghanistan , and the exit strategy for the nato and us forces .
but it 's an indication of just how long the whole process will take when you see the newly trained soldiers working alongside the royal marine commandos .
afghan national police and their vehicle of choice - a pick-up truck the transport of choice for the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- is a twin-cab pickup truck - there 's enough room to cram an extraordinary number onto the back - all proudly armed with rocket propelled grenades , and with belts of ammunition wrapped around their chests .
the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
people moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .
maintaining good communications is vital the situation in this town is something of a stalemate , with the taleban six or seven hundred metres away not firing , nor even popping out to take a look - perhaps after last night 's clash .
a shot has just been fired - it happens from time to time - punctuating the evening , but neither side at the moment is gaining any ground - and that situation is playing into the hands of the taleban as each clash destroys buildings or farmland and nibbles away at the hearts and minds the british are so keen to win .
a meeting took place between the elders of the town and a high-level british officer - brokered by the troop commander over the past few days .
they drove out into the desert on the back of a tractor for a " shura " or meeting - grey and white bearded men crushed into the back .
unfolding themselves from the trailer they sat in a circle on red blankets with cups of tea in plastic cups provided by their british hosts .
the first meeting came about after they had spent 10 hours wandering the desert looking for the british patrol .
their main complaint was that every time the british came near villages the taleban fired on them and then the return fire from the marines - artillery , aircraft and heavy weapons , as i have described , was causing people to flee and destroying homes - putting civilians very much in the line of fire .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is spending time with troops they wanted the taleban out , but they did n't want the daily skirmishes to go on , they said - it was bad for the people .
it 's hoped this might be the first step towards some form of ceasefire - similar perhaps to the deal done in musa qala , which is still holding , despite scepticism that it 's not the way forward .
but the british forces are keen to stress it needs to be an afghan solution - it is something politically that must be done by the people themselves .
everyone here agrees that the nato mission , to bring peace and development to afghanistan and win over the people for the democratic government , will not succeed through fighting alone - it will have to be a political solution .
indeed , the indication from the elders here was that fighting was doing more harm than good .
even the nato force commander , lt gen david richards , has warned the people could back the taleban unless change comes quickly .
it 's a very difficult situation , and one that needs close attention to afghan culture and traditions - it 's also a very slow process - a reminder perhaps of how long it is going to take to make a long and lasting difference in afghanistan .
tuesday 7 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- the sun is just coming up over the horizon and the ration-pack hot chocolate is slowly heating the bbc team up after the most dangerous night yet with the front line 3 commando force in helmand .
they had a slow day sitting it out in the desert waiting for a spare part for one of the vehicles and meeting up with the british team mentoring the afghan national army .
the afghan national army have been keeping the taleban at bay we will be spending a few days with them , so it was the first chance to see some of the afghan soldiers who will take over responsibility for security in the country when international forces eventually leave .
it was as we bedded down for the night that the call came to stand by and be ready to move at a moment 's notice .
the town which the marine commandos have been moving in and around , but which i 've been asked not to name here for security reasons , is pretty much under the control of the taleban , apart from the small collection of buildings and compounds which make up the district centre .
the afghan national police -lrb- anp -rrb- have been fighting off nightly attacks on a number of fronts , but felt they needed help and called for british reinforcements .
the most dangerous part of the trip was the route in , not knowing if another ambush would be waiting - as it had been when the patrol left the town a few days ago .
it was like daylight driving towards the town , the moon still full , and i felt a mixture of excitement and fear about the operation .
a pistol was left near us " in case things go wrong " - we had been shown how to use one , just as a last resort , the day before .
extra mortar bombs were loaded in the vehicle and as we began the dash into the town you could see bullets flying across from right to left far in front of us .
but surprisingly it was quiet - we reached the checkpoints and snipers took up positions , and a rocket was made ready .
the afghan police who were manning the sandbagged positions excitedly pointed six or seven hundred metres away in different directions saying " taleban " and then trying to explain to us in sign language how they had held them off .
on top of one of the mud buildings used as a firing position there were bullet cases scattered about the rickety roof - afghan police gave out tea .
then there was movement out in no-man 's land , picked up by night-vision and heat-sensitive binoculars - the marines said they saw through the sights men carrying weapons , and that had been confirmed from another viewing point .
the snipers fired two shots and illuminating shells exploded above , lighting up the town .
then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
the route into the town was the most dangerous part of the trip i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
afghan soldiers will eventually take over security the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .

many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .

go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .

this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
homes in helmand province evoke another age at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
the nomadic kuchi know little about the taleban it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
medic david blades does what he can to help they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .
a final rocket from the taleban landed short and a major engagement with their enemy came to an end .
" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
the marines hit back at a suspect position using a 1,00lb bomb in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
q & a : uk troops it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .
surrounding us are pairs of highly armed if scantily-armoured patrol vehicles , with a .50 calibre machine gun on each pointing out from our small corral .
each vehicle will be manned all night long .
we are a few kilometres from a town that is still largely under the control of the taleban .
the force is tasked with roaming the desert for weeks on end , feeding back information to headquarters and fighting back if attacked .
the marines drove through the town to show their presence .
they expected to come under fire , but it remained quiet .
there were a few children playing , a few farmers ploughing their dusty fields and a few people driving camels to their own corral , the huge beasts hopping , their front feet bound together to stop them running away .
we headed back into the desert and grabbed our rations just before sunset - it was too late to light the small solid fuel stoves and heat up the meal in a bag - as we had to be in place well out of sight or sound of the town before it got dark .
troops do get down time , but there are few diversions in the desert but after a day being battered about in the back of a small patrol vehicle , open to the beating desert sun , any food hot or cold was welcome , as was the chocolate .
the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .
they met up with the artillery gunners who provide support for the force as it stays constantly on the move , never staying overnight in the same place twice and always prepared to call for artillery support and for air power if needed .
the force we are with is a specialist unit used to these arduous conditions - and to the risk of ambush and attack .
this could prove to be a fascinating week .

here are his daily reports on life with the troops , with the most recent one at the top .
friday 10 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- small stones and fine sand were whipped up into our faces as the chinook transporter helicopter landed in the desert to whisk us back to camp bastion .
the end of the road for fred , peter and alastair our embedded trip with the royal marine commandos in southern helmand had come to an end and we loaded up our equipment alongside tyres , a large gun that was being replaced and a few people heading back like us .
the final night had seen the marine commandos use two more rockets to kill , they say , a further three taleban fighters in a bunker they had been monitoring for a number of days .
we accompanied the afghan national army on a foot patrol around a village and it was interesting to see the british mentoring and training team 's idea of meeting people to gather intelligence rubbing off .
as i said on thursday , it 's the way forward to train up the army and police , but i remain to be convinced as to whether the language and cultural barrier is just too great to see major progress in the next few years .
we left them moving into another village where they came under fire - it 's still a dangerous place .
over the past few days our team of fred scott -lrb- cameraman -rrb- , peter emmerson -lrb- producer -rrb- and i have had a unique insight into how the front-line forces operate .
we were very impressed by the soldiers ' professionalism , commitment and morale - they welcomed and protected us in a very dangerous environment .
winning hearts and minds they are a specialist group of commandos , at the sharp end of the continuing war against the taleban - and incidentally monday will mark five years since the coalition forced the taleban out of kabul .
they have the military prowess and the superior equipment - be it night-vision , heat-sensing goggles , the backup of artillery and air power and the tactical awareness .
but the taleban have the best defensive positions , know the terrain , and by luring the british forces to attack them , are forcing the marines to drop bombs on and around villages .
it 's a real stalemate , and it really has been going nowhere .
the patrol commander would say they have taken the tactical advantage , by moving into the town , but yet remaining mobile , but the majority of people are still living in surrounding villages to avoid the fighting .
it 's difficult to chase hearts and minds when they are running from you .
the war continues , and there 's still no convincing proof the overall policy of security first , and then development and better governance hot on its heels , will make a difference .
winning people over is still the aim , but it 's not as easy as it may have seemed in the military war gaming .
but , on a lighter note , i have a quiz to bring this blog to an end .
the royal marine commandos have a language all of their own - we had to pick it up as we went along .
see how you would do .
translate the following : 1 - " it 's redders today " 2 - " i 'm threaders with this . " 3 - " pass the oggin " 4 - " fancy a goffa " 5 - " it 's gen " 6 - " spin the dit " 7 - " where 's the gash bag ? " 8 - " that 's hoofin ' that is " answers : 1 - " it 's hot today " 2 - " i 'm fed up with this " 3 - " pass the water " 4 - " fancy a fizzy drink " -lrb- nb : can also mean a punch , or to be knocked over by a wave while on board ship -rrb- 5 - " ' it 's genuine " 6 - " tell me a good story " -lrb- preferably an exaggerated one -rrb- 7 - " where 's the rubbish bin ? " 8 - " that 's great / brilliant / excellent " thursday 9 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- i spent some time with one of the british teams helping to mentor the afghan national army , the future of afghanistan , and the exit strategy for the nato and us forces .
but it 's an indication of just how long the whole process will take when you see the newly trained soldiers working alongside the royal marine commandos .
afghan national police and their vehicle of choice - a pick-up truck the transport of choice for the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- is a twin-cab pickup truck - there 's enough room to cram an extraordinary number onto the back - all proudly armed with rocket propelled grenades , and with belts of ammunition wrapped around their chests .
the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
people moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .
maintaining good communications is vital the situation in this town is something of a stalemate , with the taleban six or seven hundred metres away not firing , nor even popping out to take a look - perhaps after last night 's clash .
a shot has just been fired - it happens from time to time - punctuating the evening , but neither side at the moment is gaining any ground - and that situation is playing into the hands of the taleban as each clash destroys buildings or farmland and nibbles away at the hearts and minds the british are so keen to win .
a meeting took place between the elders of the town and a high-level british officer - brokered by the troop commander over the past few days .
they drove out into the desert on the back of a tractor for a " shura " or meeting - grey and white bearded men crushed into the back .
unfolding themselves from the trailer they sat in a circle on red blankets with cups of tea in plastic cups provided by their british hosts .
the first meeting came about after they had spent 10 hours wandering the desert looking for the british patrol .
their main complaint was that every time the british came near villages the taleban fired on them and then the return fire from the marines - artillery , aircraft and heavy weapons , as i have described , was causing people to flee and destroying homes - putting civilians very much in the line of fire .
the bbc 's alastair leithead is spending time with troops they wanted the taleban out , but they did n't want the daily skirmishes to go on , they said - it was bad for the people .
it 's hoped this might be the first step towards some form of ceasefire - similar perhaps to the deal done in musa qala , which is still holding , despite scepticism that it 's not the way forward .
but the british forces are keen to stress it needs to be an afghan solution - it is something politically that must be done by the people themselves .
everyone here agrees that the nato mission , to bring peace and development to afghanistan and win over the people for the democratic government , will not succeed through fighting alone - it will have to be a political solution .
indeed , the indication from the elders here was that fighting was doing more harm than good .
even the nato force commander , lt gen david richards , has warned the people could back the taleban unless change comes quickly .
it 's a very difficult situation , and one that needs close attention to afghan culture and traditions - it 's also a very slow process - a reminder perhaps of how long it is going to take to make a long and lasting difference in afghanistan .
tuesday 7 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- the sun is just coming up over the horizon and the ration-pack hot chocolate is slowly heating the bbc team up after the most dangerous night yet with the front line 3 commando force in helmand .
they had a slow day sitting it out in the desert waiting for a spare part for one of the vehicles and meeting up with the british team mentoring the afghan national army .
the afghan national army have been keeping the taleban at bay we will be spending a few days with them , so it was the first chance to see some of the afghan soldiers who will take over responsibility for security in the country when international forces eventually leave .
it was as we bedded down for the night that the call came to stand by and be ready to move at a moment 's notice .
the town which the marine commandos have been moving in and around , but which i 've been asked not to name here for security reasons , is pretty much under the control of the taleban , apart from the small collection of buildings and compounds which make up the district centre .
the afghan national police -lrb- anp -rrb- have been fighting off nightly attacks on a number of fronts , but felt they needed help and called for british reinforcements .
the most dangerous part of the trip was the route in , not knowing if another ambush would be waiting - as it had been when the patrol left the town a few days ago .
it was like daylight driving towards the town , the moon still full , and i felt a mixture of excitement and fear about the operation .
a pistol was left near us " in case things go wrong " - we had been shown how to use one , just as a last resort , the day before .
extra mortar bombs were loaded in the vehicle and as we began the dash into the town you could see bullets flying across from right to left far in front of us .
but surprisingly it was quiet - we reached the checkpoints and snipers took up positions , and a rocket was made ready .
the afghan police who were manning the sandbagged positions excitedly pointed six or seven hundred metres away in different directions saying " taleban " and then trying to explain to us in sign language how they had held them off .
on top of one of the mud buildings used as a firing position there were bullet cases scattered about the rickety roof - afghan police gave out tea .
then there was movement out in no-man 's land , picked up by night-vision and heat-sensitive binoculars - the marines said they saw through the sights men carrying weapons , and that had been confirmed from another viewing point .
the snipers fired two shots and illuminating shells exploded above , lighting up the town .
then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
the route into the town was the most dangerous part of the trip i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
afghan soldiers will eventually take over security the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .
sunday 5 november 0600 -lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- the front line team of 3 commando brigade managed to stay out of trouble today in the helmand desert , but picked up quite a lot of information from local people .
reflecting on a lucky escape ...
there was a report back from the town where the ambush had taken place yesterday - and if believable it was good news for the british forces .
during the battle a number of artillery shells were fired , and one had , according to intelligence , hit a group of withdrawing taleban fighters .
reports like this often come in - for example after wednesday 's clash they heard more than 30 insurgents had been injured or killed - but it 's almost impossible to verify , or to know if civilians were among the casualties .
we saw first hand how a bombing raid was stopped at the last minute to avoid " collateral damage , " but the dropping of a 2000lb bomb in part of a village had been only seconds away .
some information comes from funerals and eye witnesses , but there 's no way of telling what could be the impact of the bombing and the shelling .
military discipline is crucial for living and coping in the desert and the marines on the patrol are the first to admit how difficult it is to tell civilians from taleban fighters when they are not actually shooting at them .
some of those the patrol came across today complained that the fighting was doing more harm than good to the village and its residents , and more should be done to stop the fighting .
but with the taleban very much in control of the town it 's not easy - the afghan security forces there were bombarded heavily after dark .
on the drive today , we also managed to get a good look at the landscape along the helmand river valley which winds right through the province .
the marines picked up some pleasing news from the locals most people live along the narrow band of water-fed greenery which rears out of mile after mile of barren desert .
many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .
saturday 4 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- there was a quiet start to another day in the desert , but the afternoon brought another fire-fight , the second in two days and this one even closer than the first .
the bbc team has frequently come under fire with british troops the royal marines 3 commando brigade are pushing out into southern helmand province , trying to get a feel for the taleban - how much of a threat they are and in which areas , and our three-man crew is with them .
there were reports of thousands of refugees being forced out of the towns where fighting has been the most intense , but today the intelligence proved to be wrong .
the patrol came across people living in tents outside the town with families and animals in tow , but with the help of a translator , the troop commander discovered they were nomadic kuchis and knew little about the taleban .
the patrol medic is david blades , 26 , and his job is n't just to help his own colleagues , but assist the local people however he can .
so after chatting about the fighting , it was down to the injured foot and the nasty case of heartburn - the latter was easy , but the former was impossible to cure - the patient had glass in his foot , but it had been there so long the skin had healed up and needed an operation .
go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .
giving some medicine at least makes them feel better , " he told me .
this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
homes in helmand province evoke another age at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
the nomadic kuchi know little about the taleban it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
medic david blades does what he can to help they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .

" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
the marines hit back at a suspect position using a 1,00lb bomb in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
q & a : uk troops it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .

the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .

here are his daily reports on life with the troops , with the most recent one at the top .
friday 10 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- small stones and fine sand were whipped up into our faces as the chinook transporter helicopter landed in the desert to whisk us back to camp bastion .
our embedded trip with the royal marine commandos in southern helmand had come to an end and we loaded up our equipment alongside tyres , a large gun that was being replaced and a few people heading back like us .
the final night had seen the marine commandos use two more rockets to kill , they say , a further three taleban fighters in a bunker they had been monitoring for a number of days .
we accompanied the afghan national army on a foot patrol around a village and it was interesting to see the british mentoring and training team 's idea of meeting people to gather intelligence rubbing off .
as i said on thursday , it 's the way forward to train up the army and police , but i remain to be convinced as to whether the language and cultural barrier is just too great to see major progress in the next few years .
we left them moving into another village where they came under fire - it 's still a dangerous place .
over the past few days our team of fred scott -lrb- cameraman -rrb- , peter emmerson -lrb- producer -rrb- and i have had a unique insight into how the front-line forces operate .
we were very impressed by the soldiers ' professionalism , commitment and morale - they welcomed and protected us in a very dangerous environment .
they are a specialist group of commandos , at the sharp end of the continuing war against the taleban - and incidentally monday will mark five years since the coalition forced the taleban out of kabul .
they have the military prowess and the superior equipment - be it night-vision , heat-sensing goggles , the backup of artillery and air power and the tactical awareness .
but the taleban have the best defensive positions , know the terrain , and by luring the british forces to attack them , are forcing the marines to drop bombs on and around villages .
it 's a real stalemate , and it really has been going nowhere .
the patrol commander would say they have taken the tactical advantage , by moving into the town , but yet remaining mobile , but the majority of people are still living in surrounding villages to avoid the fighting .
it 's difficult to chase hearts and minds when they are running from you .
the war continues , and there 's still no convincing proof the overall policy of security first , and then development and better governance hot on its heels , will make a difference .
winning people over is still the aim , but it 's not as easy as it may have seemed in the military war gaming .
but , on a lighter note , i have a quiz to bring this blog to an end .
the royal marine commandos have a language all of their own - we had to pick it up as we went along .
see how you would do .
translate the following : 1 - " it 's redders today " 2 - " i 'm threaders with this . " 3 - " pass the oggin " 4 - " fancy a goffa " 5 - " it 's gen " 6 - " spin the dit " 7 - " where 's the gash bag ? " 8 - " that 's hoofin ' that is " answers : 1 - " it 's hot today " 2 - " i 'm fed up with this " 3 - " pass the water " 4 - " fancy a fizzy drink " -lrb- nb : can also mean a punch , or to be knocked over by a wave while on board ship -rrb- 5 - " ' it 's genuine " 6 - " tell me a good story " -lrb- preferably an exaggerated one -rrb- 7 - " where 's the rubbish bin ? " 8 - " that 's great / brilliant / excellent " thursday 9 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- i spent some time with one of the british teams helping to mentor the afghan national army , the future of afghanistan , and the exit strategy for the nato and us forces .
but it 's an indication of just how long the whole process will take when you see the newly trained soldiers working alongside the royal marine commandos .
the transport of choice for the afghan national army -lrb- ana -rrb- is a twin-cab pickup truck - there 's enough room to cram an extraordinary number onto the back - all proudly armed with rocket propelled grenades , and with belts of ammunition wrapped around their chests .
the atmosphere , rather than being disciplined and professional , is far more party-orientated - they are constantly playing tricks on each other .
a new barracks , costing $ 70m and paid for by the us , is being filled with afghan soldiers at the moment - when asked how long it would last , the contractor said , " it 's the fittings i 'm worried about - one of their favourite games is throwing their shoes at the ceiling fan . "
but this again goes back to cultural differences - they are tough and hard-fighting men with war in their blood , but so much of what the west is giving or expects is so alien to them .
the kind of gun safety you see in the british army is just not manly here - a few weeks ago i was told one ana soldier accidentally fired a rocket-propelled grenade he was holding and the flash was right next to his face .
his colleagues just laughed as he was taken off to hospital with serious burns .
one thursday night in their camp , an argument went wrong , shots were fired and one soldier was killed and two badly injured .
the british role is not training , they say , it is " mentoring " - trying to suggest best practice .
the biggest challenge is setting up a re-supply chain as there have been times when the ana have fought , overstretched themselves , run out of food and water and have been ambushed on the way back to their base .
but as a british officer explained , they have had 12 weeks more training than many of the taleban fighters and a sandhurst model of officer training which is going on will take time but there is progress , however slow .
we went with them into the district centre and wandered around a market , completely abandoned - all the people have moved out to surrounding villages to avoid the fighting - not what you might expect from a " hearts and minds " mission .
and you just have to look at the afghan national police to see how far the army has come .
i am at the police checkpoint again in the town centre , and they have been smoking drugs and are now chatting , singing songs , and asking the british troops if they can try out the helmets , body armour and night vision goggles .
and they will soon be asleep while the british troops keep watch over the town overnight and hit taleban sentry posts with remote controlled rockets .
it 's easy to poke fun , but this is the future of afghan security ... and that alone illustrates how much of a long haul it will be for british forces - and how important the job is .
wednesday 8 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- another night in the district centre - i 'm writing this blog outside an afghan national police checkpoint , bolstered up by british forces for another night .
again the fleece over my head is shutting out the light from my laptop , but it 's not as important to be hidden here - the afghan police are chatting loudly , the roaring fire boiling endless cups of tea in a bare and bombed-out building .
the situation in this town is something of a stalemate , with the taleban six or seven hundred metres away not firing , nor even popping out to take a look - perhaps after last night 's clash .
a shot has just been fired - it happens from time to time - punctuating the evening , but neither side at the moment is gaining any ground - and that situation is playing into the hands of the taleban as each clash destroys buildings or farmland and nibbles away at the hearts and minds the british are so keen to win .
a meeting took place between the elders of the town and a high-level british officer - brokered by the troop commander over the past few days .
they drove out into the desert on the back of a tractor for a " shura " or meeting - grey and white bearded men crushed into the back .
unfolding themselves from the trailer they sat in a circle on red blankets with cups of tea in plastic cups provided by their british hosts .
the first meeting came about after they had spent 10 hours wandering the desert looking for the british patrol .
their main complaint was that every time the british came near villages the taleban fired on them and then the return fire from the marines - artillery , aircraft and heavy weapons , as i have described , was causing people to flee and destroying homes - putting civilians very much in the line of fire .
they wanted the taleban out , but they did n't want the daily skirmishes to go on , they said - it was bad for the people .
it 's hoped this might be the first step towards some form of ceasefire - similar perhaps to the deal done in musa qala , which is still holding , despite scepticism that it 's not the way forward .
but the british forces are keen to stress it needs to be an afghan solution - it is something politically that must be done by the people themselves .
everyone here agrees that the nato mission , to bring peace and development to afghanistan and win over the people for the democratic government , will not succeed through fighting alone - it will have to be a political solution .
indeed , the indication from the elders here was that fighting was doing more harm than good .
even the nato force commander , lt gen david richards , has warned the people could back the taleban unless change comes quickly .
it 's a very difficult situation , and one that needs close attention to afghan culture and traditions - it 's also a very slow process - a reminder perhaps of how long it is going to take to make a long and lasting difference in afghanistan .
tuesday 7 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- the sun is just coming up over the horizon and the ration-pack hot chocolate is slowly heating the bbc team up after the most dangerous night yet with the front line 3 commando force in helmand .
they had a slow day sitting it out in the desert waiting for a spare part for one of the vehicles and meeting up with the british team mentoring the afghan national army .
we will be spending a few days with them , so it was the first chance to see some of the afghan soldiers who will take over responsibility for security in the country when international forces eventually leave .
it was as we bedded down for the night that the call came to stand by and be ready to move at a moment 's notice .
the town which the marine commandos have been moving in and around , but which i 've been asked not to name here for security reasons , is pretty much under the control of the taleban , apart from the small collection of buildings and compounds which make up the district centre .
the afghan national police -lrb- anp -rrb- have been fighting off nightly attacks on a number of fronts , but felt they needed help and called for british reinforcements .
the most dangerous part of the trip was the route in , not knowing if another ambush would be waiting - as it had been when the patrol left the town a few days ago .
it was like daylight driving towards the town , the moon still full , and i felt a mixture of excitement and fear about the operation .
a pistol was left near us " in case things go wrong " - we had been shown how to use one , just as a last resort , the day before .
extra mortar bombs were loaded in the vehicle and as we began the dash into the town you could see bullets flying across from right to left far in front of us .
but surprisingly it was quiet - we reached the checkpoints and snipers took up positions , and a rocket was made ready .
the afghan police who were manning the sandbagged positions excitedly pointed six or seven hundred metres away in different directions saying " taleban " and then trying to explain to us in sign language how they had held them off .
on top of one of the mud buildings used as a firing position there were bullet cases scattered about the rickety roof - afghan police gave out tea .
then there was movement out in no-man 's land , picked up by night-vision and heat-sensitive binoculars - the marines said they saw through the sights men carrying weapons , and that had been confirmed from another viewing point .
the snipers fired two shots and illuminating shells exploded above , lighting up the town .
then after a few minutes the sniper fired again - twice - his voice crackled over the radio confirming he had seen through the telescopic sight one man killed .
then there was a pause and a crack as a rocket roared from the roof - three men had moved into the open , again the marines said they had been identified as taleban through high-tech viewing equipment .
the rocket was guided at them - one marine said he saw it " charging towards them , they looked up and then they disappeared " .
the radio again confirmed all three men had been killed - there was a strong reaction from the marines behind the sandbags .
and then it fell silent - the night was spent watching and waiting , before withdrawing back into the desert .
monday 6 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- helmand province is a dangerous and unpredictable place and my emotions have been flying about , but tonight it was the sense of space and beauty that dominated all others .
i think it 's a full moon that 's lighting up the camp tonight , and it 's like daylight as the commanders are sitting in a circle discussing tactics and the " bootnecks " are bedding down for the night .
as the patrol drove out here to a remote part of the desert the moon lit up the day 's dust , kicked up by the wind and by the odd car that races across the hardened sand .
it was calm and peaceful , and in marked contrast to the town centre where the fighting has been continuing .
we were drinking tea and having a little ration pack lunch today in view of the tree line which marks taleban territory , when we heard two mortar bombs launch - everyone scampered for helmets , but the rounds fell well short .
more followed and the vehicles edged just a bit further out of range - the next landed close to where the patrol had been parked up .
the pattern is rushes of adrenalin followed by much calmer , peaceful moments when the war can seem a long way away -but it has a habit of very quickly reminding you where you are and what the reality is in much of southern afghanistan .
and there are other dangers - the 24-hour ration packs are very good and if there 's time are heated up on small , metal solid fuel stoves which are light and ideal for boiling water .
the silver bags of ready made food are popped on and 10 or 15 minutes later the meal is piping hot .
i struck a heavy duty match or two on the side of the car and lit the stove , wandering off and thinking little of it , but the first match head had flicked onto a rucksack and it had caught fire .
fred the cameraman spotted the flames licking about a gun propped up at the side and the fire was out in no time , but the fuel , and thousands of rounds of ammunition on board could well have gone up .
that 's when you realise the value of military discipline , and the dangers - other than coming under fire - of living a semi-nomadic life in the desert .
i 've now been denied access to matches .
sunday 5 november 0600 -lrb- 0230 gmt -rrb- the front line team of 3 commando brigade managed to stay out of trouble today in the helmand desert , but picked up quite a lot of information from local people .
there was a report back from the town where the ambush had taken place yesterday - and if believable it was good news for the british forces .
during the battle a number of artillery shells were fired , and one had , according to intelligence , hit a group of withdrawing taleban fighters .
reports like this often come in - for example after wednesday 's clash they heard more than 30 insurgents had been injured or killed - but it 's almost impossible to verify , or to know if civilians were among the casualties .
we saw first hand how a bombing raid was stopped at the last minute to avoid " collateral damage , " but the dropping of a 2000lb bomb in part of a village had been only seconds away .
some information comes from funerals and eye witnesses , but there 's no way of telling what could be the impact of the bombing and the shelling .
and the marines on the patrol are the first to admit how difficult it is to tell civilians from taleban fighters when they are not actually shooting at them .
some of those the patrol came across today complained that the fighting was doing more harm than good to the village and its residents , and more should be done to stop the fighting .
but with the taleban very much in control of the town it 's not easy - the afghan security forces there were bombarded heavily after dark .
on the drive today , we also managed to get a good look at the landscape along the helmand river valley which winds right through the province .
most people live along the narrow band of water-fed greenery which rears out of mile after mile of barren desert .
many are nomads , their houses tents surrounded by straw and with perhaps a mud hut for extra protection .
sheep and goats are tethered , camels tied nearby , and ferocious dogs keep strangers at bay .
the children , many wearing clothes inlaid with sequins that sparkle in the desert sun , gather to gawp at the passing patrol .
it 's a scene and a place from another age caught up in war once again .
saturday 4 november 0630 -lrb- 0300 gmt -rrb- there was a quiet start to another day in the desert , but the afternoon brought another fire-fight , the second in two days and this one even closer than the first .
the royal marines 3 commando brigade are pushing out into southern helmand province , trying to get a feel for the taleban - how much of a threat they are and in which areas , and our three-man crew is with them .
there were reports of thousands of refugees being forced out of the towns where fighting has been the most intense , but today the intelligence proved to be wrong .
the patrol came across people living in tents outside the town with families and animals in tow , but with the help of a translator , the troop commander discovered they were nomadic kuchis and knew little about the taleban .
the patrol medic is david blades , 26 , and his job is n't just to help his own colleagues , but assist the local people however he can .
so after chatting about the fighting , it was down to the injured foot and the nasty case of heartburn - the latter was easy , but the former was impossible to cure - the patient had glass in his foot , but it had been there so long the skin had healed up and needed an operation .
go to a proper doctor was the advice handed out with some fresh bandages - but given the current situation that 's most unlikely to happen .
" for a bit of hearts and minds we can obviously help the locals to the best of our ability , but often they need better treatment .
giving some medicine at least makes them feel better , " he told me .
this mission is the first time david has come under fire , and he admitted " it was a bit nerve-wracking at first , but i 'd rather be here than in the hospital back at base as it 's what we are trained to do . "
and that training had to kick in once again a few hours later .
after heading into a town to meet the local police intelligence officer for an update we came under fire leaving the village .
at first we thought it was stones cracking under the car tyres as we crossed a river , but seconds later the bullets where whipping overhead , each round getting gradually lower as we raced for cover .
the whole patrol was being ambushed .
the heavy machine guns rang out from the armed vehicles , but the attack was from a number of directions .
somehow nobody was hit as the artillery shells landed where the attack had begun .
the british troops at first could not return fire as there were civilians - children - running for cover as the bullets sprayed around , and just seconds before a 2000lb bomb was due to be dropped the firing subsided and with too many civilians around it was called off .
so on the third day on patrol it had been an even closer encounter , but the troops survived unscathed and headed out to spend another night deep in the desert .
thursday 2 november , 2100 -lrb- 1730 gmt -rrb- the rocket propelled grenade skidded between our two vehicles , a mortar bomb detonated in the air just 30 metres from where we had stopped - well in shrapnel range - and ahead of us the royal marine commando 's heavy calibre machine guns were firing into the wood .
it was the first " contact " with the taleban since arriving in the desert , and although it was a surprise when the rocket came so close , it was n't unexpected .
just a few minutes earlier the troop commander and translator had spoken to some elders , representing a number of villagers forced out of their homes , they said , by the taleban .
" do n't go over to that side , " the warning had been , " or they will kill you . "
but the job of the specialist 3 commando force is to use different methods to establish where their enemy is and in what strength - and that means heading into danger .
what they learned from approaching the tree line was that the taleban were well established and in some numbers .
they - and we , filming from the back of a vehicle while keeping our heads well down - were fired upon by mortar bombs , more rocket propelled grenades , heavy machine gun fire - the whole range of weapons the insurgents have .
in turn the royal marine commandos threw everything at the small compound identified as the source of the incoming fire .
after heavy calibre fire and rockets came artillery from 15km away , then an air strike and a 1,000lb bomb , and then a move back into the desert to regroup .
a final rocket from the taleban landed short and a major engagement with their enemy came to an end .
" it does n't get much closer than that " , we were told as the force talked through the frontal attack on the approaching patrol .
quite enough excitement for the morning , but the task of checking vehicles on the road and asking passengers if they had information preceded a supply drop from a chinook helicopter .
back to full strength the patrol worked on into the night , scouring the desert for movement under the light of a three quarter moon , and with the help of special night vision equipment .
in this case the advice of some displaced and disgruntled villagers tipped off the patrol , but it shows how much of a battle can grow from an exchange of fire ... and how much damage the bombs and rockets must be doing to buildings and to a mission which is supposed to be winning people over , not destroying homes .
the force insist there is little they can do , and they have engineers ready to move in and help with development projects .
but for now without being able to even approach the village without coming under attack , it 's clearly going to be a long process .
wednesday 1 november , 1900 -lrb- 1530 gmt -rrb- i am writing this lying in a sleeping bag in the middle of the desert with a fleece over my head , having asked a colleague to make sure no light can be seen through the gaps .
it is 1900 and the royal marines 3 commando force has bedded down for the night .
surrounding us are pairs of highly armed if scantily-armoured patrol vehicles , with a .50 calibre machine gun on each pointing out from our small corral .
each vehicle will be manned all night long .
we are a few kilometres from a town that is still largely under the control of the taleban .
the force is tasked with roaming the desert for weeks on end , feeding back information to headquarters and fighting back if attacked .
the marines drove through the town to show their presence .
they expected to come under fire , but it remained quiet .
there were a few children playing , a few farmers ploughing their dusty fields and a few people driving camels to their own corral , the huge beasts hopping , their front feet bound together to stop them running away .
we headed back into the desert and grabbed our rations just before sunset - it was too late to light the small solid fuel stoves and heat up the meal in a bag - as we had to be in place well out of sight or sound of the town before it got dark .
but after a day being battered about in the back of a small patrol vehicle , open to the beating desert sun , any food hot or cold was welcome , as was the chocolate .
the bbc team had joined the patrol at camp bastion in helmand province at first light and the convoy bounced its way cross-country through mile after mile of barren desert .
they met up with the artillery gunners who provide support for the force as it stays constantly on the move , never staying overnight in the same place twice and always prepared to call for artillery support and for air power if needed .
the force we are with is a specialist unit used to these arduous conditions - and to the risk of ambush and attack .
this could prove to be a fascinating week .

the vote is scheduled for 24 november , and if the motion passes it will trigger a national referendum on whether to get rid of the president .
mr chen has survived two such votes before , and looks likely to again .
but this time the challenge will be tougher , in the light of prosecutors ' claims that they have enough evidence to charge him with corruption .
mr chen can not be prosecuted while in office , as he is protected by presidential immunity , but his wife , wu shu-chen , and three ex-aides have already been charged with the misuse of state funds .
opposition supporters are continuing their demands for mr chen to step down over the crisis .
keeping up the pressure the opposition parties , which have a small majority in parliament , will need at least 14 ruling party members to back the recall motion in order for it to succeed .
scandal timeline march 2004 : president chen narrowly wins re-election may 2006 : president 's son-in-law held over insider trading claims charged in july allegations of improper conduct involving chen 's wife and senior aides also surface june : chen cedes some powers to pm amid outcry unprecedented opposition motion to oust him , which fails september : two weeks of pro and anti-chen marches opposition launch new bid to recall chen , which again fails october : wu shu-chen cleared of accepting shop vouchers in return for influence november : wu shu-chen charged with corruption over handling of secret presidential funds prosecutors say enough evidence to indict chen , but he is protected by presidential immunity testing times for taiwan the last two attempts - in june and october - failed as all mr chen 's democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- colleagues stood by him .
analysts say the big question now is whether the prosecutors ' conclusions last friday will cause some dpp lawmakers to lose faith in their leader and vote in favour of the recall motion .
so far , correspondents say , it appears likely that the vote will again fail .

the vote is scheduled for 24 november , and if the motion passes it will trigger a national referendum on whether to get rid of the president .
mr chen has survived two such votes before , and looks likely to again .
but this time the challenge will be tougher , in the light of prosecutors ' claims that they have enough evidence to charge him with corruption .
mr chen can not be prosecuted while in office , as he is protected by presidential immunity , but his wife , wu shu-chen , and three ex-aides have already been charged with the misuse of state funds .
opposition supporters are continuing their demands for mr chen to step down over the crisis .

council tax payers in england and wales are shouldering too much and businesses should take on more of the burden , the local government association maintains .
it said free care for 370,000 elderly people could be dropped unless funding is boosted by 2009 .
the government described the claims as a tactic to secure additional funding .
the lga said there had been an " unprecedented " 50 % rise in local authority spending in england and wales since 1997 , with most of the money going on education .
the cost of waste disposal is set to more than double by 2013 because of european union landfill regulations , it added .

the government , meanwhile , has issued a white paper on proposals to give english councils more powers without whitehall approval .
" government must be honest and decide if it is serious about meeting the demographic , social , environmental and economic costs of the future , " said lga chairman lord bruce-lockhart .
" if it is , investing in local services is crucial and local government is ready to play its part .
if not , local councils and local taxpayers need to know , so they can prepare for the consequences . "
local government minister phil woolas said : " if local government wants to be a partner in governance and the delivery of services with national government , they have to talk the language of balanced books and not that of a pressure group .
