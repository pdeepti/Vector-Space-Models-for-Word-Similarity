program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2006 opinion : avoiding the issues in ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with turkish leaders thursday to discuss hot political and cultural topics , but both sides avoided the most contentious issues .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .
" i want to see the contracts and they need to be examined by our best lawyers , " he said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .

the dresden-based lawyer announced thursday that he 's in the compensation business , fighting for the victims of little green men . the german government has been accused of many things but not taking care of those citizens who have been abducted by aliens could be the strangest . help is at hand for anyone who feels they have been let down by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition in the form of entrepreneurial lawyer jens lorek who has seized upon this apparent niche in the compensation market .
lorek has made it known that he is the man to pursue your claim if you feel that the state is n't taking care of you post-abduction . abductees could get cash , therapy or drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " take me ... i could do with the money " lorek , a lawyer based in the eastern city of dresden who specializes in social and labor law , told reporters that people who experience unexplained time loss , discover unusual markings on their bodies and find themselves having flashbacks of procedures including anal probes should come to him .
he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .
this has effectively stopped it from legally existing . community effort close to saving hotel from nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schwettmann leads the citizens against the nazis mergel now has little leverage in the deal with his only real chance of getting to extra 400,000 euros he wants coming from an ebay sale , unless the neo-nazis can reform their company and make a concrete bid . the city and people of delmenhorst are hoping that does n't happen .
they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .
this has effectively stopped it from legally existing . community effort close to saving hotel from nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schwettmann leads the citizens against the nazis mergel now has little leverage in the deal with his only real chance of getting to extra 400,000 euros he wants coming from an ebay sale , unless the neo-nazis can reform their company and make a concrete bid . the city and people of delmenhorst are hoping that does n't happen .
they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .
liquids will have to fit into containers that are 100 ml or smaller . the commission said certain exceptions would be made for medicine , baby food and other dietary needs .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .
liquids will have to fit into containers that are 100 ml or smaller . the commission said certain exceptions would be made for medicine , baby food and other dietary needs .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .
liquids will have to fit into containers that are 100 ml or smaller . the commission said certain exceptions would be made for medicine , baby food and other dietary needs .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .
this has effectively stopped it from legally existing . community effort close to saving hotel from nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schwettmann leads the citizens against the nazis mergel now has little leverage in the deal with his only real chance of getting to extra 400,000 euros he wants coming from an ebay sale , unless the neo-nazis can reform their company and make a concrete bid . the city and people of delmenhorst are hoping that does n't happen .
they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .
" i want to see the contracts and they need to be examined by our best lawyers , " he said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .

he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .

it will likely not be ready until summer of 2008 . the giant database will link together information gathered by police in the bloc 's 25 member countries , and replace the current system , which is only effective for 18 nations .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .

it will likely not be ready until summer of 2008 . the giant database will link together information gathered by police in the bloc 's 25 member countries , and replace the current system , which is only effective for 18 nations .
sis ii would also be used to stock the new biometric data in use in travel documents , including fingerprints and computerized photographs . or political stalling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials want to do away with traffic jams along the german border but polish interior minister ludwik dorn did n't seem convinced the delay was purely of a technical nature . " there are people who are saying that there are technical problems , and there are others who are saying that it is political , " he said . portugal meanwhile has brought forward a compromise proposal that calls for an adaptation of the current system for new member states until sis ii is ready .
but while slovenia , slovakia and the czech republic were reportedly in favor of the proposal , poland said it could not afford this interim solution as well as the move to sis ii . the ministers are scheduled to decide in december how to proceed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says tough new swiss asylum laws " incompatible " the european commission has branded switzerland 's new stringent asylum laws as incompatible with eu standards , following the un 's lead in denouncing the result of sunday 's referendum .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.10.2006 study on university research funding sparks competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty top universities receive most of the third-party research funding a study released this week revealed which universities in germany receive the most funding for research and brought a bit of competition into a system that has long been based on equality . munich 's ludwig maximilians university and the technical college in aachen bring in the most third-party research funds in the country , the german research society -lrb- dfg -rrb- announced on wednesday . " competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .
the winners will receive 35 million euros in funding annually until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite detractors , germany pursues elite schools germany 's plan to overhaul its university system and create a cadre of elite universities is heating up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.10.2006 new blow for eads as austria prepares to end eurofighter deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the drawing board to the runway , the eurofighter has been dogged by problems in yet another blow to airbus parent company eads , austria 's newly elected center-left government has threatened to make good on one of its election promises and scrap the purchase of 18 eurofighters . before last sunday 's general election , the social democrats pledged to ditch the two billion euro -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- order put in place by the ruling conservative government of the time .
now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .
" i want to see the contracts and they need to be examined by our best lawyers , " he said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 06.10.2006 afghan duty becomes riskier for german troops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops are considering using more heavily armored vehicles violence in afghanistan as well as the possibility of having to take on more dangerous missions is threatening germany 's hopes of restoring normality in the country through a recipe of public safety and reconstruction . with 2,800 of its soldiers deployed in the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in kabul and northern afghanistan , germany has thus far refused to be drawn into isaf 's growing role of doing battle with the taliban in the south and southeast of the country . instead of engaging in military action , the germans have focused their work on public safety and reconstruction through the use of " provincial reconstruction teams " in the cities of kunduz and faizabad . german soldiers were assigned to foot patrols , trudging through the dusty streets of faizabad , chatting with the locals as planners remained anxious to avoid upsetting afghans with any overt displays of military force . ayesha khan , an associate fellow at the british think-tank chatham house , said the germans have been very successful in the areas where they have been engaged . foot patrols becoming more vulnerable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato took over command of all forces in afghanistan this week " they have maintained a peacekeeping role and did not engage in combat operations and the war on terror , " she said .
" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .

" they have clear rules of engagement about what the troops can do . " some of the gentle touch has now gone , amid concerns that foot-soldiers are too vulnerable to suicide attack .
berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .
berlin does not discuss its activities , but the us european command says one of the germans was nearly killed last year by an enemy bomb while on patrol . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense ministry admits german planes in action in afghanistan a defense ministry source has revealed that german military aircraft are seeing action in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .
the report comes days after german help in the south was officially ruled out .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .
liquids will have to fit into containers that are 100 ml or smaller . the commission said certain exceptions would be made for medicine , baby food and other dietary needs .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

old eu members say the newcomers have to secure their outside borders in the east before controls at the internal eu borders can be abolished . new states " have to meet the criteria , otherwise there is less and not more safety in europe , " schäuble said , responding to criticism that an opening of the borders to the east may be delayed until 2009 .
initially , border controls had been expected to disappear by october 2007 . computer delays ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting up the new system requires more time , officials say ministers on thursday were given a rough timetable for when the technical side of the new schengen information system -lrb- sis ii -rrb- , the prerequisite for opening borders , might be completed . the super computer was due to enter into use next april , but it has been delayed by technical difficulties , legal complaints by contractors and the sheer scale of setting up and testing it .
it will likely not be ready until summer of 2008 . the giant database will link together information gathered by police in the bloc 's 25 member countries , and replace the current system , which is only effective for 18 nations .
sis ii would also be used to stock the new biometric data in use in travel documents , including fingerprints and computerized photographs . or political stalling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials want to do away with traffic jams along the german border but polish interior minister ludwik dorn did n't seem convinced the delay was purely of a technical nature . " there are people who are saying that there are technical problems , and there are others who are saying that it is political , " he said . portugal meanwhile has brought forward a compromise proposal that calls for an adaptation of the current system for new member states until sis ii is ready .
but while slovenia , slovakia and the czech republic were reportedly in favor of the proposal , poland said it could not afford this interim solution as well as the move to sis ii . the ministers are scheduled to decide in december how to proceed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says tough new swiss asylum laws " incompatible " the european commission has branded switzerland 's new stringent asylum laws as incompatible with eu standards , following the un 's lead in denouncing the result of sunday 's referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2006 opinion : avoiding the issues in ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with turkish leaders thursday to discuss hot political and cultural topics , but both sides avoided the most contentious issues .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .

however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .

the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .

berlin has instructed the troops to use armored vehicles during forays outside their well-fortified camps . currently the troops use lighter armored personnel carriers on wheels , but commanders have requested that heavier marder infantry fighting vehicles -lrb- ifvs -rrb- be stockpiled at a new german base in mazar-i-sharif . " if isaf changes its role to counter-insurgency , it ca n't be engaged -lrb- in the same way -rrb- in peacekeeping , " khan said , describing the risk posed to troops . fear of losing support at home while german officers worry that their profile among the afghan public will suffer if they join in the war , chancellor angela merkel and defense minister franz josef jung are concerned public support in germany for the deployment may evaporate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : south and southeast afghanistan have proved more dangerous than the north at the end of september , the deployment won a fresh authorization until oct .
13 , 2007 from germany 's parliament . so far , germany has suffered 18 personnel killed in afghanistan , 12 of them in accidents .
major casualties , however , could lead to calls to bring the troops home and abandon afghanistan to its fate . the afghan deployment is the biggest of several german peacekeeping operations in the world .
until the 1990s , modern germany kept out of peacekeeping missions , but gradually accepted that it had to help , in line with its world diplomatic and economic influence . nato command could alter german deployment for part of 2003 , the germans were in charge of isaf and made up the largest single nationality in its ranks .
at that stage , isaf was mainly a peacekeeping force , leaving fighting to the american and british-led " operation enduring freedom . " isaf , under nato command , has become a different creature , blooded in major ground combat with the taliban in the south and having just officially absorbed 12,000 us troops thursday , growing to a total strength of 32,000 five years after the first bombs fell to drive out the taliban government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new response force could be deployed to any part of afghanistan currently the germans are keeping their distance from isaf 's new role by remaining in the relatively peaceful north . sources familiar with the defense ministry say there are now concerns that nato may draw german troops into the war through a new unit , the nato response force -lrb- nrf -rrb- , which will comprise 25,000 men in europe , trained to be deployable with just five days notice . germany is to provide up to 6,600 of the soldiers and nato supreme allied commander james jones hopes to declare it operable at the end of next month during the nato summit in the latvian capital riga . berlin wants to be sure that it will not be called to assist struggling nato forces in the south of afghanistan . the only german soldiers in afghanistan currently courting hostile contact are in a special-forces unit .
berlin does not discuss its activities , but the us european command says one of the germans was nearly killed last year by an enemy bomb while on patrol . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense ministry admits german planes in action in afghanistan a defense ministry source has revealed that german military aircraft are seeing action in the volatile southern region of afghanistan .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.10.2006 new blow for eads as austria prepares to end eurofighter deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the drawing board to the runway , the eurofighter has been dogged by problems in yet another blow to airbus parent company eads , austria 's newly elected center-left government has threatened to make good on one of its election promises and scrap the purchase of 18 eurofighters . before last sunday 's general election , the social democrats pledged to ditch the two billion euro -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- order put in place by the ruling conservative government of the time .
now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2006 opinion : avoiding the issues in ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with turkish leaders thursday to discuss hot political and cultural topics , but both sides avoided the most contentious issues .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eu warns turkey to step up reforms to avoid " train crash " turkey faces a " train crash " in its relations with the european union if it fails to step up democratic reforms and resolve a trade row with cyprus , eu enlargement chief olli rehn has said .

the dresden-based lawyer announced thursday that he 's in the compensation business , fighting for the victims of little green men . the german government has been accused of many things but not taking care of those citizens who have been abducted by aliens could be the strangest . help is at hand for anyone who feels they have been let down by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition in the form of entrepreneurial lawyer jens lorek who has seized upon this apparent niche in the compensation market .
lorek has made it known that he is the man to pursue your claim if you feel that the state is n't taking care of you post-abduction . abductees could get cash , therapy or drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " take me ... i could do with the money " lorek , a lawyer based in the eastern city of dresden who specializes in social and labor law , told reporters that people who experience unexplained time loss , discover unusual markings on their bodies and find themselves having flashbacks of procedures including anal probes should come to him .
he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .

" the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .

lorek has made it known that he is the man to pursue your claim if you feel that the state is n't taking care of you post-abduction . abductees could get cash , therapy or drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " take me ... i could do with the money " lorek , a lawyer based in the eastern city of dresden who specializes in social and labor law , told reporters that people who experience unexplained time loss , discover unusual markings on their bodies and find themselves having flashbacks of procedures including anal probes should come to him .
he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .
this has effectively stopped it from legally existing . community effort close to saving hotel from nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schwettmann leads the citizens against the nazis mergel now has little leverage in the deal with his only real chance of getting to extra 400,000 euros he wants coming from an ebay sale , unless the neo-nazis can reform their company and make a concrete bid . the city and people of delmenhorst are hoping that does n't happen .
they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time .

now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .

export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .

" we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .

the dresden-based lawyer announced thursday that he 's in the compensation business , fighting for the victims of little green men . the german government has been accused of many things but not taking care of those citizens who have been abducted by aliens could be the strangest . help is at hand for anyone who feels they have been let down by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition in the form of entrepreneurial lawyer jens lorek who has seized upon this apparent niche in the compensation market .

he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2006 opinion : avoiding the issues in ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with turkish leaders thursday to discuss hot political and cultural topics , but both sides avoided the most contentious issues .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eu warns turkey to step up reforms to avoid " train crash " turkey faces a " train crash " in its relations with the european union if it fails to step up democratic reforms and resolve a trade row with cyprus , eu enlargement chief olli rehn has said .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .
this has effectively stopped it from legally existing . community effort close to saving hotel from nazis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schwettmann leads the citizens against the nazis mergel now has little leverage in the deal with his only real chance of getting to extra 400,000 euros he wants coming from an ebay sale , unless the neo-nazis can reform their company and make a concrete bid . the city and people of delmenhorst are hoping that does n't happen .
they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

the dresden-based lawyer announced thursday that he 's in the compensation business , fighting for the victims of little green men . the german government has been accused of many things but not taking care of those citizens who have been abducted by aliens could be the strangest . help is at hand for anyone who feels they have been let down by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition in the form of entrepreneurial lawyer jens lorek who has seized upon this apparent niche in the compensation market .
lorek has made it known that he is the man to pursue your claim if you feel that the state is n't taking care of you post-abduction . abductees could get cash , therapy or drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " take me ... i could do with the money " lorek , a lawyer based in the eastern city of dresden who specializes in social and labor law , told reporters that people who experience unexplained time loss , discover unusual markings on their bodies and find themselves having flashbacks of procedures including anal probes should come to him .
he would then attempt to win state compensation cases on their behalf . " there 's quite obviously demand for legal advice here , " lorek said thursday .
" the trouble is , people are afraid of making fools of themselves in court . " citing statistics that state that scores of alien assaults are reported in germany every year , lorek said that abductees could stand to win major remuneration or other benefits from the german government .
" these people could appeal for therapies or cures , " he said . lorek had yet to win any abduction claims at the time of publication . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's latest conspiracy theory it could be a university prank or a case for mulder and scully : students from the university of kiel have claimed in their own x-file that the german city of bielefeld does n't actually exist .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.10.2006 new blow for eads as austria prepares to end eurofighter deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the drawing board to the runway , the eurofighter has been dogged by problems in yet another blow to airbus parent company eads , austria 's newly elected center-left government has threatened to make good on one of its election promises and scrap the purchase of 18 eurofighters . before last sunday 's general election , the social democrats pledged to ditch the two billion euro -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- order put in place by the ruling conservative government of the time .
now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .

the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 06.10.2006 opinion : avoiding the issues in ankara großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel met with turkish leaders thursday to discuss hot political and cultural topics , but both sides avoided the most contentious issues .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .
in an interview with dw-world.de , us-based expert soner cagaptay stressed that turkey is part of europe .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eu warns turkey to step up reforms to avoid " train crash " turkey faces a " train crash " in its relations with the european union if it fails to step up democratic reforms and resolve a trade row with cyprus , eu enlargement chief olli rehn has said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.10.2006 study on university research funding sparks competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty top universities receive most of the third-party research funding a study released this week revealed which universities in germany receive the most funding for research and brought a bit of competition into a system that has long been based on equality . munich 's ludwig maximilians university and the technical college in aachen bring in the most third-party research funds in the country , the german research society -lrb- dfg -rrb- announced on wednesday . " competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .
the winners will receive 35 million euros in funding annually until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite detractors , germany pursues elite schools germany 's plan to overhaul its university system and create a cadre of elite universities is heating up .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .

old eu members say the newcomers have to secure their outside borders in the east before controls at the internal eu borders can be abolished . new states " have to meet the criteria , otherwise there is less and not more safety in europe , " schäuble said , responding to criticism that an opening of the borders to the east may be delayed until 2009 .
initially , border controls had been expected to disappear by october 2007 . computer delays ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting up the new system requires more time , officials say ministers on thursday were given a rough timetable for when the technical side of the new schengen information system -lrb- sis ii -rrb- , the prerequisite for opening borders , might be completed . the super computer was due to enter into use next april , but it has been delayed by technical difficulties , legal complaints by contractors and the sheer scale of setting up and testing it .
it will likely not be ready until summer of 2008 . the giant database will link together information gathered by police in the bloc 's 25 member countries , and replace the current system , which is only effective for 18 nations .
sis ii would also be used to stock the new biometric data in use in travel documents , including fingerprints and computerized photographs . or political stalling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials want to do away with traffic jams along the german border but polish interior minister ludwik dorn did n't seem convinced the delay was purely of a technical nature . " there are people who are saying that there are technical problems , and there are others who are saying that it is political , " he said . portugal meanwhile has brought forward a compromise proposal that calls for an adaptation of the current system for new member states until sis ii is ready .
but while slovenia , slovakia and the czech republic were reportedly in favor of the proposal , poland said it could not afford this interim solution as well as the move to sis ii . the ministers are scheduled to decide in december how to proceed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says tough new swiss asylum laws " incompatible " the european commission has branded switzerland 's new stringent asylum laws as incompatible with eu standards , following the un 's lead in denouncing the result of sunday 's referendum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.10.2006 study on university research funding sparks competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty top universities receive most of the third-party research funding a study released this week revealed which universities in germany receive the most funding for research and brought a bit of competition into a system that has long been based on equality . munich 's ludwig maximilians university and the technical college in aachen bring in the most third-party research funds in the country , the german research society -lrb- dfg -rrb- announced on wednesday . " competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .
the winners will receive 35 million euros in funding annually until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite detractors , germany pursues elite schools germany 's plan to overhaul its university system and create a cadre of elite universities is heating up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 06.10.2006 study on university research funding sparks competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forty top universities receive most of the third-party research funding a study released this week revealed which universities in germany receive the most funding for research and brought a bit of competition into a system that has long been based on equality . munich 's ludwig maximilians university and the technical college in aachen bring in the most third-party research funds in the country , the german research society -lrb- dfg -rrb- announced on wednesday . " competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management . " the data gives us information about the status of top research in germany , the structural aspects of research funding and which fields are emphasized by individual research institutions and regions , " güdler said .
" our study is also an innovative contribution to the discussion on university profile building . " on oct .
13 , germany 's " elite universities " will be announced as part of an effort to improve the reputation of higher education in the country .
the winners will receive 35 million euros in funding annually until 2011 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de despite detractors , germany pursues elite schools germany 's plan to overhaul its university system and create a cadre of elite universities is heating up .

but that 's easier said than done . a huge poster of an old woman with sparkling eyes and snowy white hair adorns the entrance to the hall featuring india , the guest of honor , at the frankfurt book fair .
the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

it said limits on the size of carry-on bags would go into force in six months . the new security rules are expected to come into force in early november and would allow passengers to carry on small toiletry items , such as toothpaste , contact lens solution and perfume .
passengers will be permitted to take on board one re-sealable plastic bag of a maximum size of 1 liter -lrb- 34 ounces -rrb- in which liquid items can be placed .
liquids will have to fit into containers that are 100 ml or smaller . the commission said certain exceptions would be made for medicine , baby food and other dietary needs .

" it will apply to all departing flights in order to protect people everywhere in the -lrb- eu -rrb- , " he added . barrot said the standards were sufficient for flights to the united states . hand luggage size restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luggage is x-rayed before being loaded on planes size limits for carry-on bags are also expected to go into effect into force in six months .
carry-on bags are to be limited to 56 cm -lrb- 22 inches -rrb- by 45 cm -lrb- 18 inches -rrb- by 25 cm . exemptions on the size of carry-on luggage will be made for items such as musical instruments and cameras . security measures have been stepped up after british authorities said they had foiled a plot in london in august to bomb flights bound for the united states using liquid explosives . the united states has welcomed the new security restrictions , which were proposed last week by experts from eu member states to unify security measures across the 25-nation bloc . the us transportation security administration said that experts from europe , canada and the us have shared the results of comprehensive explosives testing to gain a better understanding of the threat since the ban on liquids was initially installed on august 10 .

while the hotel 's owner rejected the bid , the city is still confident of success . in a bid to save the hotel am stadtpark from the clutches of a neo-nazi organization represented by far-right lawyer jürgen rieger , the town of delmenhorst have upped its bid for the hotel to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 3.8 million -rrb- .
the council met late of thursday evening and agreed on the price by a majority vote .
the offer , the council stated , would be its final one . however , with the hotel still available on the internet auction site ebay for 3.4 million euros - the price the extremist wilhelm tietjen foundation for fertilization ltd offered in september before falling silent on the deal - hotelier günter mergel seems to be holding out for a higher offer than the council is willing to meet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger lowered an initial bid of 3.4 million euros for the hotel the owner of the hotel am stadtpark told the council he would not sell at their price , stating tax reasons for wanting a higher fee . hotel burdened in debt a spokesperson for the delmenhorst council said the representatives were unimpressed with mergel 's stance but were confident of buying the hotel at their suggested price . the hotel has been empty for the past 15 months and mergel has been keen to cut his losses , to such an extent that he was willing to give the hotel to the neo-nazi group as a donation in return for the tietjen foundation taking over his considerable debts on the property . since initially offering 3.4 million euros for the hotel early last month , which the foundation wanted to turn into a far-right training and conference center , lawyer rieger has gone underground and the foundation has been scratched from the british business register due to non-payment of taxes .

they hope their combined offer - made up of 1.6 million euros from the town coffers , 920,000 euros raised by the concerned townsfolk and 500,000 euros in building society loans - will be the only offer on the table and the one günter mergel accepts out of desperation to sell . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de neo-nazis nowhere in sight as hotel purchase deadline nears the mysterious neo-nazi foundation behind the proposed purchase of a hotel in the german town of delmenhorst no longer exists , according to british sources .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .
for merkel to be seen to be supporting turkey would help in the problems integrating turks in germany , while turkey could call on its historical experiences to offer her advice in creating a dialogue between cultures and religions . merkel 's trip to turkey was the first by a christian democratic chancellor since helmut kohl visited 13 years ago , and she arrived at an unstable time for the country .
turkey is struggling with the problems surrounding secularism , the dangers of fundamentalism and the divide over whether to join the european union . during her 26-hour visit , merkel was restricted in who she met with in ankara and istanbul .
there were no representatives from civil society groups or women 's organizations to offer information or criticism of turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , although she did get to meet with different religious representatives . during the festival to mark the end of ramadan , organized by the istanbul faction of erdogan 's justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , the german contingent had limited access to president ahmet necdet sezer .
however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- " admitting turkey will be a test of how secular the eu is " chancellor angela merkel , who opposes eu membership for turkey , will pay her first state visit to ankara thursday .

however , during their short discussion , sezer criticized the leader of erdogan 's eu accession negotiation team , ali babacan , and rubbished the image of turkey as a modern , secularized republic . those who support erdogan - but by no means the majority of people living in the land on the bosporus - have turned away from the contemporary western lifestyle and pluralistic democracy .
it is no secret that erdogan has his eye on the candidacy when parliament chooses a new president next april , and there 's also the possibility that a female turk in a headscarf could become the first lady . the bones of contention over cyprus were carefully laid on the table during discussions .
erdogan confirmed that turkey would continue not to recognize eu member cyprus until customs rules on the turkish north of the mediterranean island are relaxed .
a solution to the cyprus problem which is satisfactory to both sides would ease one of the major headaches facing germany as it prepares to take over the rotating eu presidency on january 1 . but despite some dialogue , there was little said on important subjects like the role of women in the state and society or the support of the integration process of turks in germany . baha güngör is the head of dw-radio 's turkish department and an expert on turkish affairs . baha güngör -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : turkey 's eu bid hinges on resolving cyprus issue visiting turkey for the first time as chancellor , angela merkel thursday said that the country must meet its obligation to grant cyprus trade privileges if it wants to avoid jeopardizing eu membership talks .

deutsche welle 's baha güngör comments on the outcomes of merkel 's visit . angela merkel 's toned down stance on turkey as federal chancellor is a logical consequence of her taking over the responsibility of leadership . on her first trip to turkey as head of the german government , merkel decided not to pursue her previous course of pushing for a privileged partnership over full eu membership and , indeed , left the topic of eu entry off her agenda . in fact , a day before her arrival , sigmar gabriel , merkel 's social democratic environment minister , told ankara that the nato state of turkey was integral for the future peace and stability of europe . despite this groundwork and diplomacy , merkel did say that turkey 's slow progress towards eu membership would have the support of germany as long as the country continued to develop in line with european standards . and so the struggle for transparency in germany 's turkey policy goes on .
one must not forget that merkel is the leader of the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , a party largely critical of turkey and one which is twinned with the even more critical christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the cdu 's bavarian sister party which is categorically against turkey joining the eu .
more and more leading conservative politicians are joining those who call for a suspension , if not an outright end , to accession negotiations with turkey . on the other hand , merkel is the head of the government and she has the power to decide whether to put party interests aside in favor of political foresight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.10.2006 new blow for eads as austria prepares to end eurofighter deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from the drawing board to the runway , the eurofighter has been dogged by problems in yet another blow to airbus parent company eads , austria 's newly elected center-left government has threatened to make good on one of its election promises and scrap the purchase of 18 eurofighters . before last sunday 's general election , the social democrats pledged to ditch the two billion euro -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- order put in place by the ruling conservative government of the time .
now preparing for government , the social democrats look set to deal eads another huge blow by tabling a motion in favor of binning the contract as promised as soon as the new parliament convenes . with civilian aircraft subsidiary airbus lurching from one crisis to another , news that the eurofighter aircraft project has taken another hit will surely increase the tension at eads . the eurofighter is built by three companies , bae systems in britain , eads in germany and spain and alenia in italy under a work sharing arrangement which reflects the number of aircraft being bought by the partner countries .
the project has been dogged by problems from its inception but recently the most pressing has been in regard to orders and delivery . while saudi arabia continues to make positive noises about its order of 72 planes , none have yet been purchased , while south korea and singapore have both pulled out of talks after originally appearing keen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potential clients remain unconvinced greece , which has an order for 60 aircraft , is also wavering and is reviewing its order due to financial constraints .
other countries tipped as possible buyers include india , pakistan , turkey , norway and denmark . austria decision could have domino effect if austria goes ahead and pulls out of its deal as promised it will be a huge slap in the face which may have serious implications . countries debating orders may be put off by the lack of faith shown by the austrians and a domino effect of nations pulling out could critically damage the project 's already fragile reputation and throw its future into doubt .
export orders are seen as crucial because of their contribution to the overall profitability of the program . austria 's participation in the project was controversial from the start as the small country was pushed into the deal by the outgoing conservative government of wolfgang schüssel despite being militarily neutral .
the former government was going to spend up to 6 billion euros in total on eurofighters over the next 20 years . parliament to rule on " unbelievably expensive " order bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new chancellor gusenbauer looks set to quit the deal however , now it looks as though the new social democratic chancellor , alfred gusenbauer , could signal the end of the deal as early as the end of october when the new parliament meets for the first time . " a committee of inquiry should clarify the political responsibility for the senseless procurement of this unbelievably expensive war machine , " josef cap , the social democrats ' floor leader , told vienna 's der standard newspaper . " we do n't need the eurofighter .
it is not an ideological , but a financial issue .
i 've got nothing against these planes as such .
but they cost an awful lot of money .
i always believed that there were much better things to be done with that money . " partners prepare to fight austria over deal but the reneging on the deal by austria may not be as simple as just saying that it no longer wants the planes .
the first four planes on order are already under construction in germany , and it is unlikely that the companies involved in the eurofighter 's manufacture will let austria off the hook so easily . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two of austria 's eurofighters are nearly ready a spokesperson for bae systems said thursday that the companies building the eurofighter were " under contract with austria .
we are delivering against that contract .
the first aircraft are in production . " with his country facing the possibility of a legal challenge and demands for compensation chancellor-in-waiting gusenbauer is taking no chances .
" i want to see the contracts and they need to be examined by our best lawyers , " he said earlier this week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad to worse for airbus as a380 crisis effects other projects if things were n't bad enough already , airbus announced thursday that the problems that forced the delayed roll-out of the a380 superjumbo may effect at least two other projects and set the company back at least a decade .
-lrb- 05.10.2006 -rrb- german government urged to intervene in airbus crisis plans to move airbus operations out of germany as part of a cost-cutting plan have angered politicians and officials who are calling on the german government to intervene in a bid to retain investment in the firm .
-lrb- 04.10.2006 -rrb- eads announces billion-euro losses eads , the parent company of the troubled airbus concern , said on tuesday delays in the production of the a380 super-jumbo would lead to a cumulative operating loss of 2.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- until 2010 .

feel the government let you down ?
call jens lorek .
the dresden-based lawyer announced thursday that he 's in the compensation business , fighting for the victims of little green men . the german government has been accused of many things but not taking care of those citizens who have been abducted by aliens could be the strangest . help is at hand for anyone who feels they have been let down by chancellor angela merkel 's coalition in the form of entrepreneurial lawyer jens lorek who has seized upon this apparent niche in the compensation market .
lorek has made it known that he is the man to pursue your claim if you feel that the state is n't taking care of you post-abduction . abductees could get cash , therapy or drugs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " take me ... i could do with the money " lorek , a lawyer based in the eastern city of dresden who specializes in social and labor law , told reporters that people who experience unexplained time loss , discover unusual markings on their bodies and find themselves having flashbacks of procedures including anal probes should come to him .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management .

" competition is the best means to more competence in the academic system - when there 's a winner and a loser .
then everyone will try to improve , " said arend oetker , president of the association for german academics , the organization that financed the study . to introduce a bit of competition , germany is on the process of revamping its system of higher education to include internationally recognized bachelor and master degrees and a collection of so-called " elite universities . "
traditionally , german higher education institutions have been governed by an unspoken code of equality , even if differences do exist in practice . the dfg study , which covered the period 2002 to 2004 , focused on funding at the nation 's top 40 research universities .
third-party funding is money that comes not from the state or federal budgets for universities , but from government ministries , eu research programs , foundations , or the dfg itself . the dfg is the country 's largest distributor of public research funds .
it administers about 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.27 billion -rrb- per year . few universities receive majority of funds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of research funding goes to the medical field a total of 3.2 billion euros went to research at universities between 2002 and 2004 , according to the study .
of that , the ludwig maximilians university in munich received 131 million euros and the technical college in aachen 126 million .
the two institutions have been competing for the top spot since the study was first conducted in 1997 . there was a tie for third place , with the universities of heidelberg and würzburg each receiving 105 million euros . " the 10 most successful universities received nearly a third of the funds , and the 40 best universities came away with 86 percent , " said dfg president ernst-ludwig winnacker .
" smaller universities or those that specialize in specific fields automatically do n't fare well in this kind of overall comparison - but that does n't say anything about the research done there . " but it was a small university - the technical college in karlsruhe - that had the highest funding per instructor at 407,000 euros . funding varies by field size is not the only caveat to the study 's results .
they are also dependent on the particular fields emphasized at each university , as some areas are more cost intensive than others . over all , the majority of the funding went to medical research -lrb- 2.6 billion euros -rrb- , then to technical fields of engineering , materials science and technology -lrb- 1.2 billion euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : universities - not just their students - want to make the grade engineering professors received an average of 1.1 million euros each for research purposes because they often need expensive tools .
humanities professors , whose research funding mainly covers " think time , " only came away with 107,000 euros each over the three-year period . university profile building the study is useful for more than just number crunching , said jürgen güdler , dfg 's director of information management .

the 80-year-old grand dame of indian literature , mahasweta devi , is a prolific author and champion of the marginalized .
mahasweta writes not in english , but in bengali - and as such is the perfect embodiment of india 's attempts to promote the massive body of literature produced in the country 's 23 official languages -lrb- not including english -rrb- at the book fair .
shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional . " sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " i wish indian writing in english were less triumphant " ahead of the frankfurt book fair , dw-world.de spoke with indian author amit chaudhuri about the west 's love affair with indian writing and the roles of english and literature in a multilingual , globalizing country .

shashi tharoor rather than shafi who ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amit chaudhuri , who writes in english , draws large crowds that 's no easy task as was apparent this week at the fair when there was standing room only as amit chaudhuri and shashi tharoor , both internationally acclaimed indian authors who write in english , took to the stage .
in contrast , only a handful turned up a few halls away to listen to shafi shauq , one of the most important contemporary poets and critics from northern indian kashmir , who writes in his native kashmiri . many people trickled away as shauq , whose book of poetry " remembering the skies " was translated into german this year , began to read a searing poem in his mother tongue about a victim of a gang rape in conflict-riddled kashmir . " indian literature is still largely seen as the literature of authors who write in english .
regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .

old eu members say the newcomers have to secure their outside borders in the east before controls at the internal eu borders can be abolished . new states " have to meet the criteria , otherwise there is less and not more safety in europe , " schäuble said , responding to criticism that an opening of the borders to the east may be delayed until 2009 .
initially , border controls had been expected to disappear by october 2007 . computer delays ... bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : setting up the new system requires more time , officials say ministers on thursday were given a rough timetable for when the technical side of the new schengen information system -lrb- sis ii -rrb- , the prerequisite for opening borders , might be completed . the super computer was due to enter into use next april , but it has been delayed by technical difficulties , legal complaints by contractors and the sheer scale of setting up and testing it .
it will likely not be ready until summer of 2008 . the giant database will link together information gathered by police in the bloc 's 25 member countries , and replace the current system , which is only effective for 18 nations .
sis ii would also be used to stock the new biometric data in use in travel documents , including fingerprints and computerized photographs . or political stalling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials want to do away with traffic jams along the german border but polish interior minister ludwik dorn did n't seem convinced the delay was purely of a technical nature . " there are people who are saying that there are technical problems , and there are others who are saying that it is political , " he said . portugal meanwhile has brought forward a compromise proposal that calls for an adaptation of the current system for new member states until sis ii is ready .
but while slovenia , slovakia and the czech republic were reportedly in favor of the proposal , poland said it could not afford this interim solution as well as the move to sis ii . the ministers are scheduled to decide in december how to proceed . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu says tough new swiss asylum laws " incompatible " the european commission has branded switzerland 's new stringent asylum laws as incompatible with eu standards , following the un 's lead in denouncing the result of sunday 's referendum .

regional literature hardly makes a dent in the west 's consciousness even though it 's such a diverse scene , " said peter ripkin , head of the frankfurt-based society for the promotion of asian , african and latin american literature . lost in translation the problem is n't exactly new .
two decades ago when india was the guest of honor at the frankfurt book fair , organizers paid much lip service to promoting regional literature .
but since then just about 40 titles have been translated from indian languages into german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shafi shauq is not well known outside indian kashmir things have improved this time around .
among the 55 indian works of fiction translated into german for the 2006 book fair , 14 were from regional languages .
in addition , the nearly 40-strong official delegation of indian authors in frankfurt includes more than 25 from languages such as punjabi , hindi , marathi , malayalam , assamese , urdu and others . to a large extent , a lack of good translators is to blame for the fact that indian regional literature remains virtually unknown in the west , say experts . very often works in languages such as tamil or oriya are first translated into english and then into german , thus losing much of the original feel and sense of the writing . " we do have a strong tradition of indology at german universities , but they all focus on producing scholars not translators , " said ripkin . " you have to have a writer 's feeling for the language to be able to translate literature and that ’ s something that needs to be consciously taught and promoted , " he added . playing it safe increasing awareness of regional indian authors is also made difficult by the fact that most major german publishing houses are reluctant to sign on writers in non-english languages . " most big publishers prefer to take safe bets on indian writers in english , " said ripkin . the only exception this autumn is the prestigious suhrkamp publishing company which bought the german rights to calcutta-based alka saraogi ’ s hindi novel " kali katha : waya baipas , " a story of an old man who wanders the streets of calcutta after a bypass surgery and conveys the sense of india caught between colonial and postcolonial history . a one-sided view of india ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large regions of india are still inaccessable to a majority of the west christian weiss , who heads the tiny heidelberg-based draupadi publishing company – one of the few in germany which consistently publishes indian writers in regional languages since its inception three years ago – also blames what he calls " plain levels of ignorance " in germany . sitting at his stand at the crowded book fair this week , weiss said the german media had hardly reviewed works in indian regional languages in the build up to the fair . " for instance the highly-respected german newspaper die zeit produced a 100-page thick frankfurt book fair supplement , but they exclusively featured indian writers in english , " he said .
" that ’ s a completely one-sided face of indian literature today . " tied up in tongues but it 's not just the western reception of indian literature that remains problematic .
much of the blame can be pinned on india too . as the popularity of indian authors writing in english soars on the sub-continent , regional literature has a tough time making itself heard and read .
though only a relatively small percentage of india 's 1.1 billion people can read and speak english , that number is spread across the country as opposed to regional languages that are geographically limited . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiran nagarkar writes in both english and marathi bombay-based author kiran nagarkar , who has received strong praise in germany for his new novel in english " god ’ s little soldier " about religious extremism , invited the wrath of critics in india when he wrote the book " ravan & eddie " in english after previously producing a literary masterpiece in his native marathi . however , " ravan & eddie " became a huge success and helped to popularize nagarkar in other parts of the country too . giving a voice to the oppressed experts agree that the importance of indian regional literature can hardly be overstated given its emphasis on rural life and social structures far removed from the growing urban centers .
it gives a voice to the marginalized and oppressed in a country focused on globalization . " dalit -lrb- the lowest caste in the hindu hierarchical social structure -rrb- literature and women 's writing are two of the most important literary movements emerging from indian regional writing , " said weiss . at the same time , the question remains whether such writing can be accessed by western readers . " of course indo-english writing that often deals with characters who move between the west and india will probably be something germans readers can identify with as opposed to stories of village life and of exploitation and feudal structures , " said weiss . " but the image of india has changed so dramatically over the years that i think people are beginning to take it very seriously and that applies to its literature too - both english and regional .

the suggested changes come just a month after the death of king taufa 'ahau tupou iv , who reigned for 41 years .
king tupou iv was against the idea of reforms - and while he was widely respected , he was seen as becoming increasingly autocratic in later years .
his son and heir , siaosi tupou v , is thought to be more in favour of change .
a statement from the royal palace last week reportedly said he would " hasten appropriate changes to the system of government , in response to the democratic wishes of the people " .
' by the people , for the people ' the chairman of the national committee for political reform , sitiveni halapua , said on thursday that the country 's laws should be changed to establish a " fully elected parliament , by the people , for the people " .
the committee is recommending that all 32 members of tonga 's legislature should be elected by the public .
currently the tongan people only elect nine lawmakers .
another nine are selected by nobles and the rest are appointed by the king .
in its report , the committee acknowledged that the majority of tongans respected the monarchy and wanted tongan traditions to remain intact .
but it said " there must be changes to the structure of government and how government is administered " .

photography marc abrahams , editor of science humour magazine annals of improbable research , which co-sponsors the awards , said : " the prizes are intended to celebrate the unusual , honour the imaginative - and spur people 's interest in science , medicine and technology . "
real-life nobel laureates demonstrated winning research the winners are given a one-minute acceptance speech , the time policed by a loud eight-year-old girl .
this year 's winners included : maths : how many photos must be taken to almost ensure no-one in a group shot has their eyes closed , by nic svenson and piers barnes ornithology : why woodpeckers do not get headaches , by ivan schwab and the late philip ra may nutrition : why dung beetles are fussy eaters , by wasmia al-houty and faten al-mussalam acoustics : why the sound of fingernails scraping on blackboards is so annoying , by d lynn halpern , randolph blake and james hillenbrand medicine : the termination of intractable hiccups with digital rectal massage , by francis fesmire , majed odeh , harry bassan and arie oliven .

hywel griffith health correspondent are patients better off on the welsh or english sides of the border ?
in 1999 politicians were prepared to abseil down hospital buildings to prove their commitment to the nhs .
after descending a 130ft wall in cardiff , alun michael promised labour would invest and reform if they won the first welsh assembly elections .
once elected , mr michael lasted less than a year as leader of the assembly government , but what about his promises to improve the welsh health service ?
so seven years on , who got the best deal from devolution : england or wales ?
there are the same sort of problems here working in an environment near major cities with the same social problems as when i worked in the valleys of south wales dr sioned williams , derbyshire it all comes down to how you judge the performance of the nhs .
a quick look at hospital waiting times would at first suggest england is streets ahead .
the current target time for a first outpatient appointment for an english patient is 13 weeks .
in wales , the same target is eight months .
access to care is high on the list of priorities for catrin macdonnell , who is originally from aberystwyth , and now lives in bristol with her husband simon and two young children .
" we have a new nhs walk-in centre , " catrin explains .
" on a sunday , for example , if your child has a rash you can just go down there .
you do n't see a gp but you do see a nurse . "
" that 's been a really , really good thing in bristol . "
nhs walk-in centres have not been introduced in wales , with the money spent on other projects , such as the introduction of free prescriptions by april 2007 .
living beyond budget feet on the ground : alun michael promised to support the nhs how money is spent is a key point in the comparison .
despite historic levels of investment , the nhs in both nations is living beyond its budget .
last year nhs deficits in england reached £ 512m , while in wales there was a £ 24m overspend .
but the strain has shown more in english hospitals , with 9,000 job cuts being announced this year .
redundancies have not followed in wales .
dr sioned williams has experience of the nhs on both sides of the border , and is currently based in kegworth , derbyshire .
" there are the same sort of problems here , " explained dr williams , " working in an environment near major cities with the same social problems as when i worked in the valleys of south wales . "
she felt the experience for patients within england was also variable .
" you hear about the postcode lottery and that 's not going to change overnight . "
different solutions whatever the problems , there are clear differences of approach .
in england , the use of private finance is far more widespread to build new hospitals , but it has led to some disquiet .
" unfortunately people are finding if you bring in a company whose main aim in life is to make money , " said dr dominique thompson from bristol , " then secondary to that is going to be healthcare and we 're seeing that with these new property developments . "
the new health centre at which she works opened last year , having been built using private finance .
it has meant a state of the art facility , but there are concerns .
" the interest rates on loans are going to be much more than people expected , " said dr thompson .
" that 's going to cause long term problems for the trust . "
the jury , then , is still out on who had the better deal with devolution .

hywel griffith health correspondent in 1999 politicians were prepared to abseil down hospital buildings to prove their commitment to the nhs .
after descending a 130ft wall in cardiff , alun michael promised labour would invest and reform if they won the first welsh assembly elections .
once elected , mr michael lasted less than a year as leader of the assembly government , but what about his promises to improve the welsh health service ?
so seven years on , who got the best deal from devolution : england or wales ? "
there are the same sort of problems here working in an environment near major cities with the same social problems as when i worked in the valleys of south wales " dr sioned williams , derbyshire it all comes down to how you judge the performance of the nhs .
a quick look at hospital waiting times would at first suggest england is streets ahead .
the current target time for a first outpatient appointment for an english patient is 13 weeks .
in wales , the same target is eight months .
access to care is high on the list of priorities for catrin macdonnell , who is originally from aberystwyth , and now lives in bristol with her husband simon and two young children .
" we have a new nhs walk-in centre , " catrin explains .
" on a sunday , for example , if your child has a rash you can just go down there .
you do n't see a gp but you do see a nurse . "
" that 's been a really , really good thing in bristol . "
nhs walk-in centres have not been introduced in wales , with the money spent on other projects , such as the introduction of free prescriptions by april 2007 .
living beyond budget how money is spent is a key point in the comparison .
despite historic levels of investment , the nhs in both nations is living beyond its budget .
last year nhs deficits in england reached £ 512m , while in wales there was a £ 24m overspend .
but the strain has shown more in english hospitals , with 9,000 job cuts being announced this year .
redundancies have not followed in wales .

ryanair has now amassed a 19.2 % stake in the firm , having said it held 16 % when it launched the offer on thursday .
aer lingus has spurned the offer saying it " significantly undervalues the group 's businesses and attractive long-term growth potential " .

the takeover approach by ryanair comes less than a week after aer lingus was privatised , with shares trading in dublin and london .
ryanair is offering 2.80 euros per share for the shares it does not own - 27 % more than the flotation price .

" it is entirely responsible for this debacle and must act now , while the situation is retrievable . "
' right decision ' but irish transport minister martin cullen insisted privatisation - which was carried out to raise funds for investment - had been the correct move .
" there 's no question that the decision the government took is still the right decision , " mr cullen said .
the irish government owns 28.3 % of aer lingus and insists it will not sell its shares - though ryanair has said it would be happy to go ahead with the government maintaining its stake .
according to the irish times , the government is considering mounting a legal challenge to the bid on competition grounds - referring it to the competition authority in dublin .
a takeover would almost certainly be referred to the european competition regulators because a merged group would have a 78 % share of the london to dublin route .

if the bid was successful , he said the plan was to continue to operate the two airlines separately and compete on the 17 routes which both use .
however , some analysts say that it is inevitable that at least some parts of aer lingus will be run on the ryanair model , and that there will be job cuts .

david bower , who played hugh grant 's deaf brother in four weddings and a funeral , went back to wrexham to try and persuade people to learn to sign .
he said hearing people could benefit hugely from learning the skill .
" as a deaf person i have experienced isolation , and i understand why many deaf people do , " said the actor , adding he refused to be isolated himself .
since appearing in the hit 1994 film , he has helped form a performance company called signdance collective , which produces theatre shows for both deaf and hearing people .
the group has visited wrexham as part of learn to sign week , and on friday was meeting pupils from the actor 's old school , borras park , which runs a deaf unit .
the team have been persuading hearing people to take up sign language .

maths coursework will be scrapped next september and " controlled assessments " in other gcses will follow .
ms davidson said the changes would help eliminate plagiarism but would still allow pupils ' independent study .
" the key aspect is we must have public confidence in the system , " said ms davidson .
under the changes , which will be " gently introduced " by 2009 , coursework in subjects including english literature and geography will be replaced by assessments done under teacher supervision .
there are no plans , however , to rule out practical assessments in subjects such as art and design , design and technology , home economics , music and pe , although these subjects will also have " stronger safeguards " .
gcse changes : coursework will be replaced by controlled assessments in : business studies classical subjects economics english literature geography history modern foreign languages religious studies social sciences decisions for welsh as a first and second language and welsh literature are yet to be announced .
the changes , which are also being introduced for pupils in england , were first revealed last week .
ms davidson said they wanted the work to be done in a " fairer setting where teachers and pupils can both have confidence . "
" it 's not just about plagiarism , " she said .
" it 's also about whether or not coursework which was designed 20 years ago is fit for purpose . "
" while people can gnaw away at the edges and the curriculum authorities do n't respond adequately , that contributes to reducing public confidence .
" i feel strongly as minister i want to make sure that every child out there who takes an examination knows that the public feels that the value of the examination is appropriate . "
level playing field the changes do not require legislation and from 2009 all gcse awarding bodies will be setting coursework where appropriate under the new arrangements , ms davidson added .
steve marshall , head teacher of st julian 's comprehensive in newport , said he " very much favoured " the announcement .
" we think it 's sensible and we 're very pleased that it brings wales into line with england and northern ireland , " said mr marshall , who is also a member of the association of school and college leaders executive in wales .
mr marshall also said wales needed an examination system in which the public felt confidence .
" this will end up with us having a system which the people outside schools can be truly confident in .
it 's going to be a level playing field for our pupils and students , " he added .
in the past , teaching unions have generally been supportive of such measures , but have been keen to ensure they would not mean extra work for teachers .
