dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .

i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.08.2006 germany 's extreme sauna-goers sweat it out for national title großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're still smiling more than they 're sweating did n't think sitting around in a steamy sauna qualified as an extreme sport ?
think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

" it 's all about building bridges between countries and cultures , " dreyer said . so given the current stand-off between iran and the international community , the appearance of the tehran symphony orchestra was nothing less than a cultural-political sensation . " increasing the profile of persian and arab culture in germany is currently an important task , " said osnabrück mayor hans-jürgen fip at the opening of the event , which lists foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as patron . it 's a task dreyer was happy to tackle . " inviting an iranian symphony orchestra to europe in this day and age is an organizational marathon and a diplomatic feat , " he said . once here , the musicians have found themselves the toast of the town , also scheduled to appear at the berlin state opera as guests of daniel barenboim . u n popular at home , popular abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nader mashayekhi since the islamic revolution in 1978 , western music has been widely frowned upon in iran .
nader mashayekhi , the recently appointed director of the tehran symphony orchestra , has made it his mission to encourage iran in a greater understanding and appreciation of europe 's classical music tradition .
but he also wants to show that iran itself has something to contribute - and sees his musicians as ambassadors of a more open-minded iran than the one the world is used to . " one of the major purposes of the orchestra is to demonstrate that even in persia , people have studied the classics , such as mozart and beethoven , " he said . hybrid forms when mashayekhi , who was based in vienna for 30 years , returned to his persian roots earlier this year , he resolved to introduce a broad repertoire that juxtaposed contemporary iranian pieces with tchaikovsky , brahms , and even frank zappa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statute of mozart in vienna another piece the orchestra performed in osnabrück was one of mashayekhi 's own , which blends persian elements with western influences , showcasing precisely what sets his ensemble apart from others . " we might be a symphony orchestra , but we 're a persian symphony orchestra , " he said .
" we have to make a virtue of necessity , and no one expects us to be the berlin philharmonic .
we can be ourselves , and that means being unique in our own way .
and no other orchestra can create this persian sound , which is all about a very specific culture . " the orchestra has no shortage of international projects , but it 's a different story back home - where operas are as unwelcome as female soloists . " it would be a dream to stage mozart , and i have in fact found a complete persian translation of figaro , " he said .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .
i think that what mr. prodi has done in the last couple of days is to be seen as a key player by all parties in the conflict , and i think that this is a positive development for his government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops already stationed in lebanon are in need of back-up do you think un secretary general kofi annan will see it the same way and agree to allow italy to lead a peacekeeping mission ? i would not be surprised if he did .
i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .
this is perceived totally differently - it 's perceived as an attempt by the united nations to stop warring parties , so this is a very different story . franco pavoncello is the head of the political science department at rome 's john cabot university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?

but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .

israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?

but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .

i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : violence in the middle east steinmeier cancels talks with syrian president propaganda wars fight for headlines in the middle east " germany should take part in lebanon peace-keeping mission " eu takes charge in cleaning oil spill on lebanese coast europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 opinion : israel deserved " war crime " label großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's peter philipp says amnesty international 's criticism of israel 's actions in lebanon was well deserved - and overdue .
now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .

around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .

" be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

" it 's all about building bridges between countries and cultures , " dreyer said . so given the current stand-off between iran and the international community , the appearance of the tehran symphony orchestra was nothing less than a cultural-political sensation . " increasing the profile of persian and arab culture in germany is currently an important task , " said osnabrück mayor hans-jürgen fip at the opening of the event , which lists foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as patron . it 's a task dreyer was happy to tackle . " inviting an iranian symphony orchestra to europe in this day and age is an organizational marathon and a diplomatic feat , " he said . once here , the musicians have found themselves the toast of the town , also scheduled to appear at the berlin state opera as guests of daniel barenboim . u n popular at home , popular abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nader mashayekhi since the islamic revolution in 1978 , western music has been widely frowned upon in iran .
nader mashayekhi , the recently appointed director of the tehran symphony orchestra , has made it his mission to encourage iran in a greater understanding and appreciation of europe 's classical music tradition .
but he also wants to show that iran itself has something to contribute - and sees his musicians as ambassadors of a more open-minded iran than the one the world is used to . " one of the major purposes of the orchestra is to demonstrate that even in persia , people have studied the classics , such as mozart and beethoven , " he said . hybrid forms when mashayekhi , who was based in vienna for 30 years , returned to his persian roots earlier this year , he resolved to introduce a broad repertoire that juxtaposed contemporary iranian pieces with tchaikovsky , brahms , and even frank zappa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statute of mozart in vienna another piece the orchestra performed in osnabrück was one of mashayekhi 's own , which blends persian elements with western influences , showcasing precisely what sets his ensemble apart from others . " we might be a symphony orchestra , but we 're a persian symphony orchestra , " he said .
" we have to make a virtue of necessity , and no one expects us to be the berlin philharmonic .
we can be ourselves , and that means being unique in our own way .
and no other orchestra can create this persian sound , which is all about a very specific culture . " the orchestra has no shortage of international projects , but it 's a different story back home - where operas are as unwelcome as female soloists . " it would be a dream to stage mozart , and i have in fact found a complete persian translation of figaro , " he said .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .

i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .
german ai head wants fact-finding mission in lebanon with fighting between israel and hezbollah now into its third week , the head of amnesty international 's german branch said her organization wants to send a commission to lebanon to investigate possible war crimes .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

officials believe there may be a terror organization behind him . the 20-year-old lebanese student turned himself in to the police in tripoli , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on thursday . german authorities said they were working to have the suspect extradited to germany . federal prosecutor rainer griesbaum told reporters that the extradition process could take days , weeks or even months .
he confirmed that germany and lebanon do not have an extradition agreement in place . identified by police as jihad hamad earlier this week , the suspect is believed to have planted bombs on two german trains last month .
hamad stands accused of membership in a terrorist organization as well as large-scale attempted murder and an attempt to detonate explosives .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 italy sending signal to eu , us with lebanon offer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike italy 's contribution in iraq , the lebanese mission enjoys wide support as the eu struggles to gather military contributions for lebanon , italy has said it would lead the peacekeeping mission .
dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .
i think that what mr. prodi has done in the last couple of days is to be seen as a key player by all parties in the conflict , and i think that this is a positive development for his government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops already stationed in lebanon are in need of back-up do you think un secretary general kofi annan will see it the same way and agree to allow italy to lead a peacekeeping mission ? i would not be surprised if he did .
i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .
this is perceived totally differently - it 's perceived as an attempt by the united nations to stop warring parties , so this is a very different story . franco pavoncello is the head of the political science department at rome 's john cabot university .
he was interviewed by jane conway . -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy offers 3,000 troops , leadership of un troops in lebanon a nine-day-old truce in lebanon appeared increasingly shaky on tuesday as the struggle to find european countries willing to commit forces to keep the peace between israel and hezbollah continued .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .
" i do n't have any complexes .
i do n't know any borders .
now i 'm making history . " high hopes for new ambassador bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski 's twin brother jaroslaw -lrb- r -rrb- was named prime minister in july one recent personnel change might also help to improve relations : poland has decided to replace its ambassador to germany .
marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .
the paper added that prawda 's strong command of german will allow him to reach the general public via media appearances and perhaps improve perceptions of his country . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de grass explains nazi episode to city of gdansk german novelist günter grass wrote a letter to the mayor of his hometown of gdansk , poland , admitting he may have erred in waiting so long to reveal his service in the nazis ' elite waffen ss corps .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "
another anomaly to common sauna practice in germany - the competitors all wear bathing suits to better protect sensitive body parts . the winner of the competition can look forward to further steamy encounters in the future , at the world sauna championships in - where else ?

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .
but the protests mostly go unheard . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de violence in the middle east click here for dw-world.de 's dossier of stories on the middle east conflict .

" it 's all about building bridges between countries and cultures , " dreyer said . so given the current stand-off between iran and the international community , the appearance of the tehran symphony orchestra was nothing less than a cultural-political sensation . " increasing the profile of persian and arab culture in germany is currently an important task , " said osnabrück mayor hans-jürgen fip at the opening of the event , which lists foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as patron . it 's a task dreyer was happy to tackle . " inviting an iranian symphony orchestra to europe in this day and age is an organizational marathon and a diplomatic feat , " he said . once here , the musicians have found themselves the toast of the town , also scheduled to appear at the berlin state opera as guests of daniel barenboim . u n popular at home , popular abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nader mashayekhi since the islamic revolution in 1978 , western music has been widely frowned upon in iran .
nader mashayekhi , the recently appointed director of the tehran symphony orchestra , has made it his mission to encourage iran in a greater understanding and appreciation of europe 's classical music tradition .
but he also wants to show that iran itself has something to contribute - and sees his musicians as ambassadors of a more open-minded iran than the one the world is used to . " one of the major purposes of the orchestra is to demonstrate that even in persia , people have studied the classics , such as mozart and beethoven , " he said . hybrid forms when mashayekhi , who was based in vienna for 30 years , returned to his persian roots earlier this year , he resolved to introduce a broad repertoire that juxtaposed contemporary iranian pieces with tchaikovsky , brahms , and even frank zappa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statute of mozart in vienna another piece the orchestra performed in osnabrück was one of mashayekhi 's own , which blends persian elements with western influences , showcasing precisely what sets his ensemble apart from others . " we might be a symphony orchestra , but we 're a persian symphony orchestra , " he said .
" we have to make a virtue of necessity , and no one expects us to be the berlin philharmonic .
we can be ourselves , and that means being unique in our own way .
and no other orchestra can create this persian sound , which is all about a very specific culture . " the orchestra has no shortage of international projects , but it 's a different story back home - where operas are as unwelcome as female soloists . " it would be a dream to stage mozart , and i have in fact found a complete persian translation of figaro , " he said .

think again .
around 40 germans will compete for the title of national sauna-going champion this weekend in stralsund . when the seaside town of stralsund was last in the nation 's headlines , it was because german chancellor angela merkel was receiving us president george w. bush for a get-to-know-you session over a little roasted boar .
it was a very sweaty occasion , not just because of the decision to barbecue a whole , rather sizeable , animal , but also because germany was in the grip of a heat wave that sent temperatures soaring to almost 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- . but that was nothing compared to what stralsunders will witness this friday when the national german sauna-going championships get underway .
the winner will be that hardy man or woman who can sweat it out the longest in a specially-built sauna heated to a blazing 110 degrees -lrb- celsius , that is -rrb- , with water being thrown on the stones at regular half-minute intervals . a local stralsund resident holds the current german record of 8:48 minutes . heat and humidity " sauna competitions are an extreme sport , " said the president of stralsund 's sauna club , wolfgang knobloch , adding that it 's not just the heat , but the extreme humidity that challenges competitors .
all the participants are examined by a doctor , however , and knobloch said that so far , no one has ever flipped out of their rubber shower shoes from the oppressive conditions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's toughest sauna-goers will be sweating it out in picturesque stralsund the rules of competition , in fact , fly in the face of sauna procedures recommended by the sauna appreciation society , which expressly states that the temperature should not be more than 80 to 90 degrees , and that " heat and steam competitions are unhealthy and do not belong in the sauna . " be that as it may , germany 's extreme sauna-goers have been training for months in the run-up to the championship , and have even developed tricks to help them sweat it out for longer .
some protect their skin with special gels , said knobloch , while others cool their bodies down beforehand " until they 're blue . "

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .

i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .
this is perceived totally differently - it 's perceived as an attempt by the united nations to stop warring parties , so this is a very different story . franco pavoncello is the head of the political science department at rome 's john cabot university .

now , he hopes hezbollah gets its due . amnesty international has come under heavy fire .
during its 34-day war with lebanon 's hezbollah , israel committed war crimes , the rights organization said .
they called for the united nations to examine the situation .
amnesty accuses israel of systematically bombarding lebanese civilian targets , in clear violation of martial and international law . no spokesman for the israeli regime can deny these charges , or gloss over them .
naturally , israel attacked actual , and supposed , hezbollah strongholds in southern lebanon , from which rockets had been launched .
at the same time , the israeli air force reduced to ashes the overwhelmingly shiite neighborhoods on the southern edge of beirut , and destroyed nearly all of the country 's infrastructure . awaiting hezbollah account they said they had to do this in order to cut off hezbollah 's supply lines , but in reality , they did it without taking the civilian population into account .
the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .
in contrast to israel , hezbollah is not an organized state , but a hard-to-define militia .
it is a further example for the imbalance of an " asymmetrical conflict " : states always get a worse deal than non-states .
has there ever , in the history of the world , been a militia that has obeyed international laws ?
it is not meant as an excuse for hezbollah , but the fact is , a state like israel - which sees itself bound by international law - will be judged differently than a militia in such situations . unfair ?
perhaps .
but it represents the increased responsibility that comes with being a recognized state .
especially one that repeatedly uses international law in its own interest .
israel needs to learn that it will be measured against the same standard that it uses to its own ends . finally , as imbalanced as amnesty international 's statements are , they are nonetheless a beginning .
the latest war against lebanon was not the first time israel broke international conventions , especially international law . in the palestinian territories , such transgressions are an almost daily occurrence .

the bombardment of the beirut airport and the roads that could allow people to flee to safety from the south , as well as the maritime blockade all fall in the same category : collective punishment , in violation of international law . so amnesty was correct in its charges .
but it would have made things much easier for the organization if amnesty had released its critiques of hezbollah 's actions in the war alongside those of israel .
it says it will release its comments on lebanon separately , but has so far managed to put off doing it . yet one thing is already clear : israel is not the only party in this conflict to have broken international conventions .
hezbollah shot rockets at civilian targets in israel - and not just in this conflict , but long previously . hezbollah even used its own population as a defensive shield .
not , as israel claims , by shooting rockets " out of apartment buildings . "
but because they did , in fact , shoot rockets from residential areas , including gardens , courtyards and very nearby apartment buildings . state 's disadvantage but it is going to be hard for amnesty to criticize hezbollah for this behavior .

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .
i think that what mr. prodi has done in the last couple of days is to be seen as a key player by all parties in the conflict , and i think that this is a positive development for his government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops already stationed in lebanon are in need of back-up do you think un secretary general kofi annan will see it the same way and agree to allow italy to lead a peacekeeping mission ? i would not be surprised if he did .
i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .
this is perceived totally differently - it 's perceived as an attempt by the united nations to stop warring parties , so this is a very different story . franco pavoncello is the head of the political science department at rome 's john cabot university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.08.2006 german-polish relations hit a rocky patch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the people stay friends even when the politicians quarrel ?
from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies .

from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship .

officials believe there may be a terror organization behind him . the 20-year-old lebanese student turned himself in to the police in tripoli , germany 's federal prosecutor 's office confirmed on thursday . german authorities said they were working to have the suspect extradited to germany . federal prosecutor rainer griesbaum told reporters that the extradition process could take days , weeks or even months .

dw-radio spoke with italian political scientist franco pavoncello about italy 's decision . dw-radio : why is italian prime minister romano prodi so keen to lead a peacekeeping force in lebanon ? pavoncello : i think that there are several reasons .
one is that mr. prodi sees the possibility of sending a signal both to the europeans and to the americans that his government is taking an international role , and the other is that this position on lebanon is widely accepted by the majority , so in a way , it is an element of cohesion within the government . do you think it will improve italy 's image in europe ? i think so .
i think that what mr. prodi has done in the last couple of days is to be seen as a key player by all parties in the conflict , and i think that this is a positive development for his government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un troops already stationed in lebanon are in need of back-up do you think un secretary general kofi annan will see it the same way and agree to allow italy to lead a peacekeeping mission ? i would not be surprised if he did .
i think that italy so far has had an important role in taking the initiative , and stimulating other countries to send troops . looking at figures , how many troops in total is rome prepared to send and what functions will they be performing in lebanon ? they have already committed about 3,000 soldiers and the rules of engagement have been spelled out clearly and have appeared in the press , so i think the italian people are willing to accept it . italy has already pulled troops out of iraq due to public opinion - could n't this mission end in a similar way , or provoke similar reactions from italians ? no , i think these are two very different situations .
i mean , iraq was seen as a move on the coattails of the united states ' intervention , and was perceived as joining in proactive action in a foreign county .
this is perceived totally differently - it 's perceived as an attempt by the united nations to stop warring parties , so this is a very different story . franco pavoncello is the head of the political science department at rome 's john cabot university .

dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland .

" what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship . " german-polish relations are better than many people think , which does n't mean that there 's not a lot left to be done , " said doris lemmermeier , the director of the german-polish youth organization , which has established contact between some 1.5 million young poles and germans in its 15 years of existence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass ' " the tin drum " is set during the nazi invasion of gdansk poles generally have a much more positive opinion of germans than germans do of poles , lemmermeier added .
though the german-polish youth organization was founded by the governments of the two countries and receives state funding , it functions independently . " we should keep ourselves as far away from day-to-day politics as possible , " she said . passing the baton to the next generation rafal solski , a 20-year-old artist from wroclaw , is someone who already has had plenty of contact with young germans . " frankly , the problem with günter grass and the exhibition in berlin do n't affect me at all , " said solski , who is the director of the art project " wheelart " at the edith stein house . " i know history , " he said , adding that his grandmother labored in german work camps and his grandfather hid jews in his house during world war ii .

marek prawda will succeed andrzej byrts , who was found to have reported for the communist secret service during his time abroad as a student .
prawda , on the other hand , has already contributed to german-polish dialogue . " the polish side has complained that the german media reports on poland almost exclusively focus on the government leaders , which casts a shadow on the whole country , " wrote the süddeutsche zeitung .

from the " potato " satire to günter grass ' confession , politicians and newspapers in germany and poland have had plenty of tomatoes to throw in the past few weeks .
dw-world.de takes a closer look at the ramifications . the first in a recent series of blows was a cutting commentary in germany 's daily die tageszeitung that called polish president lech kaczynski a potato .
poland 's politicians did n't laugh . then came the uproar over a berlin exhibition on post-world war ii german expellees , with kaczynski calling the show " very unkind , unsettling and sad . " add günter grass ' recent confession to the tangle .
the 79-year-old nobel prize winning author admitted to having served in the nazi waffen ss as a young man , leading officials in his birthplace , the polish city of gdansk , to consider revoking his honorary citizenship . positive experiences are the recent cross-border squabbles merely the result of sparring politicians and quick-penned journalists ?
or have the countries ' deep historical wounds - despite years of reconciliation work - only scabbed over and not fully healed ? dieter bingen , poland expert and director of the german poland institute in darmstadt said that polish politicians and media reports have recently cast a shadow on germany 's traditional image as " a strategic partner and reliable friend in poland . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach organized the controversial expellee exhibition in berlin but " the majority of poles are more mature and even-tempered and have had a good deal of positive experiences with germany , " he added . dominik ptak , the director of the edith stein society in wroclaw , differentiated between political relations and the general population and said that " normal interpersonal contact " between germans and poles is very positive . " what politicians do and say has absolutely no influence on direct polish-german relations , " said ptak , whose organization is dedicated to improving german-polish and christian-jewish dialogue .
" politicians simply should n't try to score political points by brandishing their swords and looking for enemies . " according to bingen , key polish politicians are seeking to draw attention to their country by adopting a " friend-enemy , black-and-white " approach . " this anti-modern , somewhat authoritarian way of thinking contradicts the experiences of the poles , " he said . partners in the european union a good part of what poles and germans know about each other can be attributed to cooperation projects that have increased over the past several years , especially in conjunction with poland 's accession to the european union in 2004 . the german-polish year , a massive event initiated by warsaw and berlin and sponsored by dozens of cultural organizations , concluded in may 2006 after the completion of hundreds of projects aimed at strengthening the bilateral friendship .

" it 's all about building bridges between countries and cultures , " dreyer said . so given the current stand-off between iran and the international community , the appearance of the tehran symphony orchestra was nothing less than a cultural-political sensation . " increasing the profile of persian and arab culture in germany is currently an important task , " said osnabrück mayor hans-jürgen fip at the opening of the event , which lists foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier as patron . it 's a task dreyer was happy to tackle . " inviting an iranian symphony orchestra to europe in this day and age is an organizational marathon and a diplomatic feat , " he said . once here , the musicians have found themselves the toast of the town , also scheduled to appear at the berlin state opera as guests of daniel barenboim . u n popular at home , popular abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nader mashayekhi since the islamic revolution in 1978 , western music has been widely frowned upon in iran .
nader mashayekhi , the recently appointed director of the tehran symphony orchestra , has made it his mission to encourage iran in a greater understanding and appreciation of europe 's classical music tradition .
but he also wants to show that iran itself has something to contribute - and sees his musicians as ambassadors of a more open-minded iran than the one the world is used to . " one of the major purposes of the orchestra is to demonstrate that even in persia , people have studied the classics , such as mozart and beethoven , " he said . hybrid forms when mashayekhi , who was based in vienna for 30 years , returned to his persian roots earlier this year , he resolved to introduce a broad repertoire that juxtaposed contemporary iranian pieces with tchaikovsky , brahms , and even frank zappa . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statute of mozart in vienna another piece the orchestra performed in osnabrück was one of mashayekhi 's own , which blends persian elements with western influences , showcasing precisely what sets his ensemble apart from others . " we might be a symphony orchestra , but we 're a persian symphony orchestra , " he said .
" we have to make a virtue of necessity , and no one expects us to be the berlin philharmonic .
we can be ourselves , and that means being unique in our own way .
and no other orchestra can create this persian sound , which is all about a very specific culture .

a us team created the lines by removing single cells from embryos , a process that left them intact , they report in the journal nature .
at present , growing this type of stem cell results in embryo destruction .
the researchers say their findings may remove some of the ethical barriers to this field and provide a way of bypassing current us legislation . "
under us law , federal funding is limited for research in which an embryo is destroyed .
clearly this approach does not involve the destruction of an embryo " professor robert lanza what are stem cells ?
in 1995 , the us congress passed an amendment stating that the government would not fund research in which human embryos were destroyed .
and in 2001 , president george w bush declared federal funding would only be available for research using the 61 human embryonic stem cells lines already in existence , where a " life or death decision had already been made " .
this meant no funding for the creation of new lines - whether from existing embryos or cloned embryos .
us stem cell researchers said the funding limits had ensured the us lagged behind in this field of research , limiting new studies to private companies , while pro-lifers hailed the decision .
scientists believe stem cells may one day help to combat a range of diseases , such as alzheimer 's or parkinson 's disease , or to repair spinal cord injury .
' ethical barriers ' a spokeswoman for mr bush described the new approach as encouraging .
but the bbc 's james westhead , in washington , says it is not yet clear whether the new technique gets around the funding restrictions .
questions about its effectiveness , and whether it really is a more ethically acceptable approach , means this is unlikely to herald the end of the deeply divisive debate , our correspondent says .
professor robert lanza , medical director of advanced cell technology -lrb- act -rrb- in massachusetts , us , and lead author on the paper , said : " we have shown for the first time you can create human embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo and thus without destroying its potential for life . "
using spare human ivf embryos , the researchers removed single cells from them , employing the same procedure used for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , a technique that has been used in ivf so cells can be removed from the embryo and tested for genetic disorders .
the process , said the team , leaves the embryo intact , enabling it to continue and grow into a healthy foetus .
of the 16 embryos used , they developed two long-term stem cell lines , which , professor lanza said , were " genetically normal and able to generate all of the cell types of the body " .
if the research is successfully replicated by other scientists , this could mean more stem cell lines for research and potentially tailored stem cell lines which could be used for children born through pgd .
limited relevance david christensen , from the family research council - a us-based conservative group , said the research " shows many more researchers are seeing that we need alternatives to destroying human embryos to get stem cells " . "
i am unconvinced by the ethical arguments - spare ivf embryos used to derive the cell lines would have been destroyed anyway " professor robin lovell-badge " unfortunately what professor lanza did was entirely unethical because he generated and manipulated 16 human embryos and then threw them all away , " he added .
other scientists said while the paper marked a technical achievement , they were concerned about its practical relevance .
professor robin lovell-badge , at the uk 's mrc national institute for medical research , said : " i am also unconvinced by the ethical arguments - spare ivf embryos used to derive es cell lines would have been destroyed anyway . "
professor chris shaw , a neurologist at the institute of psychiatry , king 's college london , said : " this is a useful alternative source for embryonic stem cells but it side-steps the crucial ethical question : ' what happens to those embryos found to have a genetic mutation and those that are healthy but excess to requirement ?

at present , growing this type of stem cell results in embryo destruction .
the researchers say their findings may remove some of the ethical barriers to this field and provide a way of bypassing current us legislation .
under us law , federal funding is limited for research in which an embryo is destroyed .
clearly this approach does not involve the destruction of an embryo professor robert lanza what are stem cells ?
in 1995 , the us congress passed an amendment stating that the government would not fund research in which human embryos were destroyed .
and in 2001 , president george w bush declared federal funding would only be available for research using the 61 human embryonic stem cells lines already in existence , where a " life or death decision had already been made " .
this meant no funding for the creation of new lines - whether from existing embryos or cloned embryos .
us stem cell researchers said the funding limits had ensured the us lagged behind in this field of research , limiting new studies to private companies , while pro-lifers hailed the decision .
scientists believe stem cells may one day help to combat a range of diseases , such as alzheimer 's or parkinson 's disease , or to repair spinal cord injury .
' ethical barriers ' a spokeswoman for mr bush described the new approach as encouraging .
but the bbc 's james westhead , in washington , says it is not yet clear whether the new technique gets around the funding restrictions .
supporters argue the research could save many lives questions about its effectiveness , and whether it really is a more ethically acceptable approach , means this is unlikely to herald the end of the deeply divisive debate , our correspondent says .
professor robert lanza , medical director of advanced cell technology -lrb- act -rrb- in massachusetts , us , and lead author on the paper , said : " we have shown for the first time you can create human embryonic stem cells without destroying the embryo and thus without destroying its potential for life . "
using spare human ivf embryos , the researchers removed single cells from them , employing the same procedure used for pre-implantation genetic diagnosis -lrb- pgd -rrb- , a technique that has been used in ivf so cells can be removed from the embryo and tested for genetic disorders .
the process , said the team , leaves the embryo intact , enabling it to continue and grow into a healthy foetus .
of the 16 embryos used , they developed two long-term stem cell lines , which , professor lanza said , were " genetically normal and able to generate all of the cell types of the body " .
if the research is successfully replicated by other scientists , this could mean more stem cell lines for research and potentially tailored stem cell lines which could be used for children born through pgd .
limited relevance david christensen , from the family research council - a us-based conservative group , said the research " shows many more researchers are seeing that we need alternatives to destroying human embryos to get stem cells " .
i am unconvinced by the ethical arguments - spare ivf embryos used to derive the cell lines would have been destroyed anyway professor robin lovell-badge " unfortunately what professor lanza did was entirely unethical because he generated and manipulated 16 human embryos and then threw them all away , " he added .
other scientists said while the paper marked a technical achievement , they were concerned about its practical relevance .
professor robin lovell-badge , at the uk 's mrc national institute for medical research , said : " i am also unconvinced by the ethical arguments - spare ivf embryos used to derive es cell lines would have been destroyed anyway . "
professor chris shaw , a neurologist at the institute of psychiatry , king 's college london , said : " this is a useful alternative source for embryonic stem cells but it side-steps the crucial ethical question : ' what happens to those embryos found to have a genetic mutation and those that are healthy but excess to requirement ?

he has every reason to cheer .
two years ago , mr bennett was running a struggling equestrian business , buying and selling imported cars on the side to make ends meet .
now he is on top of the world , having transformed his farm into perhaps the fastest growing polo club in the land .
new players halfway through its second season , jeans-clad members are milling around fifield 's relaxed yard .
mr bennett is convinced the club 's down-to-earth atmosphere has done a great deal to attract its 105 players , a members ' list that makes it the uk 's fourth or fifth largest polo club .
fifield , with its 130 polo ponies on site , is one of a string of new clubs that have been established in recent years by farmers , business people or enthusiasts , all of them eager to live the dream and to tap into the rapid growth of the " sport of kings " .
since 2000 , the number of polo clubs has risen from fewer than 40 to almost 60 , and more are still being built , according to the sport 's governing body , the hurlingham polo association .
during the same period , the number of registered players in the uk has also soared , from fewer than 2,000 to almost 2,500 , and the numbers are still growing strongly .
" this would n't have worked 10 , or maybe even five , years ago , " says mr bennett , as he shows off his immaculate yard , with its three-and-a-half polo pitches and an outdoor arena that makes winter games possible .
high finance , low margins indeed , it may not even work that well these days .
in the words of charles stisted , chief executive of the venerable guards polo club , one of the oldest and most prestigious polo establishments in the uk : " clubs are all self-financing , as it were , but i do n't know of a club that 's profitable as such . "
money is a constant worry for mr bennett as he wanders around the yard , checking the horses , chatting to members .
" there 's a bit of passion and a bit of business here , " acknowledges mr bennett , who has invested a couple of million pounds in the business .
" but i went into this with my eyes open .
i knew i would n't be bill gates in 10 years . "
mr bennett believes he has spotted a gap in the market .
" we seem to get the younger london person , " he says .
" most of them work for the likes of ubs , jp morgan or citigroup .
they 're traders and that , or they work for hedge funds . "
budget polo having wealthy clients helps , says mr bennett , pointing to how one of the club 's members , man financial executive john wentzell , has both paid for the club 's grandstand and digital scoreboard , as well as convinced his company to sponsor tournaments .
yet , in spite of such cash injections from the world of finance , fifield and guards are worlds apart . "
in our first years of polo , we needed someone who perhaps knew a bit more about the game than we did " tony bennett , on hiring brazilian polo pro henrique novaes luxury brands target polo set guards is famous for its high-goal -lrb- that is , top-level professional -rrb- tournaments , its links with the royal family and its glamorous parties .
fifield is more of a spit-and-sawdust sort of place .
" we 're no competition to them , " says mr bennett .
" it 's like formula one and go-karting .
if a member leaves us to go to guards , it is natural progression . "
whereas playing members at guards might have a string of polo ponies worth tens of thousands of pounds each , fifield members often rent theirs at £ 50- £ 70 a chukka , thus bringing the cost of playing a match down to just a few hundred pounds .
add the club 's £ 1,250 summer membership fee and it still adds up to what most people would consider a lot of money .
yet it is much cheaper than high-goal polo , where a season can cost a professional player in excess of £ 100,000 , says professional polo player jack kidd .
close links the links between high-goal clubs like guards and low-goal clubs like fifield are nevertheless close , not least because of the way the latter " feeds patrons into the sport " , according to mr kidd .
he reckons that about one in 10 newcomers to polo ends up as a patron who pays to play on the same team as the pros .
" everyone who wants to play and wants to have fun needs at least one pro per team , " according to brazilian polo pro henrique novaes .
but the patrons do more than that .
they also often end up employing a lot of people .
for every wealthy patron , there will be a queue of people waiting to receive his or her cash , including grooms and farriers , horse box drivers and mechanics , vets and ambulance drivers , to name but a few .
many of the sport 's professional support staff come to the uk from argentina or brazil to work during the summer season .
take mr novaes , who was asked by mr bennett to come and manage fifield polo club .
" in our first years of polo , we needed someone who perhaps knew a bit more about the game than we did , " quips mr bennett .

he has every reason to cheer .
two years ago , mr bennett was running a struggling equestrian business , buying and selling imported cars on the side to make ends meet .
now he is on top of the world , having transformed his farm into perhaps the fastest growing polo club in the land .
new players halfway through its second season , jeans-clad members are milling around fifield 's relaxed yard .
mr bennett is convinced the club 's down-to-earth atmosphere has done a great deal to attract its 105 players , a members ' list that makes it the uk 's fourth or fifth largest polo club .
fifield , with its 130 polo ponies on site , is one of a string of new clubs that have been established in recent years by farmers , business people or enthusiasts , all of them eager to live the dream and to tap into the rapid growth of the " sport of kings " .
since 2000 , the number of polo clubs has risen from fewer than 40 to almost 60 , and more are still being built , according to the sport 's governing body , the hurlingham polo association .
during the same period , the number of registered players in the uk has also soared , from fewer than 2,000 to almost 2,500 , and the numbers are still growing strongly .
" this would n't have worked 10 , or maybe even five , years ago , " says mr bennett , as he shows off his immaculate yard , with its three-and-a-half polo pitches and an outdoor arena that makes winter games possible .
high finance , low margins indeed , it may not even work that well these days .
many join fifield polo club because of the relaxed atmosphere in the words of charles stisted , chief executive of the venerable guards polo club , one of the oldest and most prestigious polo establishments in the uk : " clubs are all self-financing , as it were , but i do n't know of a club that 's profitable as such . "
money is a constant worry for mr bennett as he wanders around the yard , checking the horses , chatting to members .
" there 's a bit of passion and a bit of business here , " acknowledges mr bennett , who has invested a couple of million pounds in the business .
" but i went into this with my eyes open .
i knew i would n't be bill gates in 10 years . "
mr bennett believes he has spotted a gap in the market .
" we seem to get the younger london person , " he says .
" most of them work for the likes of ubs , jp morgan or citigroup .
they 're traders and that , or they work for hedge funds . "
budget polo having wealthy clients helps , says mr bennett , pointing to how one of the club 's members , man financial executive john wentzell , has both paid for the club 's grandstand and digital scoreboard , as well as convinced his company to sponsor tournaments .
yet , in spite of such cash injections from the world of finance , fifield and guards are worlds apart .
in our first years of polo , we needed someone who perhaps knew a bit more about the game than we did tony bennett , on hiring brazilian polo pro henrique novaes luxury brands target polo set guards is famous for its high-goal -lrb- that is , top-level professional -rrb- tournaments , its links with the royal family and its glamorous parties .
fifield is more of a spit-and-sawdust sort of place .
" we 're no competition to them , " says mr bennett .
" it 's like formula one and go-karting .
if a member leaves us to go to guards , it is natural progression . "
whereas playing members at guards might have a string of polo ponies worth tens of thousands of pounds each , fifield members often rent theirs at £ 50- £ 70 a chukka , thus bringing the cost of playing a match down to just a few hundred pounds .
add the club 's £ 1,250 summer membership fee and it still adds up to what most people would consider a lot of money .
yet it is much cheaper than high-goal polo , where a season can cost a professional player in excess of £ 100,000 , says professional polo player jack kidd .
close links the links between high-goal clubs like guards and low-goal clubs like fifield are nevertheless close , not least because of the way the latter " feeds patrons into the sport " , according to mr kidd .
he reckons that about one in 10 newcomers to polo ends up as a patron who pays to play on the same team as the pros .
many polo grooms come to the uk from brazil or argentina " everyone who wants to play and wants to have fun needs at least one pro per team , " according to brazilian polo pro henrique novaes .
but the patrons do more than that .
they also often end up employing a lot of people .
for every wealthy patron , there will be a queue of people waiting to receive his or her cash , including grooms and farriers , horse box drivers and mechanics , vets and ambulance drivers , to name but a few .
many of the sport 's professional support staff come to the uk from argentina or brazil to work during the summer season .

people opposed to the decision to use the former hafod quarry in johnstown as a landfill site have held protests since it was opened on wednesday .
planning permission to use the site for landfill was granted 11 years ago but a campaign was fought to stop it opening .
mwh associated ltd , which will dispose of waste at the quarry , said it was " acting perfectly properly . "
wrexham council said it would listen to complaints if conditions were not met .
rubbish lorries protesters believe the dump will cause lasting damage to conservation in the area and effect local residents , and have pledged to continue their stand .
they met the first rubbish lorries to arrive at the site on wednesday morning and continued their protest on thursday .
the hafod environmental group is particularly concerned about a special area of conservation -lrb- sac -rrb- within the quarry , which is inhabited by great crested newts .
a high court challenged failed and they are now awaiting a response from the european commission .
the group claim mersey waste holdings should not be allowed to tip rubbish into landfill until a meeting is held next month , when wrexham council decides whether to modify or revoke the licence , to protect the sac .
pauline smout , chair of the group , said : " we are sick and tired of our immediate area being used as a dumping ground and feel totally unprotected by the quangos supposed to protect us and the environment . "
lawrence isted , wrexham council 's chief planning officer , said ahead of the september meeting the developer was not in breach of any planning condition and tipping could start .
' dealing with the impact ' but he added : " if , however , residents have information that any of the conditions have not been met they should bring this to my attention . "
environment agency wales spokesman dave powell said : " it is vital that every company operates within their permit conditions to make sure they pose as small a risk to the local environment and human health as possible .
" it is our job to make sure that they stick to these requirements .
" the reality is that waste is an increasing problem across england and wales .
we are producing too much waste and are rapidly running out of landfill .
" we need to be recycling more , but also composting and reducing the amount of waste packaging we bring into our homes to reduce our dependency on landfill . "
rob allan , managing director of mwh associates limited , said the company was " acting perfectly properly " .
he added : " wrexham council are dealing with the impact of the sac on minerals permission , and the existing planning consent , and therefore a new planning application is unnecessary . "

operating profits rose to £ 151.3m -lrb- $ 286m -rrb- in the six months to 30 june , from £ 134.7m a year earlier .
the group added overall winnings had risen 12 % to £ 523.1m , driven by the football world cup and online gaming .
it also unveiled plans to invest £ 68m in new betting shops , and online and phone operations in italy .
however , it delayed plans to enter the us market .
ladbrokes said the early departure of several favourites from the world cup had led to the football tournament becoming the biggest betting event so far in the company 's history .
' record earnings ' the event led to a gross win of £ 17.5m across the firm 's operations . "
the decision on whether to take business from us customers on our gaming sites remains under review " ladbrokes meanwhile , good results from several key horse racing meetings , including aintree and ascot , also helped boost ladbrokes ' performance .
" the first half of 2006 , our first reporting period as a stand-alone entity , has seen record earnings for ladbrokes , increasing 12.3 % on last year , " chief executive christopher bell said .
the group 's online gaming business also fared well during the first half , with gross win surging 25 % to £ 76.2m , while the number of active unique players rose 37 % to 420,000 .
despite the firm signing up more sports betting on its website , it added that rising competition in the online poker market had had an effect .
us concerns recent events in the us have curtailed ladbroke 's plans to expand across the atlantic .
" in view of ongoing uncertainties within the us legislative environment , the decision on whether to take business from us customers on our gaming sites remains under review and we will update the market in due course , " ladbrokes said .
the news follows the recent arrest of former betonsports chief david carruthers in the us on charges of racketeering and fraud .
betonsports and executives from other gaming firms are facing a 22-count indictment as us authorities attempt to crack down on internet gambling .
the case led to betonsports closing down its us operations .
overseas moves developments in america have not dampened ladbroke 's appetite for expansion overseas , though .
as well as announcing its expansion into italy through a joint venture with pianeta scommesse , the group has made good progress in russia .
during the first six months of the year it , signed a joint venture with cyberview to provide standalone sports betting facilities to casinos in russia .
ladbrokes is also one of three companies shortlisted to run the sports lottery in vietnam and has formed a consortium with gaming systems provider intralot to bid for the turkish national lottery .

there are some 12,500 senegalese refugees in the gambia , the un refugee agency , unhcr , says .
separatists from a faction of the movement of democratic forces of casamance -lrb- mfdc -rrb- , led by hardliner salif sadio , began a new campaign against government forces earlier this year .
mr sadio has refused to join other rebel factions in peace talks with the senegalese authorities and continues to campaign for the independence of casamance .
the gambia lies between casamance and the rest of senegal .

entries this summer in german were down by 14.2 % , while french declined by 13.2 % and spanish by 0.5 % .
john dunford of the association of school and college leaders said the subjects were in " freefall " .
gcse languages were made non-compulsory in england in 2004 .
efforts are being made to raise take-up at primary level .
for the second year in a row , french showed the biggest decline among the major gcse subjects - those with 100,000 or more entries .
it was taken by 236,189 students , compared with 272,140 last year .
re and history up german fell through the 100,000 barrier to 90,311 and spanish was down to 62,143 .
the biggest riser among major subjects was religious studies - up 8.2 % , followed by ict and pe -lrb- up 6 % -rrb- , history -lrb- up 1.9 % -rrb- and maths -lrb- up 1.2 % -rrb- .
among the subjects with fewer than 100,000 entries , statistics was up 32.9 % and media , film and tv studies 25.9 % . "
it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools " alan johnson , education secretary mr dunford said many students were choosing the latter instead of languages as it was seen as an " easier " option .
but ellie johnson searle , director of the joint council for qualifications , which issues the results for the exam boards , said of media studies : " this is less than 10 % of the number doing maths and english .
" what we are looking at here is students being fitted for courses .
" they are also doing a number of other gcses and it 's important that they have a broad range of qualifications . "
but she added : " any fall in language take-up like that must be a cause for concern to everybody . "
brighter pupils were still gravitating towards foreign languages , dr johnson searle said .
' finding new ways ' however , dr dunford said : " fourteen-year-olds are disadvantaging themselves in the job market by giving up languages and the number of language teachers is declining .
" i think we have now passed the point of no return for languages in secondary schools .
" schools need to find new ways of teaching languages other than just gcses . "
he said more people had to start learning languages after the age of 16 and that schools had to introduce them in a more informal way , such as two-week full-time courses at the end of the academic year .
the government is making efforts to increase interest in subjects such as french and german among primary school pupils .
it is hoped this will increase participation at gcse in a few years ' time .
steve sinnott , general secretary of the national union of teachers , said languages had to be made compulsory again .
he also said he feared the primary school focus could " narrow " the range taught at secondary level to mainly french .
mr sinnott added : " subjects like portuguese and spanish are globally important languages .
there 's been a lot of interest in mandarin in recent years as well .
" i hope the primary school strategy does n't mean there 's simply a continuum of french learning and little else . "
' disappointing ' education secretary alan johnson said : " french continues to be in the top 10 most popular subjects but the overall decline in entries for languages , although not wholly unexpected , is disappointing .
" we have taken a sensible approach to what will make language learning thrive .
" it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools , finding new and exciting ways of teaching languages and better supporting those who show an aptitude for the subject .
" the early signs are encouraging and i am confident that these changes will deliver a new generation of linguists . "
rise of media studies this year , there were increases in the numbers who sat separate physics , chemistry and biology - all up more than 6 % in popularity .
the cbi has called for more students to study separate sciences , rather than the mixed " double award " , which counts as two gcses , taken by most .
there was a 3 % falling off in double award entries to 959,578 - which equates to half that number of people doing the subject .
chemistry and physics were overtaken by media , film and tv studies for the first time .
its entries totalled 57,521 - compared with 56,035 for physics and 56,764 for chemistry .

entries this summer in german were down by 14.2 % , while french declined by 13.2 % and spanish by 0.5 % .
john dunford of the association of school and college leaders said the subjects were in " freefall " .
gcse languages were made non-compulsory in england in 2004 .
efforts are being made to raise take-up at primary level .
for the second year in a row , french showed the biggest decline among the major gcse subjects - those with 100,000 or more entries .
it was taken by 236,189 students , compared with 272,140 last year .
re and history up german fell through the 100,000 barrier to 90,311 and spanish was down to 62,143 .
the biggest riser among major subjects was religious studies - up 8.2 % , followed by ict and pe -lrb- up 6 % -rrb- , history -lrb- up 1.9 % -rrb- and maths -lrb- up 1.2 % -rrb- .
among the subjects with fewer than 100,000 entries , statistics was up 32.9 % and media , film and tv studies 25.9 % .
it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools alan johnson , education secretary mr dunford said many students were choosing the latter instead of languages as it was seen as an " easier " option .
but ellie johnson searle , director of the joint council for qualifications , which issues the results for the exam boards , said of media studies : " this is less than 10 % of the number doing maths and english .
" what we are looking at here is students being fitted for courses .
" they are also doing a number of other gcses and it 's important that they have a broad range of qualifications . "
but she added : " any fall in language take-up like that must be a cause for concern to everybody . "
brighter pupils were still gravitating towards foreign languages , dr johnson searle said .
' finding new ways ' however , dr dunford said : " fourteen-year-olds are disadvantaging themselves in the job market by giving up languages and the number of language teachers is declining .
" i think we have now passed the point of no return for languages in secondary schools .
" schools need to find new ways of teaching languages other than just gcses . "
he said more people had to start learning languages after the age of 16 and that schools had to introduce them in a more informal way , such as two-week full-time courses at the end of the academic year .
the government is making efforts to increase interest in subjects such as french and german among primary school pupils .
it is hoped this will increase participation at gcse in a few years ' time .
steve sinnott , general secretary of the national union of teachers , said languages had to be made compulsory again .
he also said he feared the primary school focus could " narrow " the range taught at secondary level to mainly french .
mr sinnott added : " subjects like portuguese and spanish are globally important languages .
there 's been a lot of interest in mandarin in recent years as well .
" i hope the primary school strategy does n't mean there 's simply a continuum of french learning and little else . "
' disappointing ' education secretary alan johnson said : " french continues to be in the top 10 most popular subjects but the overall decline in entries for languages , although not wholly unexpected , is disappointing .
" we have taken a sensible approach to what will make language learning thrive .
" it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools , finding new and exciting ways of teaching languages and better supporting those who show an aptitude for the subject .
" the early signs are encouraging and i am confident that these changes will deliver a new generation of linguists . "
rise of media studies this year , there were increases in the numbers who sat separate physics , chemistry and biology - all up more than 6 % in popularity .
the cbi has called for more students to study separate sciences , rather than the mixed " double award " , which counts as two gcses , taken by most .
there was a 3 % falling off in double award entries to 959,578 - which equates to half that number of people doing the subject .
chemistry and physics were overtaken by media , film and tv studies for the first time .
its entries totalled 57,521 - compared with 56,035 for physics and 56,764 for chemistry .

entries this summer in german were down by 14.2 % , while french declined by 13.2 % and spanish by 0.5 % .
john dunford of the association of school and college leaders said the subjects were in " freefall " .
gcse languages were made non-compulsory in england in 2004 .
efforts are being made to raise take-up at primary level .
for the second year in a row , french showed the biggest decline among the major gcse subjects - those with 100,000 or more entries .
it was taken by 236,189 students , compared with 272,140 last year .
re and history up german fell through the 100,000 barrier to 90,311 and spanish was down to 62,143 .
the biggest riser among major subjects was religious studies - up 8.2 % , followed by ict and pe -lrb- up 6 % -rrb- , history -lrb- up 1.9 % -rrb- and maths -lrb- up 1.2 % -rrb- .
among the subjects with fewer than 100,000 entries , statistics was up 32.9 % and media , film and tv studies 25.9 % .
it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools alan johnson , education secretary mr dunford said many students were choosing the latter instead of languages as it was seen as an " easier " option .
but ellie johnson searle , director of the joint council for qualifications , which issues the results for the exam boards , said of media studies : " this is less than 10 % of the number doing maths and english .
" what we are looking at here is students being fitted for courses .
" they are also doing a number of other gcses and it 's important that they have a broad range of qualifications . "
but she added : " any fall in language take-up like that must be a cause for concern to everybody . "
brighter pupils were still gravitating towards foreign languages , dr johnson searle said .
' finding new ways ' however , dr dunford said : " fourteen-year-olds are disadvantaging themselves in the job market by giving up languages and the number of language teachers is declining .
" i think we have now passed the point of no return for languages in secondary schools .
" schools need to find new ways of teaching languages other than just gcses . "
he said more people had to start learning languages after the age of 16 and that schools had to introduce them in a more informal way , such as two-week full-time courses at the end of the academic year .
the government is making efforts to increase interest in subjects such as french and german among primary school pupils .
it is hoped this will increase participation at gcse in a few years ' time .
steve sinnott , general secretary of the national union of teachers , said languages had to be made compulsory again .
he also said he feared the primary school focus could " narrow " the range taught at secondary level to mainly french .
mr sinnott added : " subjects like portuguese and spanish are globally important languages .
there 's been a lot of interest in mandarin in recent years as well .
" i hope the primary school strategy does n't mean there 's simply a continuum of french learning and little else . "
' disappointing ' education secretary alan johnson said : " french continues to be in the top 10 most popular subjects but the overall decline in entries for languages , although not wholly unexpected , is disappointing .
" we have taken a sensible approach to what will make language learning thrive .
" it is not about forcing young people to study a language ; it is about starting in primary schools , finding new and exciting ways of teaching languages and better supporting those who show an aptitude for the subject .
" the early signs are encouraging and i am confident that these changes will deliver a new generation of linguists . "
rise of media studies this year , there were increases in the numbers who sat separate physics , chemistry and biology - all up more than 6 % in popularity .
the cbi has called for more students to study separate sciences , rather than the mixed " double award " , which counts as two gcses , taken by most .
there was a 3 % falling off in double award entries to 959,578 - which equates to half that number of people doing the subject .
chemistry and physics were overtaken by media , film and tv studies for the first time .
its entries totalled 57,521 - compared with 56,035 for physics and 56,764 for chemistry .
