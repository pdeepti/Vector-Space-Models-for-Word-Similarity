and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 04.02.2006 wanted : successful coaches - soccer men need not apply großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann is not changing sports but he thinks field hockey can help national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann is again at odds with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries . " i personally believe that it will be a problem to put somebody in this post who does not come from soccer , " dfb co-president gerhard meyer-vorfelder told kicker magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stern look from berti vogts who does n't think much of the peters idea world cup winner with west germany in 1974 , berti vogts , does not see how peters can help . " i think hockey is a different sport to soccer .
you can not compare the two and i can not believe the idea , " vogts , who coached germany to the euro 96 title , told kicker . " germany have been sleeping " when klinsmann and bierhoff made their proposal to hire peters , they knew they would be leaning quite far out the window .
klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .
something that can hardly be disputed after the national team disastrously crashed out of euro 2004 .
a little help from peters , who led the german field hockey to a world cup title in 2002 , may help close the gap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-dutch battles on the hockey pitch are also intense " bernhard peters is the man who can help us progress , " said klinsmann .
" it would do soccer some good to open up .
in the last 10 or 15 years we have been sleeping in germany . " the second dfb co-president theo zwanziger , who met peters together with klinsmann and assistant coach joachim löw , has not shot down the idea completely but has reservations about placing a man who does n't know the ins and outs of soccer in such a key job . power play in dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb : not exactly the innovators of german soccer soccer circles in germany believe there is more than meets the eye to the unorthodox choice of peters .
klinsmann has yet to extend his contract as national coach for the time after when the world cup ends .
when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .
club managers have bemoaned the strenuous fitness tests klinsmann has had the national players go through . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's recipe : success at the confed cup the good , and finally exciting , performance at the confederations cup last year confirmed his philosophy .
yet losses to turkey and slovakia and some poor play against the netherlands and china in the autumn have put klinsmann on the hot seat .
he wants to see his ideas come to fruition and the peters move is the next step . on february 8 , the dfb board will be convening a special meeting in franfkurt to make a decision .
should the 14-man board indeed bend to klinsmann 's will and offer peters the job , the sunny-boy of german soccer would have won a big battle . should meyer-vorfelder and the other doubting thomases have their way and appoint a second candidate - most are speculating matthias sammer , a soccer man through and through , would get the nod - it could well mean the end of the klinsmann era when the final whistle blows at the world cup final on july 9 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries . " i personally believe that it will be a problem to put somebody in this post who does not come from soccer , " dfb co-president gerhard meyer-vorfelder told kicker magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stern look from berti vogts who does n't think much of the peters idea world cup winner with west germany in 1974 , berti vogts , does not see how peters can help . " i think hockey is a different sport to soccer .
you can not compare the two and i can not believe the idea , " vogts , who coached germany to the euro 96 title , told kicker . " germany have been sleeping " when klinsmann and bierhoff made their proposal to hire peters , they knew they would be leaning quite far out the window .
klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .
something that can hardly be disputed after the national team disastrously crashed out of euro 2004 .
a little help from peters , who led the german field hockey to a world cup title in 2002 , may help close the gap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-dutch battles on the hockey pitch are also intense " bernhard peters is the man who can help us progress , " said klinsmann .
" it would do soccer some good to open up .
in the last 10 or 15 years we have been sleeping in germany . " the second dfb co-president theo zwanziger , who met peters together with klinsmann and assistant coach joachim löw , has not shot down the idea completely but has reservations about placing a man who does n't know the ins and outs of soccer in such a key job . power play in dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb : not exactly the innovators of german soccer soccer circles in germany believe there is more than meets the eye to the unorthodox choice of peters .
klinsmann has yet to extend his contract as national coach for the time after when the world cup ends .
when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .
club managers have bemoaned the strenuous fitness tests klinsmann has had the national players go through . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's recipe : success at the confed cup the good , and finally exciting , performance at the confederations cup last year confirmed his philosophy .
yet losses to turkey and slovakia and some poor play against the netherlands and china in the autumn have put klinsmann on the hot seat .
he wants to see his ideas come to fruition and the peters move is the next step . on february 8 , the dfb board will be convening a special meeting in franfkurt to make a decision .
should the 14-man board indeed bend to klinsmann 's will and offer peters the job , the sunny-boy of german soccer would have won a big battle . should meyer-vorfelder and the other doubting thomases have their way and appoint a second candidate - most are speculating matthias sammer , a soccer man through and through , would get the nod - it could well mean the end of the klinsmann era when the final whistle blows at the world cup final on july 9 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.02.2006 row over eu services directive simmers behind closed doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maneuvering has become more hectic as the vote on services nears brussels is aflame as lobbyists do their best to influence eu lawmakers to vote their way on controversial services legislation in mid-february . evelyne gebhardt sometimes feels overwhelmed by the amount of letters that piles up on her desk .
every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .

every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries . " i personally believe that it will be a problem to put somebody in this post who does not come from soccer , " dfb co-president gerhard meyer-vorfelder told kicker magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stern look from berti vogts who does n't think much of the peters idea world cup winner with west germany in 1974 , berti vogts , does not see how peters can help . " i think hockey is a different sport to soccer .
you can not compare the two and i can not believe the idea , " vogts , who coached germany to the euro 96 title , told kicker . " germany have been sleeping " when klinsmann and bierhoff made their proposal to hire peters , they knew they would be leaning quite far out the window .
klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .
something that can hardly be disputed after the national team disastrously crashed out of euro 2004 .
a little help from peters , who led the german field hockey to a world cup title in 2002 , may help close the gap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-dutch battles on the hockey pitch are also intense " bernhard peters is the man who can help us progress , " said klinsmann .
" it would do soccer some good to open up .
in the last 10 or 15 years we have been sleeping in germany . " the second dfb co-president theo zwanziger , who met peters together with klinsmann and assistant coach joachim löw , has not shot down the idea completely but has reservations about placing a man who does n't know the ins and outs of soccer in such a key job . power play in dfb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb : not exactly the innovators of german soccer soccer circles in germany believe there is more than meets the eye to the unorthodox choice of peters .
klinsmann has yet to extend his contract as national coach for the time after when the world cup ends .
when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .
club managers have bemoaned the strenuous fitness tests klinsmann has had the national players go through . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's recipe : success at the confed cup the good , and finally exciting , performance at the confederations cup last year confirmed his philosophy .
yet losses to turkey and slovakia and some poor play against the netherlands and china in the autumn have put klinsmann on the hot seat .
he wants to see his ideas come to fruition and the peters move is the next step . on february 8 , the dfb board will be convening a special meeting in franfkurt to make a decision .
should the 14-man board indeed bend to klinsmann 's will and offer peters the job , the sunny-boy of german soccer would have won a big battle . should meyer-vorfelder and the other doubting thomases have their way and appoint a second candidate - most are speculating matthias sammer , a soccer man through and through , would get the nod - it could well mean the end of the klinsmann era when the final whistle blows at the world cup final on july 9 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .

every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .

the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .

she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .

but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming .

german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.02.2006 row over eu services directive simmers behind closed doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maneuvering has become more hectic as the vote on services nears brussels is aflame as lobbyists do their best to influence eu lawmakers to vote their way on controversial services legislation in mid-february . evelyne gebhardt sometimes feels overwhelmed by the amount of letters that piles up on her desk .
every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.02.2006 row over eu services directive simmers behind closed doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maneuvering has become more hectic as the vote on services nears brussels is aflame as lobbyists do their best to influence eu lawmakers to vote their way on controversial services legislation in mid-february . evelyne gebhardt sometimes feels overwhelmed by the amount of letters that piles up on her desk .
every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

" the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming .

german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries . " i personally believe that it will be a problem to put somebody in this post who does not come from soccer , " dfb co-president gerhard meyer-vorfelder told kicker magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stern look from berti vogts who does n't think much of the peters idea world cup winner with west germany in 1974 , berti vogts , does not see how peters can help . " i think hockey is a different sport to soccer .
you can not compare the two and i can not believe the idea , " vogts , who coached germany to the euro 96 title , told kicker . " germany have been sleeping " when klinsmann and bierhoff made their proposal to hire peters , they knew they would be leaning quite far out the window .
klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .
something that can hardly be disputed after the national team disastrously crashed out of euro 2004 .
a little help from peters , who led the german field hockey to a world cup title in 2002 , may help close the gap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-dutch battles on the hockey pitch are also intense " bernhard peters is the man who can help us progress , " said klinsmann .
" it would do soccer some good to open up .

klinsmann has yet to extend his contract as national coach for the time after when the world cup ends .
when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .
club managers have bemoaned the strenuous fitness tests klinsmann has had the national players go through . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's recipe : success at the confed cup the good , and finally exciting , performance at the confederations cup last year confirmed his philosophy .
yet losses to turkey and slovakia and some poor play against the netherlands and china in the autumn have put klinsmann on the hot seat .
he wants to see his ideas come to fruition and the peters move is the next step . on february 8 , the dfb board will be convening a special meeting in franfkurt to make a decision .
should the 14-man board indeed bend to klinsmann 's will and offer peters the job , the sunny-boy of german soccer would have won a big battle . should meyer-vorfelder and the other doubting thomases have their way and appoint a second candidate - most are speculating matthias sammer , a soccer man through and through , would get the nod - it could well mean the end of the klinsmann era when the final whistle blows at the world cup final on july 9 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming .

german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming . " the resolution put off any un action against iran for at least a month , to give time for diplomacy until the next meeting in vienna in march of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- . but in a last-minute text change it mandated the board to " immediately thereafter -lrb- the march 6 board meeting -rrb- convey " a report and assessment by iaea chief mohamed elbaradei on iran to the security council . the transmission of this report would clear the way for the council to take action that is expected first to be a statement urging iranian cooperation , with sanctions a possibility later on . action to halt enrichment not punish iran , says us ambassador schulte said the idea was to get iran to yield to iaea calls to suspend all uranium enrichment activities and to cooperate fully with iaea inspectors , not to punish the islamic republic . the iaea has been investigating iran for three years on us charges that it is hiding nuclear weapons development but has reached no conclusions . the goal is " to add the council 's weight . . . for iran to choose a course of cooperation and negotiation over a course of confrontation , " schulte said . chinese ambassador wu hailong said his country did not see the resolution as allowing for un punitive action but schulte said it incorporated a september iaea resolution that found iran in non-compliance for hiding nuclear activities for almost two decades , a finding that requires the current report to the security council . merkel and rumsfeld say no to nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumsfeld was strongly critical of iran in munich .
german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .
the five permanent security council members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany had closed ranks over the resolution to take iran to the security council .
unlike the iaea , the security council has enforcement powers . the text is a compromise between the us desire for immediate security council action and russia 's demand for time for more diplomacy . russia , a key trade partner of iran , hopes the crisis can be defused without the security council imposing sanctions . moscow is sponsoring a compromise proposal for iran to carry out uranium enrichment in russia so that the iranians do not master this technology which is considered a " breakout capacity " for making atomic weapons . but vaidi told iranian state television that iran may no longer even consider the russian proposal . despite the iaea call for iran to suspend nuclear fuel work , tehran pressed ahead in january with preparations for uranium enrichment , after having in august resumed uranium conversion that makes the feedstock gas for enrichment . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology of the iran nuclear standoff the emergency meeting of the iaea with a probable referral to the un security council is the climax of three years of on-again , off-again negotiations with iran .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries . " i personally believe that it will be a problem to put somebody in this post who does not come from soccer , " dfb co-president gerhard meyer-vorfelder told kicker magazine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stern look from berti vogts who does n't think much of the peters idea world cup winner with west germany in 1974 , berti vogts , does not see how peters can help .

you can not compare the two and i can not believe the idea , " vogts , who coached germany to the euro 96 title , told kicker . " germany have been sleeping " when klinsmann and bierhoff made their proposal to hire peters , they knew they would be leaning quite far out the window .
klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .

klinsmann has yet to extend his contract as national coach for the time after when the world cup ends .
when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .
club managers have bemoaned the strenuous fitness tests klinsmann has had the national players go through . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann 's recipe : success at the confed cup the good , and finally exciting , performance at the confederations cup last year confirmed his philosophy .
yet losses to turkey and slovakia and some poor play against the netherlands and china in the autumn have put klinsmann on the hot seat .
he wants to see his ideas come to fruition and the peters move is the next step . on february 8 , the dfb board will be convening a special meeting in franfkurt to make a decision .
should the 14-man board indeed bend to klinsmann 's will and offer peters the job , the sunny-boy of german soccer would have won a big battle . should meyer-vorfelder and the other doubting thomases have their way and appoint a second candidate - most are speculating matthias sammer , a soccer man through and through , would get the nod - it could well mean the end of the klinsmann era when the final whistle blows at the world cup final on july 9 . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de league managers and klinsmann clear the air the german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and bundesliga team managers decided at an " emergency summit " to find common ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.02.2006 row over eu services directive simmers behind closed doors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maneuvering has become more hectic as the vote on services nears brussels is aflame as lobbyists do their best to influence eu lawmakers to vote their way on controversial services legislation in mid-february . evelyne gebhardt sometimes feels overwhelmed by the amount of letters that piles up on her desk .
every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

every day the socialist european parliament member -lrb- mep -rrb- receives numerous requests regarding the draft services directive since gebhardt is the rapporteur on the internal market and consumer protection committee -lrb- imco -rrb- who deals with the bill .
the flood of mail comes from concerned people from the 25 eu countries making a last minute bid to influence the vote . " of course , i get many requests , e-mails , calls from those concerned , from lobbyists and people who are worried , " gebhardt said .
" there are the organizations here in brussels who are specialized in it .
then there are companies and individuals .
i 'm very attentive when these things arrive , since when concern is expressed , a politician has to listen .
it 's important for me because it makes it clear to me where problems could lie . " the legislation will allow eu businesses to offer their services throughout the bloc according to the laws of their home countries .
western european trade unions and consumer protection organizations say the current draft could result in lower standards replacing the hard-fought social and environmental ones established in the course of decades .
legal arguments catelene passchier works for the european trade union federation , where she 's responsible for the services directive .
she 's one of the people who 's in regular contact with gebhardt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament will debate the issue later in the month " we try to -lrb- exert -rrb- influence by going to members of parliament and speaking to them - not only saying that what they do is wrong , but trying to argue with legal arguments and technical arguments and examples , " she explained . passchier has been working on the directive for two years so far , but now the work has become particularly intensive .
the upcoming vote is expected to determine the direction of all future negotiations on the legislation .
passchier is planning a huge demonstration for feb .
14 in strasbourg , the parliament 's seat , and has been meeting with meps continually on the issue that the trade unions oppose .
she says it 's especially important that the contentious principle allowing company 's to apply the legal conditions of their country of origin is discarded . that 's exactly what carlos almaraz of the european business organization unice wants kept intact .
he says the legislation must become a reality and spends his days fighting for it . " for the plenary meeting in february , we are about to adopt a letter that will be sent to all meps , and then we will soon start meetings with key meps , " said almaraz .
" in the letter , we give our assessment about the imco vote , the things that were adopted , and that we would like the plenary to endorse and then all the things that were not covered by the imco vote . "
bearing fruit unice has already had some success .
it was convinced that the legislation should be applied to all fields , while its opponents wanted exceptions to be made .
but the imco members voted not to restrict the directive to certain sectors , which almaraz views as a personal success .
but passchier is also confident since imco rapporteur gebhardt already significantly limited the country of origin principle in her report .
now , the point is to convince the other meps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gebhardt wants lottery and gambling excluded , among other services " we have continuous relations with some people in the parliament .
we work closely together , " passchier said .
" of course , there are some parties we work with on a continuous basis , which is all the parties of the center and the left .
but we also have good relations , and very important relations with , for instance , the christian democrats , who very often also have a trade union background or are related to trade unions with a christian background .
trade unionists are not only socialists . "
lobbyists also cultivate contacts among their own ilk , meeting regularly for working meals or conferences to exchange information .
for almaraz it 's important to talk to specialists from the various fields to better understand their concerns , which he can later use to help him convince meps of unice 's position .
and there 's still much work to be done . " the commission has had an unusual position , " almaraz remarked .
" it is striking to see that for such an important dossier they 've decided not to interfere at all in the discussions until the first reading is over .
we regret that that 's the decision , but we have to live with it .
and , of course , defending the legislation , which the commission would have done , is being filled by other organizations , like unice .
obviously we are using a lot of information from the commission and we feel sometimes as if we have drafted the directive , which is not the case . " the result of almaraz 's and passchier 's work may become visible on feb .

" today 's vote sends iran a very clear and unmistakable message that they need to abide by their international obligations and to heed the call of the international community , " state department spokesman sean mccormack told reporters . the resolution passed by 27-3 , with five abstentions , a majority us ambassador gregory schulte called " overwhelming .

german chancellor angela merkel told a security conference in munich that iran had " overstepped the mark " with its nuclear program , while us defense secretary donald rumsfeld said the world " did not want a nuclear iran . " german defense minister franz josef jung said , " the iranian nuclear program directly impacts on our security , because the repeated statements of the iranian president raised questions as to whether the nuclear program is solely for peaceful purposes .
therefore the decision to involve the security council with the iran case is correct . " but javad vaidi , a member of iran 's supreme national security council and head of the iranian delegation to the iaea meeting , told reporters " our government has to implement full-scale enrichment , " adding the iranian parliament had passed a law requiring this to be done if referral took place . vaidi said the " resolution is politically motivated since it is not based on any legal or technical grounds . " the vote at this week 's meeting of the iaea 's 35-nation board of governors was delayed friday when egypt insisted on adding a clause implying that israel should give up its alleged atomic weapons . the united states finally accepted a wording calling for a middle east zone free of " weapons of mass destruction " instead of just nuclear arms , as this lifted the exclusive focus on israel , a diplomat said . cuba , syria and venezuela , which all have disputes with the united states , voted against it , while algeria , belarus , indonesia , libya and south africa abstained . key non-aligned states brazil , egypt and india voted for it . p-5 and germany close ranks on common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran is on the way to the un security council .

the eternal optimist wants a field hockey coach to coordinate player development .
the dfb cronies have other thoughts . bernhard peters is by no means a household name in german sports publications .
unless field hockey is your favorite sport , you wo n't be familiar with the german men 's national coach in the sport . now , peters ' name has been thrown into the ring to assume a top-level post within german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- .
as technical director , he would assume control and coordinate player development for the dfb .
german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann and his managerial sidekick oliver bierhoff are the men behind the idea which does n't sit well with the dfb bosses . employing a director with absolutely no soccer credentials has been met with broad criticism from soccer functionaries .

klinsmann 's ideas , for example his use of an american fitness trainer to get the most physically out of his players , have not exactly been embrace wholeheartedly by a german soccer world that critics say have fallen behind the times . klinsmann himself feels there are some gaping deficits in german soccer .
something that can hardly be disputed after the national team disastrously crashed out of euro 2004 .

when he signed as team head in august 2004 , he in no uncertain terms said he wanted to turn things over in the dfb .
desperate at that time to find anybody who would take on the job after euro 2004 , the soccer association succumbed to his demands . and the dignitaries have gotten more than they expected from klinsmann , löw and co .
the coach 's long absences in his second home california have caused headaches for the dfb and the bundesliga teams .

" you have to pick up a stack of chips without counting and be able to tell by the way they feel that you have 20 . "
there is an art to spinning the ball on the roulette wheel and , while it is circling the wheel rim , you have to ensure the chips are placed correctly and no punters are changing their bet .
then there is the manual dexterity in perfecting the effortless but flash card shuffle required for the blackjack tables .
i went to vegas and never won a thing colleen mclaughlin , manager blackpool and fylde college , gaming academy the academy , which officially opens on 22 february , was set up in the wake of blackpool council 's own spin on the government 's wheel of fortune .
the council 's regeneration money is stacked on the casino advisory panel recommending that the resort should be the venue for the one regional super casino permitted under the gambling act 2005 .
eight large casinos and eight smaller new casinos will also be permitted under the first change in uk gaming laws since 1968 .
yet , according to the college , even if the council 's gamble failed it could hit the jackpot with an estimated 5,000 new jobs in the gaming industry up for grabs .
" there is going to be a great need for trained staff and we are well placed to take advantage of this , " said ms mclaughlin , although she admits having the super casino a few miles down the road , " would help us and help the town . "

"
the college is playing for high stakes having invested in a classroom casino with blackjack tables and roulette wheels and a slot machine workshop next door .
work placement in a real casino is illegal for the students so every effort is made to recreate the casino atmosphere in the classroom from piped music to the ever present noise of slot machines .
restricted access students must be 18 and over and it is the only part of the college where access is restricted .
the academy is offering a range of courses , including six-week croupier training , a two-year foundation degree in casino operations , management training for the industry and a 12-week diploma in casino operation .
management trainees from gala casinos , one of the uk 's bigger companies , are trained at the academy .
so what has attracted the current students ?
" it 's one of the best ways of seeing the world in safety , " said nichola roberts , 19 from oldham .
" i was looking for a challenge instead of the usual 9-5 , " said david ollerton , 34 , from belfast .
ali werfalli , 25 , studying with his fiancee carly hayes , 19 , from blackpool have already got jobs in casinos waiting for them once the course has finished .

i thought i might as well make some money out of it on the other side , " said ali .
carly , who swapped a job in a care home , added : " we were attracted by the fact that you can learn new skills and travel the world . "
which is what first attracted ms mclaughlin to an industry which has taken her to the med , southern africa and eventually back to blackpool .

eight large casinos and eight smaller new casinos will also be permitted under the first change in uk gaming laws since 1968 .
yet , according to the college , even if the council 's gamble failed it could hit the jackpot with an estimated 5,000 new jobs in the gaming industry up for grabs .
" there is going to be a great need for trained staff and we are well placed to take advantage of this , " said ms mclaughlin , although she admits having the super casino a few miles down the road , " would help us and help the town . "
the uk gaming industry 15,000 people work in 122 casinos 18,500 in the bingo industry 22,000 in slot machines uk punters spent £ 3.5bn on gambling chips in 2001/2 source : gambling commission the resort 's drive to become a lancashire vegas has brought a strong campaign opposed to the downside of the gambling boom - such as addiction and related social problems .
" we teach social responsibility and we train our students to be aware of problem gambling , " said ms mclaughlin .
this includes having a stock of leaflets from the charity gamcare - which helps problem gamblers .
she believes that a night at one of the uk 's 122 casinos for most people is not going to turn you into a hardened gambler .
" a lot of the customers are young people who are just going for a night out instead of clubbing . "
organised crime neither does the uk industry have the whiff of organised crime associated with us the gambling trade ms mclaughlin said : " when i got my first job i had to be interviewed by the local police - now to get your certificate to work in the industry you have to have a criminal records bureau check . "
the college is playing for high stakes having invested in a classroom casino with blackjack tables and roulette wheels and a slot machine workshop next door .
work placement in a real casino is illegal for the students so every effort is made to recreate the casino atmosphere in the classroom from piped music to the ever present noise of slot machines .
restricted access students must be 18 and over and it is the only part of the college where access is restricted .
the academy is offering a range of courses , including six-week croupier training , a two-year foundation degree in casino operations , management training for the industry and a 12-week diploma in casino operation .
management trainees from gala casinos , one of the uk 's bigger companies , are trained at the academy .
so what has attracted the current students ?
" it 's one of the best ways of seeing the world in safety , " said nichola roberts , 19 from oldham .
" i was looking for a challenge instead of the usual 9-5 , " said david ollerton , 34 , from belfast .
ali werfalli , 25 , studying with his fiancee carly hayes , 19 , from blackpool have already got jobs in casinos waiting for them once the course has finished .
david ollerton wanted a challenge away from 9-5 " i have visited casinos and never won anything .
i thought i might as well make some money out of it on the other side , " said ali .
carly , who swapped a job in a care home , added : " we were attracted by the fact that you can learn new skills and travel the world . "
which is what first attracted ms mclaughlin to an industry which has taken her to the med , southern africa and eventually back to blackpool .
she may be running a college department but give her a deck of cards or stack of chips and it is easy to see her first love .
although even this expertise was no use to her as a punter in las vegas .
" i went to vegas and never won a thing ! " she said .

councillor peter jones said : " our priorities for the local nhs are improved front-line services and improved efficiency , management and accountability . "
the leader of the council said : " we believe this is the most sensible way forward and we are urging the public and our partners to support this proposal . "

the girl herself ?
her parents ?
her teachers ?
the drug dealer ?
her neighbours ?
social workers ?
the police ?
the politicians who run the community where she lives ?
the politicians who run the society where she was brought up ?
if no one is to blame , do you just let her carry on ?
and if they are all to blame , what percentage of the blame do you apportion to each one ?
these are the questions which have been troubling holyrood this week .
and it is no hypothetical case .
the 11-year-old girl , from the east end of glasgow , was taken to hospital last week where doctors discovered she had been smoking heroin regularly for at least two months and had bought her supplies in £ 10 bags from a dealer at a local shopping centre .
it is thought there are more than 50,000 children in scotland living in households where there is at least one drug addict .
as part of the thrashing around at question time on thursday , first minister jack mcconnell announced " a review " of whether more of these children should be taken away from their parents and cared for by the local authority .
" the needs of the children have to come first , " he told msps .
" we have to give them the best possible start in life . "
drug education it signals a major shift away from the philosophy that children are always best left with their parents .
the scottish national party 's nicola sturgeon pointed out that the government 's £ 1 million programme of drug education in schools had been halted in 2004 .
" it 's a serious and fundamental flaw in the scottish executive 's drugs policy , " she said .
but mr mcconnell said that was misrepresenting the issue .
in fact every school had a drug education programme and the money was now mainstreamed into the overall budget .
the conservative leader annabel goldie said the executive was sending out mixed messages to children on drugs .
" if an 11-year-old girl asked the first minister about taking heroin , would he give her information designed to help her ' know the score ' -lrb- in the words of the executive 's anti-drugs campaign -rrb- so that she could decide for herself , or would he tell her how dangerous drug abuse is ? "
the first minister said the two things were the same .
from being tough on drugs to being tough on crime , the executive got its police bill through its first stage this week .
all the parties , except the socialists , backed this catch-all legislation .
it doubles the sentence for carrying a knife .
it allows for troublemakers to be excluded from football grounds .
it imposes a 28-day period of notice for holding a sectarian march .
it also establishes an independent police complaints commissioner .
and it strengthens the role of the drug enforcement agency .
it will become the scottish crime and drug enforcement agency , an independent police force , some have likened to the american fbi .
this has drawn criticism from the existing chief constables who fear it will erode their local power and expertise .
organ retention less contentious was the human tissue bill which was passed unanimously on thursday afternoon .
this seeks to increase the number of organs available for transplant and to clarify the rules on post-mortems and organ retention .
the bill makes it clear that when someone has registered as an organ donor , after death relatives will not have a veto .
liberal democrat john farquhar munro argued for a system of " presumed consent " favoured by the transplant doctors .
he said only 25 % of people actually got around to putting their names on the nhs donor register , despite the fact that the vast majority of people want to donate their organs .
rowdy debate the doctors estimate that 50 lives could be saved every year in scotland if we moved to " presumed consent " .
but the minister lewis macdonald said such a system was flawed , because it allowed relatives to object on the grounds of distress .
he argued more organs would become available for transplant under the bill because relatives could not object where patients had made their wishes clear before their death .
mr munro 's amendment was defeated by 87 votes to 18 .
on wednesday , we had a rowdy debate over the socialists ' bill to abolish the council tax and replace it with a local income tax , set nationally and bearing down heavily on the rich .
it was defeated by 94 votes to 12 but not before tommy sheridan had accused the snp and the liberal democrats of selling out on their commitment to a local income tax .
in the committee rooms , msps were shocked to learn that 3,000 nhs patients may have been infected with hepatitis c through blood transfusions but not all of their records could be traced .
health minister andy kerr promised the health committee he would look into it .
later an executive spokesman explained that a " look back " exercise had been carried out in 1995 .
food inquiry it had found that 379 blood donors had been found to have hepatitis c. a total of 858 patients had been infected through blood transfusions .
of these 515 have since died , 223 were tested and received counselling and 120 could not be traced .
at the environment committee , an inquiry has begun into the food industry - in particular the price of milk .
milk is typically selling in the supermarkets for about 50p a litre .
but only 18p goes to the farmer , less than the cost of production .
a total of 700 dairy farmers in scotland have gone out of business in the last five years , though the remaining 1,200 are keeping larger herds of cattle .
msps were keen to find out where the profits are going .
farmer john cummings from stranraer told the committee : " it 's not in my pocket , so it 's split between the wisemans of this world and the tescos of this world . "
the nfu man , john withers , pinned the blame on the supermarkets .
the supermarkets in turn blamed the falling demand for liquid milk and denied trying to put marginal dairy farmers out of business .
saturday night fever one of the interesting issues that emerged was that westminster 's competition policy is apparently preventing the formation of powerful farmers co-operatives , such as those found in france and the us , to counteract the power of the supermarkets .
the committee 's report will come out in the spring .
there was n't a lot to laugh about at holyrood this week .
even the members ' debates on wednesday and thursday evening were about the serious matters of childhood obesity and the decline in our village halls .
but wait , speaking of village halls , we had our equivalent this week , with a danceathon in the holyrood hotel in aid of malawi .
a total of £ 1,300 was raised .
i 'm told the best dancers were andy kerr , trish godman and johann lamont , though the first minister did his best with a wednesday night version of saturday night fever .

drugs were on the political agenda after an 11-year-old took heroin if no one is to blame , do you just let her carry on ?
and if they are all to blame , what percentage of the blame do you apportion to each one ?
these are the questions which have been troubling holyrood this week .
and it is no hypothetical case .
the 11-year-old girl , from the east end of glasgow , was taken to hospital last week where doctors discovered she had been smoking heroin regularly for at least two months and had bought her supplies in £ 10 bags from a dealer at a local shopping centre .
it is thought there are more than 50,000 children in scotland living in households where there is at least one drug addict .
as part of the thrashing around at question time on thursday , first minister jack mcconnell announced " a review " of whether more of these children should be taken away from their parents and cared for by the local authority .

in fact every school had a drug education programme and the money was now mainstreamed into the overall budget .
the conservative leader annabel goldie said the executive was sending out mixed messages to children on drugs .
" if an 11-year-old girl asked the first minister about taking heroin , would he give her information designed to help her ' know the score ' -lrb- in the words of the executive 's anti-drugs campaign -rrb- so that she could decide for herself , or would he tell her how dangerous drug abuse is ? "

the girl herself ?
her parents ?
her teachers ?
the drug dealer ?
her neighbours ?
social workers ?
the police ?
the politicians who run the community where she lives ?
the politicians who run the society where she was brought up ?
drugs were on the political agenda after an 11-year-old took heroin if no one is to blame , do you just let her carry on ?
and if they are all to blame , what percentage of the blame do you apportion to each one ?
these are the questions which have been troubling holyrood this week .
and it is no hypothetical case .
the 11-year-old girl , from the east end of glasgow , was taken to hospital last week where doctors discovered she had been smoking heroin regularly for at least two months and had bought her supplies in £ 10 bags from a dealer at a local shopping centre .
it is thought there are more than 50,000 children in scotland living in households where there is at least one drug addict .
as part of the thrashing around at question time on thursday , first minister jack mcconnell announced " a review " of whether more of these children should be taken away from their parents and cared for by the local authority .
" the needs of the children have to come first , " he told msps .
" we have to give them the best possible start in life . "
drug education it signals a major shift away from the philosophy that children are always best left with their parents .
the scottish national party 's nicola sturgeon pointed out that the government 's £ 1 million programme of drug education in schools had been halted in 2004 .
" it 's a serious and fundamental flaw in the scottish executive 's drugs policy , " she said .
but mr mcconnell said that was misrepresenting the issue .
in fact every school had a drug education programme and the money was now mainstreamed into the overall budget .
the conservative leader annabel goldie said the executive was sending out mixed messages to children on drugs .
" if an 11-year-old girl asked the first minister about taking heroin , would he give her information designed to help her ' know the score ' -lrb- in the words of the executive 's anti-drugs campaign -rrb- so that she could decide for herself , or would he tell her how dangerous drug abuse is ? "
