" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .

" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .
künast expected no surprises from the party 's rank-and-file . fdp to decide in march the change of heart should be greeted warmly by the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
one month ago , the fdp along with the left party had wanted to start an inquiry but the greens wavered and voted against the motion in parliament . in the current bundestag , a parliamentary inquiry can only be formed if all three opposition parties agree .
with the greens ' change of heart , this seems more likely .
the left party has already repeated their calls from earlier for an investigation .
the fdp has called a party caucus for march 7 to debate the motion . should the liberals join the ranks of their two opposition partners , politicians from the former and current government will have to answer to their fellow parliamentarians in the investigating committee . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany admits spies gave intelligence to us in iraq war two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war but did not help select bombing targets , a government report released late on thursday found .

" i was forced to make the most of the situation when i knew gold was impossible , " he said . the early part of the race became a duel between sikora and bjoerndalen , winner of five gold medals in the 1998 nagano and 2002 games . the norwegian , who had already picked up two silvers this time around in the pursuit and individual events , led after the first three visits to the shooting range but fell to third place after the fourth shooting test . greis , however , kept his nerve and took the lead from sikora shortly after the fourth shoot and maintained his advantage through to the finish . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin read more stories from the winter olympics in turin in this dw-world.de dossier soldier-athletes lead germany to medals germany has already clinched some 18 medals at the winter olympics underway in turin .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

one month ago , the fdp along with the left party had wanted to start an inquiry but the greens wavered and voted against the motion in parliament . in the current bundestag , a parliamentary inquiry can only be formed if all three opposition parties agree .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

some 11,000 turkeys have now been culled ; politicians are repeatedly urging the public not to panic . french president jacques chirac was informed that the h5n1 strain of the avian flu virus had been confirmed at a commercial poultry farm near lyon just hours before he was supposed to inaugurate an annual agriculture show in paris . around 11,000 turkeys had to be slaughtered while the farmer and five family members were given tamiflu as a precaution .
in addition , the family was taken to a nearby hospital and put under quarantine . nevertheless , chirac appealed to the french press not to create an atmosphere of alarm . " there is no interest in provoking a psychosis , a panic , it 's scandalous , " he said at the agriculture fair that was conspicuously absent of any poultry not withstanding the piece of chicken that the president was eating to demonstrate the safety of french fowl . poultry bans would do immense harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac appealed for calm after bird flu confirmation some 200,000 farms raise over 900 million animals annually in france , generating more than three billion euros -lrb- $ 3.6 bill . -rrb- in revenues , making it europe 's largest poultry exporter .
the eu is concerned that trading partners could overreact and place bans on imports from european countries . japan has temporarily prohibited all french poultry imports .
tokyo is also ready to halt the entry of chickens , turkeys and other edible birds from the netherlands if the dutch government launches a preventive vaccination plan for some of its flocks . the eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , also at the agriculture show in paris , told reuters such import bans would adversely affect the european union . " whilst i understand their decision to take preliminary measures , any action must be proportionate .
there can be a tendency to overreact and this can bring us much danger , " the eu commissioner said . german farmers also concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : concerns are growing that chicken filets can not be exported although the occurrence of the h5n1 strain in france is the only one thus far on an eu domestic farm , germany 's farming association , dbv , fears export bans taken against its western neighbor could unjustifiably be carried over to germany and the eu as a whole . the dbv 's spokesman michael lohse told the weekly tagesspiegel am sonntag that the eu is frequently viewed as a single entity .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

" if someone told me this morning i 'd win a third goal medal i 'd have said ' that would be great ' because i was actually feeling pretty tired before the race , " greis told german television . earlier in the games , greis also won the 20-km individual event , and claimed gold after anchoring the german team to top podium spot in the 4x7.5-km relay . on saturday , greis completed the five gruelling circuits of the 3-km san sicario course in 47 minutes and 20.0 seconds , 6.3 seconds ahead of tomasz sikora of poland , and 12.3 seconds in front of ole einar bjoerndalen of norway .

i came into the olympics in good shape and focused .
i 'm very happy . " bjoerndalen paid the price for missing three targets , two in his last visit to the range , after leading for much of the race in cold , snowy conditions .

" i was forced to make the most of the situation when i knew gold was impossible , " he said . the early part of the race became a duel between sikora and bjoerndalen , winner of five gold medals in the 1998 nagano and 2002 games . the norwegian , who had already picked up two silvers this time around in the pursuit and individual events , led after the first three visits to the shooting range but fell to third place after the fourth shooting test . greis , however , kept his nerve and took the lead from sikora shortly after the fourth shoot and maintained his advantage through to the finish . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin read more stories from the winter olympics in turin in this dw-world.de dossier soldier-athletes lead germany to medals germany has already clinched some 18 medals at the winter olympics underway in turin .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .
künast expected no surprises from the party 's rank-and-file . fdp to decide in march the change of heart should be greeted warmly by the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
one month ago , the fdp along with the left party had wanted to start an inquiry but the greens wavered and voted against the motion in parliament . in the current bundestag , a parliamentary inquiry can only be formed if all three opposition parties agree .
with the greens ' change of heart , this seems more likely .
the left party has already repeated their calls from earlier for an investigation .
the fdp has called a party caucus for march 7 to debate the motion . should the liberals join the ranks of their two opposition partners , politicians from the former and current government will have to answer to their fellow parliamentarians in the investigating committee . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany admits spies gave intelligence to us in iraq war two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war but did not help select bombing targets , a government report released late on thursday found .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .
mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .
since then schalke have n't lost .
and the royal blues won again against ten man nuremberg on goals by kevin kuranyi and lincoln .
all of sudden , schalke are in the running for a possible champions league spot , just two points back of hamburg who have a game in hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's per mertesacker -lrb- l -rrb- and wolfburg 's mike hanke tug for possession hanover also have been enjoying the fruits of a coaching change , not losing since peter neururer was given the job in october .
wolfsburg ended that streak with a 2-1 win at home .
juan carlos menseguez scored the game-winner for the wolves in the 85th minute . in the final saturday game , bielefeld rüdiger kauf 's first-half injury-time goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over dortmund . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga respectable on international stage germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .
mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .
since then schalke have n't lost .
and the royal blues won again against ten man nuremberg on goals by kevin kuranyi and lincoln .
all of sudden , schalke are in the running for a possible champions league spot , just two points back of hamburg who have a game in hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's per mertesacker -lrb- l -rrb- and wolfburg 's mike hanke tug for possession hanover also have been enjoying the fruits of a coaching change , not losing since peter neururer was given the job in october .
wolfsburg ended that streak with a 2-1 win at home .
juan carlos menseguez scored the game-winner for the wolves in the 85th minute . in the final saturday game , bielefeld rüdiger kauf 's first-half injury-time goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over dortmund . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga respectable on international stage germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

some 11,000 turkeys have now been culled ; politicians are repeatedly urging the public not to panic . french president jacques chirac was informed that the h5n1 strain of the avian flu virus had been confirmed at a commercial poultry farm near lyon just hours before he was supposed to inaugurate an annual agriculture show in paris . around 11,000 turkeys had to be slaughtered while the farmer and five family members were given tamiflu as a precaution .
in addition , the family was taken to a nearby hospital and put under quarantine . nevertheless , chirac appealed to the french press not to create an atmosphere of alarm .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .

mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .

wolfsburg ended that streak with a 2-1 win at home .
juan carlos menseguez scored the game-winner for the wolves in the 85th minute . in the final saturday game , bielefeld rüdiger kauf 's first-half injury-time goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over dortmund . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga respectable on international stage germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .
künast expected no surprises from the party 's rank-and-file . fdp to decide in march the change of heart should be greeted warmly by the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
one month ago , the fdp along with the left party had wanted to start an inquiry but the greens wavered and voted against the motion in parliament . in the current bundestag , a parliamentary inquiry can only be formed if all three opposition parties agree .
with the greens ' change of heart , this seems more likely .
the left party has already repeated their calls from earlier for an investigation .
the fdp has called a party caucus for march 7 to debate the motion . should the liberals join the ranks of their two opposition partners , politicians from the former and current government will have to answer to their fellow parliamentarians in the investigating committee . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany admits spies gave intelligence to us in iraq war two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war but did not help select bombing targets , a government report released late on thursday found .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .
künast expected no surprises from the party 's rank-and-file . fdp to decide in march the change of heart should be greeted warmly by the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
one month ago , the fdp along with the left party had wanted to start an inquiry but the greens wavered and voted against the motion in parliament . in the current bundestag , a parliamentary inquiry can only be formed if all three opposition parties agree .
with the greens ' change of heart , this seems more likely .
the left party has already repeated their calls from earlier for an investigation .
the fdp has called a party caucus for march 7 to debate the motion . should the liberals join the ranks of their two opposition partners , politicians from the former and current government will have to answer to their fellow parliamentarians in the investigating committee . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany admits spies gave intelligence to us in iraq war two german spies in baghdad provided intelligence to the us military during the iraq war but did not help select bombing targets , a government report released late on thursday found .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .
mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .
since then schalke have n't lost .
and the royal blues won again against ten man nuremberg on goals by kevin kuranyi and lincoln .
all of sudden , schalke are in the running for a possible champions league spot , just two points back of hamburg who have a game in hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's per mertesacker -lrb- l -rrb- and wolfburg 's mike hanke tug for possession hanover also have been enjoying the fruits of a coaching change , not losing since peter neururer was given the job in october .
wolfsburg ended that streak with a 2-1 win at home .
juan carlos menseguez scored the game-winner for the wolves in the 85th minute . in the final saturday game , bielefeld rüdiger kauf 's first-half injury-time goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over dortmund . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga respectable on international stage germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup .

24 , 2006 -rrb- the 2005/2006 bundesliga season the winners and losers may seems easy to keep straight for the moment , but as more goals are shot some teams are sure to stumble while others take their place in the limelight .
bayern 's arrogance irks bundesliga having all but added the german championship to their trophy case , bayern munich 's domestic matches are little more than distractions in their champions league quest - it 's a situation other managers are n't happy with .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

the left party has already repeated their calls from earlier for an investigation .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .
mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .
since then schalke have n't lost .
and the royal blues won again against ten man nuremberg on goals by kevin kuranyi and lincoln .
all of sudden , schalke are in the running for a possible champions league spot , just two points back of hamburg who have a game in hand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanover 's per mertesacker -lrb- l -rrb- and wolfburg 's mike hanke tug for possession hanover also have been enjoying the fruits of a coaching change , not losing since peter neururer was given the job in october .
wolfsburg ended that streak with a 2-1 win at home .
juan carlos menseguez scored the game-winner for the wolves in the 85th minute . in the final saturday game , bielefeld rüdiger kauf 's first-half injury-time goal gave his side a 1-0 victory over dortmund . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga respectable on international stage germany 's bundesliga teams cut a good figure on the international stage this week , with schalke 04 and hamburg winning to advance to the next stage of the uefa cup .

" if someone told me this morning i 'd win a third goal medal i 'd have said ' that would be great ' because i was actually feeling pretty tired before the race , " greis told german television . earlier in the games , greis also won the 20-km individual event , and claimed gold after anchoring the german team to top podium spot in the 4x7.5-km relay . on saturday , greis completed the five gruelling circuits of the 3-km san sicario course in 47 minutes and 20.0 seconds , 6.3 seconds ahead of tomasz sikora of poland , and 12.3 seconds in front of ole einar bjoerndalen of norway . " surprised " " i was kind of surprised , " said greis .
" to be going home with three golds is a great result for me .
i came into the olympics in good shape and focused .
i 'm very happy . " bjoerndalen paid the price for missing three targets , two in his last visit to the range , after leading for much of the race in cold , snowy conditions . " i 'm a little disappointed with my result , " the norwegian said , adding that he was still happy to be leaving the games with two silvers and a bronze to his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athletes in action during the mens 15-km mass start biathlon event sikora , who finished fifth in the mass start at last year 's world championships , picked up only one penalty loop - which takes top male biathletes around 22 seconds to complete . the 32-year-old pole said he knew it was a question of going for silver after greis took control in the race for the finish line , with bjoerndalen only 24 seconds behind . " i was forced to make the most of the situation when i knew gold was impossible , " he said . the early part of the race became a duel between sikora and bjoerndalen , winner of five gold medals in the 1998 nagano and 2002 games . the norwegian , who had already picked up two silvers this time around in the pursuit and individual events , led after the first three visits to the shooting range but fell to third place after the fourth shooting test . greis , however , kept his nerve and took the lead from sikora shortly after the fourth shoot and maintained his advantage through to the finish . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de winter olympics in turin read more stories from the winter olympics in turin in this dw-world.de dossier soldier-athletes lead germany to medals germany has already clinched some 18 medals at the winter olympics underway in turin .

a government report on the activities of two german spies in baghdad during the iraq war has not served to quell controversy about to what extent they aided the us .
instead , it has raised more questions than it answered . being on the parliamentary control commission in the german bundestag has its advantages .
the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

the political bickering over the activities of two german spies in baghdad just days before and during the united states-led invasion of iraq in 2003 is growing louder but in parliament , not all mps are equal . those sitting on the parliamentary control commission were privy to the complete content of a 300-page report that included details of the activities of two federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- agents , but only 90 pages were released to the rest of parliament and hence to the eyes of the media , causing an outcry from lawmakers from the ruling coalition . social democratic parliamentarian olaf scholz attacked the man behind the condensed version of the report , the commissioner for data privacy peter schaar , accusing him of having too much of a " civil servant mentality . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us troops storm a bridge in baghdad schaar defended his work however , telling the berlin daily tagesspiegel that the information struck from the original document was of a personal nature such as " the health of the people , real or presumed political views or information from current state prosecutor investigations . " greens reconsider inquiry meanwhile , politicians from germany 's opposition parties have rejected the government 's view that the report exonerates the bnd and the administration of former chancellor gerhard schröder . the green party , which was the junior coalition partner with the social democrats under former chancellor gerhard schröder when the iraq war broke out , has decided that a parliamentary inquiry would now best serve the interests of the people . renate künast , the party parliamentary floor leader , said on german public television there are still many matters that must be cleared up regarding what and how much information was passed on to the us by the two bnd agents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast has given voice to the greens ' change of heart " only then will we have all the facts and only then can we pass judgment , " künast said . yet she did not want to commit to having prominent green party member and former foreign minister joschka fischer , appear in front of the inquiry . nevertheless , the party 's leadership approved a call for an investigation on friday that must now be confirmed by the whole of the green party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.02.2006 bayern win like champs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two-man wrecking crew : michael ballack -lrb- r -rrb- and pablo guerrero after a frustrating champions league draw last week , bayern munich unleashed their offensive prowess against frankfurt .
bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .

bremen kept pace with two early goals against gladbach while schalke keep their run going . the expectations of the sellout crowd at bayern munich 's allianz arena on saturday were nothing less than a convincing victory after their beloved side only managed a 1-1 draw against ac milan in the champions league on tuesday . those expectations and more were fulfilled as bayern dismantled a hard-fighting but outclassed team from frankfurt 5-2 . 69,000 fans watched an entertaining match that saw the home side go up after 21 minutes when paolo guerrero took a mishit ball from frankfurt defender alexander vasoski and deposited the ball past goalkeeper oka nikolov .
ten minutes later , however , the visitors knotted the score on a beautiful banana kick from christoph preuss . germany midfielder michael ballack responded just 17 seconds later with the go-ahead goal and guerrero found the net again before half .
ballack and pizarro scored in the second half for the hosts while alexander meier 's goal made the loss not look so bad . " we still had a little bit of anger from tuesday .
the left without a doubt that they want to win the title as quickly as possible , " was coach felix magath 's assessment after the match . bremen win easily bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivan klasnic is heads above kasey keller for bremen 's 2-0 lead miroslav klose was back on the pitch again for werder bremen in a bundesliga match since injuring his shoulder in january .
the international striker was back in form quickly against mönchengladbach . the head-strong klose scored in just that matter in the 16th minute on a cross from playmaker johan micoud - his league-leading 17th goal .
fellow striker ivan klasnic doubled the lead ten minutes later , a lead that was never threatened by harmless gladbach . the win leaves bremen in second-place nine points back of bayern . derbies in carnival bastions top relegation battles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach hanspeter latour is still winless in cologne last-place cologne were hoping that they could warm up the carnival atmosphere that will dominate in the next few days in their derby against cross-river rival leverkusen .
yet after a disappointing 3-0 defeat , only the rose monday parade can lift the spirits of cologne 's supporters .
leverkusen 's strikers , dimitar berbatov and andriy voronin , have been silent of late , but struck in the second half along with jacek krzynowek . in another carnival bastion , mainz , the recent poor play of jürgen klopp 's boys - only one win in the second leg - has led them into the deeper regions of the table .
kaiserslautern , only weeks ago written off as a certain second-division candidate for next season , have played inspired soccer of late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern 's boubacar sanogo from ivory coast -lrb- r -rrb- beats his man and mainz that continued on saturday on the back of boubacar sanogo .
like last week against bielefeld , he scored twice and has single-handedly dragged the red devils out of the relegation zone , dispatching mainz into that oh-so dangerous territory . schalke red hot new coach , new luck .
mirko slomka took over the reins from ralf rangnick in the winter break .
since then schalke have n't lost .
and the royal blues won again against ten man nuremberg on goals by kevin kuranyi and lincoln .

" we think that , over time , we really can create an enormous amount of pressure with this index , " said christoph bals , executive director of germanwatch .
" it will be an incentive for those countries which are the frontrunners , and it will be a strong way of creating pressure on those countries which are at the back of this index to do better in the future . " the index is the result of calculating three different values : the current trend in a country 's greenhouse gas emissions , in which the emissions of the transport , construction , industry , and energy sectors are measured ; the base indicator measuring the amount of carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere per person and per energy unit used ; and the country 's climate change policies - the laws and financial incentives implemented to reduce emissions levels and improve energy efficiency .
the expected results of these policies are also included in the calculation .
the outcome is a more informed , multi-faceted assessment of each country 's emissions-reducing performance and potential . surprising results bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , freiburg is known for its commitment to renewable energy forms such as hydopower the index 's initial findings surprised even some top experts in the field , such as hartmut grassl , former director of both the world climate research program and the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg . " when you integrate the trends and the policy-making aspect , then the result is a rearrangement of the typical ranking we saw up until now , " said grassl .
" previously , we always saw who had most emissions per capita , or as an entire country .
now you have an index which includes the recent trends plus the climate policy in the international arena . " the index puts germany in fifth place overall out of the 53 nations included in the comparison .
the united states was number 52 , ahead of only saudi arabia , while the top three nations were iceland , latvia , and great britain .
the latter has traditionally not been seen as a leader in climate protection , as its emissions levels , rather than falling , are at a standstill .
on the other hand , china proved to be better than previously thought , due to its strong focus on utilizing renewable energy technologies . despite being a forerunner in the development and application of renewable energy technologies , the index showed that germany is not among the top nations when it comes to all aspects of climate protection .
it may have been the only industrialized nation to have achieved a slight decrease in transport emissions -lrb- fourth place -rrb- , but in the building sector , germany 's heating requirements resulted in a lowly 31st place .
and in terms of energy trends , the current german government is considering both building new coal-burning energy plants , and prolonging the lifespan of its nuclear power plants .
these issues , along with developments in renewable energies , will be on the table at a national energy summit in april , where germanwatch plans to present their new index . " germany has a good chance of improving its ranking , " said jan burck of germanwatch .
" we have the technology and we have the policies .
but i think a big part of our country is looking at economic development , and that 's why i 'm afraid of germany 's development when it comes to emissions .
if you have so-called bigger problems , then climate change is often ignored , which means emissions could increase . " drastic action needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global warming and extreme weather conditions will most affect developing nations some of the index 's findings make clear the need for drastic action .
for example , if the industrial world and the developing world fail to cut emissions by 80 and 50 percent respectively before 2050 , scientists predict the average global temperature will rise by two degrees centigrade - something that is expected to cause unprecedented climatic changes . as developing countries are most likely to be affected by this , grassl is hopeful that they will be the ones to step up political pressure on industrialized nations .
he says that economic incentives such as emissions-trading and the production of renewable energy for export markets can make climate protection financially attractive to third-world nations , and play a significant role in getting those nations on board in the fight to reduce emissions worldwide . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german study questions eco-friendliness of plants the protective qualities of plants against the effects of air pollution have been called into question by a german study that says that while they absorb pollutants , they also release methane gas .

here , men take home on average 23 percent more pay than women . the 2006 equality report issued by the european commission on friday contained sobering statistics for germany 's working women .
in 2004 , german men earned on average 23 percent more money than women for equal work - meaning that the pay gap between the sexes is now over three percentage points greater in germany than in the past . statistics from 1999 showed a pay gap of just under 20 percent in germany .
in the same five-year period , the eu average pay gap narrowed by one percentage point , to 15 percent . the eu commission said that despite positive trends in women 's participation in the workforce , the pay gap showed there was still much work to be done on the gender equality front throughout the bloc . " unacceptably high " the pay gap is lowest in malta , italy , portugal , slovenia , greece and poland , and highest in cyprus , slovakia , estonia , the uk , finland , and germany . " the pay gap between women and men remains at unacceptably high levels and shows no significant signs of being closed , " the commission said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says it plans to make it easier for women to combine work and family commitments the commission said it plans to adopt a road map with concrete actions member states should consider in order to improve gender equality . one of the key elements of this road map will be work-life balance measures , which aim to make it easier for men and women to reconcile their personal and professional lives by providing better access to child care , and equal opportunities for both mothers and fathers to take parental leave . however , the commission 's social policy spokeswoman , katharina von schnurbein , argued that social policies alone will not be enough , adding that a different mindset unbiased by gender stereotypes would have to become more common before real change could occur . " some studies show that while the eu has better social policy than the us , more american women are employed and more of them work in higher positions , " schnurbein said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank sex discrimination lawsuits are commonplace in the us , but a german bank finds itself at the center of the latest headline-grabbing action .

the statement said the attack at the oil-processing plant at abqaiq was part of al-qaeda 's campaign to force " infidels " out of the peninsula .
the saudi government has said it foiled the attack and output was not affected .
the al-qaeda network on the arabian peninsula has long called for attacks on saudi oil installations .

oil ' pillage ' friday 's attempt at abqaiq , near the eastern city of dammam , was foiled when guards opened fire on at least two cars carrying explosives as they tried to ram the gates .
at least one of the vehicles blew up , killing the occupants .
two of the guards were killed , and another two were wounded , saudi officials reported .
al-qaeda 's apparent claim of responsibility was made on a website often used by militants , but could not be verified .
its operatives had succeeded in entering the plant with two car bombs , the statement said .
the attack was " part of the project to rid the arabian peninsula of the infidels " and was intended to stop the " pillage of oil wealth " from muslims .
pipeline flowing saudi oil minister ali al-nuaimi said output at the facility , which handles about two-thirds of the country 's oil production , was unaffected by the attack .
he denied earlier reports on al-arabiya television that the attacks had briefly stopped the flow of oil after a pipeline was damaged .
an interior ministry statement said damage had been " limited to a small fire which was brought under control " .
oil is processed at the facility to remove gas and render it less volatile .
saudi arabia has been fighting islamic militants in the country for the past three years .
attackers have previously targeted oil company offices and compounds housing westerners , while saudi security forces have killed dozens of insurgents .

it is thought to be the last local authority in the uk without political groups , and the move is expected to prompt other parties to form .
the labour group claimed the group system would be more accountable .
but other councillors said party politics would interfere with the smooth running of the council .
since 1974 , councillors ' independence has meant they have not had to toe a party line when voting .
some council members claim this non-confrontational approach has made for transparent debate and clarity , and is the envy of other local authorities .
i 've been a councillor for 32 years and i find it very sad liberal democrat gareth morgan but the leader of the council 's labour group sandra davies disagreed .
labour 's decision could prompt the liberal democrats to form their own band of up to 24 members , but the independent councillors will be the majority .
however , it remains to be seen if they , the conservatives or plaid cymru decide to form their own groups .
there are 73 councillors in all .
mrs davies , who has been a powys councillor for 18 months , gave her reasons for altering the political landscape in powys .
she said : " we intend to declare after the meeting .
" we think the council would be more accountable and more efficiently run if it had political groups .
" powys is an enormous county and i represent a ward -lrb- cwmtwrch -rrb- in the ystradgynlais area -lrb- near swansea -rrb- .
' ruling elite ' " people there feel out on a limb and on the edge of the county .
all the labour councillors are from that area and we feel we can be more accountable to our constituents by forming a group . "
liberal democrat councillor gareth morgan , who sits on the council 's ruling board , is against politicisation .
he said : " when i was chairman of the council a few years ago and met colleagues from other local authorities from wales , it was significant that they envied the system in powys where everyone worked together .
" they liked that we did not let political parties interfere with policy and that meetings were transparent .
" i 've been a councillor for 32 years and i find it very sad - it will be the end of an era .
i am very reluctant to take any step that will introduce any groups - my heart is not in it . "
conservative mid and west wales am glyn davies said it seemed " inevitable " that the council would alter , but at least there would be " genuine opposition " to the " ruling elite " , he added .
he said : " i have an emotional attachment to the idea of a wholly ' independent ' council where councillors are answerable to the constituents rather than to their political groups . "
the local government association said it believed powys was the last remaining non-political authority in the uk .

it is thought to be the last local authority in the uk without political groups , and the move is expected to prompt other parties to form .
the labour group claimed the group system would be more accountable .
but other councillors said party politics would interfere with the smooth running of the council .
since 1974 , councillors ' independence has meant they have not had to toe a party line when voting .
some council members claim this non-confrontational approach has made for transparent debate and clarity , and is the envy of other local authorities .
i 've been a councillor for 32 years and i find it very sad liberal democrat gareth morgan but the leader of the council 's labour group sandra davies disagreed .
labour 's decision could prompt the liberal democrats to form their own band of up to 24 members , but the independent councillors will be the majority .
however , it remains to be seen if they , the conservatives or plaid cymru decide to form their own groups .
there are 73 councillors in all .
mrs davies , who has been a powys councillor for 18 months , gave her reasons for altering the political landscape in powys .
she said : " we intend to declare after the meeting .
" we think the council would be more accountable and more efficiently run if it had political groups .
" powys is an enormous county and i represent a ward -lrb- cwmtwrch -rrb- in the ystradgynlais area -lrb- near swansea -rrb- .
' ruling elite ' " people there feel out on a limb and on the edge of the county .
all the labour councillors are from that area and we feel we can be more accountable to our constituents by forming a group . "
liberal democrat councillor gareth morgan , who sits on the council 's ruling board , is against politicisation .
he said : " when i was chairman of the council a few years ago and met colleagues from other local authorities from wales , it was significant that they envied the system in powys where everyone worked together .
" they liked that we did not let political parties interfere with policy and that meetings were transparent .
" i 've been a councillor for 32 years and i find it very sad - it will be the end of an era .
i am very reluctant to take any step that will introduce any groups - my heart is not in it . "
conservative mid and west wales am glyn davies said it seemed " inevitable " that the council would alter , but at least there would be " genuine opposition " to the " ruling elite " , he added .
he said : " i have an emotional attachment to the idea of a wholly ' independent ' council where councillors are answerable to the constituents rather than to their political groups . "
the local government association said it believed powys was the last remaining non-political authority in the uk .

the recommendations were made at a three-day international conference in cambridgeshire , uk .
the researchers hope the measures will enable international collaboration . "

the delegates have now formed the hinxton group , an interdisciplinary consortium on stem cell ethics and law , which will meet regularly to further discuss these issues .
" stem cell research is an area constantly under a microscope , in terms of the public 's interest in it , " said professor ruth faden , a bioethicist at johns hopkins university , us , and a member of the hinxton group .
" at the same time , scientists are very concerned to conduct themselves in an ethically responsible way , and it 's not clear always how to do that in the face of conflicting laws . "
international ethical codes recommendations the group propose include : getting journals to ask researchers to include statements confirming their research conforms to national guidelines a public website for international researchers to share information about research codes and ethical protocols an attempt to reach an international ethical consensus on new areas of research , including the creation of human-animal chimeras " across the world there are some countries with very restrictive legislation like germany , and there are some countries with very vague policies like china , " said professor julian savulescu , an ethicist at oxford university , and a member of the newly formed group .
" in essence , articulating ethical standards will enable scientists to collaborate internationally . "
the conference brought into sharp focus many of the issues raised by the recent south korean stem cell scandal .
an investigation found researcher hwang woo-suk had " intentionally fabricated " his work on cloning and human embryonic stem cells .
he was also accused of using unethical means to obtain eggs for his group 's studies .

the rise was attributed to more peak time weekday traffic and an increase in the number of heavy goods vehicles .
the latest statistics are being seen as particularly significant as the bridge is already carrying more than twice the load it was designed to handle .
meanwhile , work to upgrade a8000 link road between the bridge and the m8 and m9 is due to start in june .
the bridge operators have awarded a £ 40m contract to morrison construction and the project should be finished in february 2008 . "
the increasing number of heavy vehicles is particularly significant as these cause the greatest damage to the fabric of the bridge itself " alastair andrew feta general manager most of the road will be improved to motorway standard , with the aim of reducing congestion for southbound bridge traffic during the morning rush hour .
the board has also approved a feasibility study into reducing the rate of corrosion in the bridge 's main support cables .
the move follows a report which warned the bridge could be shut to all traffic in under 14 years unless action was taken .
consultants are to look into fitting £ 12m de-humidification equipment , which would pump dry air onto the wet cables .
ministers are due to discuss bridge tolls and the possibility of building a new crossing when they meet next week .
alastair andrew , forth estuary transport association -lrb- feta -rrb- general manager , said : " although the traffic figures for 2004 and 2005 were distorted by the major works being carried out on the bridge at that time , the underlying trend is clear - demand for travel across the forth continues to grow .
" the increasing number of heavy vehicles is particularly significant as these cause the greatest damage to the fabric of the bridge itself .
" this is already resulting in an increasingly frequent need to resurface the bridge and strengthen the structure , which is already carrying more than twice its original design capacity . "
' traffic exaggeration ' " this is already resulting in an increasingly frequent need to resurface the bridge and strengthen the structure , which is already carrying more than twice its original design capacity . "
a spokesman for the national alliance against tolls scotland said claims of a rise in traffic were " just spin " .
john mcgoldrick said : " traffic on the forth road bridge is only counted northbound .
" in 2005 there were 11,905,000 northbound crossings .
this was up on 2004 , but was actually down 100,000 on the figure for 2003 .
" as for the a8000 / m9 spur , drivers may wonder why this £ 40m scheme is being financed from bridge tolls , rather than from the £ 4bn that is collected in roads taxes from scotland 's drivers . "
