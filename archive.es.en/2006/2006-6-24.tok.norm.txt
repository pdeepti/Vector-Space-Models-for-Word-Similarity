sweden goalkeeper andreas isaksson stopped him in his tracks but the ball fell kindly to podolski and his shot went in off the hapless lucic . it was podolski 's second goal in a row and the third was not long in coming . in the 12th minute podolski , who will play on this ground for bayern munich next season , accepted a pass from klose and curled a left-footed shot in for 2-0 . german goalkeeper jens lehmann had hardly made a save in his first three matches but was called into action to stop a smart turn and shot by ibrahimovic . eight minutes into the second half sweden were then handed a lifeline when larsson was felled by christoph metzelder in the penalty area . but larsson , winning his 93rd cap , hammered his spot-kick over the crossbar to the dismay of the sweden fans . germany captain michael ballack then saw a fantastic drive tipped onto the post .
ballack was left shooting at will and could have had a hat-trick but he was left still searching for his first goal at these finals . sweden created chances but with their numerical disadvantage they never looked like overturning a buoyant germany . the home fans left the turnstiles in high spirits as their team continue to ride the world cup wave . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : germany 2:0 sweden review all the action as it happened with dw-world 's liver ticker .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 24.06.2006 do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry ca n't believe it took france eight years to win a world cup match either they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

isaksson in the swedish goal rushes out and saves but podolski is there to pick up and shoots the ball into the net .
6. min .
podolski fires away .
the shot leaves the striker 's foot just outside the box but goes about half a meter over the crossbar .
11. min .
goal germany ! ! ! ! 11. min .
what a start for the germans .
klose and podolski combine along the swedish boxline and make the swedish defense look like blind sheep .
klose gets the ball over to podolski who fires his second goal home .
15. min .
the germans own the game .
the swedes are shocked and keep hitting long balls that go nowhere .
in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .
isaksson should be glad he 's almost two meters tall .
20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .
lucic booked after a late challenge on klose .
29. min .
the swedes are too slow and keep losing the ball whenever they try to play their way to the german box .
31. min .
that 's close !
lahm goes into the box down at the endline and quickly moves past his defender to serve klose .
the striker does n't get full power behind his shot and isaksson can push the ball to a corner .
34. min .
lucic is out ! !
a tough decision by the brazilian ref .
38. min .
kallstrom leaves for hansson .
the swedish coach has to react to lucic 's red card and brings on a new defender .
39. min .
first swedish chance on goal !
ibrahimovic gets the ball in the middle of the box , turns and shoots .
lehmann struggles in the right corner of his goal but gets the ball away .
42. min .
another good chance for the swedes as larsson hits a cross into jonson .
lehmann rushes out a bit late but saves with a kick .
45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .
49. min .
it looks as if the germans have decided to take it a bit easier and go for the counter .
but it could be temporary .
50. min .
yes it is .
again the swedes are doing nothing to prevent the germans from taking over and play their way into the swedish half .
51. min .
penalty for sweden ! 52. min .
jonson leaves for wilhelmson before the penalty .
52. min .
larsson misses the kick from the spot !
the swedish striker hits it hard and high over the goal .
54. min .
great save by the swedish keeper .
ballack hits a great shot from twenty five meters which the swedish keeper gets a hand on .
he tips the ball onto the post and out ! 56. min .
the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .
64. min .
another beautiful build up by the germans .
klose nutmegs hansson , passes ballack who touches the ball along .
luckily a swedish foot is there .
66. min .
friedrich is one of many in the german team to try a shot from distance .
have the germans started practicing for the quarter final ? 68. min .
frings is lying outside the box after a ball hit his face .
70. min .
lahm loses the ball at the midline .
it is one of few german mistakes today .
the awaited swedish counter attack has the speed of a road kill hamster .
72. min .
schweinsteiger leaves for borowski 72. min .
ibrahimovic goes for allback .
73. min .
podolski gives way for neuville 74. min .
borowski 's first touch is a foot on the ball in the swedish box .
the unlucky german seems to have gotten injured trying to score and is carried out on a stretcher .
76. min .
borowski is back on the pitch .
77. min .
allback 's first action is to get booked ! 78. min .
since the swedes have no energy to build anything , the germans seem to think they might as well try to score another .
ballack hits a weird , bouncing and twisting ball from within the box .
it is not far from the swedish net .
80. min .
ballack 's canon .
the german captain fires away a shot from twenty five meters that echoes between the stands .
the swedish keeper , best man of his team , saves but it must have hurt .
82. min .
there is a break in the game as edman licks his wounds .
84. min .
schneider hits the post .
after yet another lovely combination by the germans schneider get to be the one to shoot .
the ball deflects on a swedish leg and hits the post .
84. min .
frings leaves for kehl .
86. min .
isaksson , the goalie , is the only swedish player who fights and he does it well .
great save again as the germans are trying their best to humiliate the scandinavians .
88. min .
the last twenty minutes will be one of the darkest moments in swedish soccer history .
the team has given up and will have to go home in shame .
not for losing but for not trying .
90 + 1. min .
when will this end ?
let the germans begin their celebrations ! 90 + 3. min .
germany have beaten the swedes to go on to the quarter finals .
a german performance that will build respect for what is to come .
the swedes on the other hand showed what it looks like when talent just is n't there .
the germans were never threatened and will now go into the last eight full of confidence .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .

in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .

when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .

twelve minutes to go .
the stadium in munich is packed with german and swedish fans .
a rumour has it all the bavarian city 's beer taps have been emptied by the yellow and blue fans flooding the streets in their plastic viking helmets .
the players are lined up in the corridor .
players march in .
a warm welcome both from the stands and from the blue skies .
the anthems are being sung .
1. min .
sweden kick-off .
1. min .
free-kick for sweden .
1. min .
edman hits the free-kick into the box but the german defense are first on the ball .
3. min .
goal germany ! ! ! 4. min .
a long ball reaches klose just outside the box .
the german striker combines with podolski and comes through .
isaksson in the swedish goal rushes out and saves but podolski is there to pick up and shoots the ball into the net .
6. min .
podolski fires away .
the shot leaves the striker 's foot just outside the box but goes about half a meter over the crossbar .
11. min .
goal germany ! ! ! ! 11. min .
what a start for the germans .
klose and podolski combine along the swedish boxline and make the swedish defense look like blind sheep .
klose gets the ball over to podolski who fires his second goal home .
15. min .
the germans own the game .
the swedes are shocked and keep hitting long balls that go nowhere .
in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .
isaksson should be glad he 's almost two meters tall .
20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .
lucic booked after a late challenge on klose .
29. min .
the swedes are too slow and keep losing the ball whenever they try to play their way to the german box .
31. min .
that 's close !
lahm goes into the box down at the endline and quickly moves past his defender to serve klose .
the striker does n't get full power behind his shot and isaksson can push the ball to a corner .
34. min .
lucic is out ! !
a tough decision by the brazilian ref .
38. min .
kallstrom leaves for hansson .
the swedish coach has to react to lucic 's red card and brings on a new defender .
39. min .
first swedish chance on goal !
ibrahimovic gets the ball in the middle of the box , turns and shoots .
lehmann struggles in the right corner of his goal but gets the ball away .
42. min .
another good chance for the swedes as larsson hits a cross into jonson .
lehmann rushes out a bit late but saves with a kick .
45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .
49. min .
it looks as if the germans have decided to take it a bit easier and go for the counter .
but it could be temporary .
50. min .
yes it is .
again the swedes are doing nothing to prevent the germans from taking over and play their way into the swedish half .
51. min .
penalty for sweden ! 52. min .
jonson leaves for wilhelmson before the penalty .
52. min .
larsson misses the kick from the spot !
the swedish striker hits it hard and high over the goal .
54. min .
great save by the swedish keeper .
ballack hits a great shot from twenty five meters which the swedish keeper gets a hand on .
he tips the ball onto the post and out ! 56. min .
the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .

goal germany ! ! ! ! 11. min .
what a start for the germans .
klose and podolski combine along the swedish boxline and make the swedish defense look like blind sheep .
klose gets the ball over to podolski who fires his second goal home .
15. min .
the germans own the game .
the swedes are shocked and keep hitting long balls that go nowhere .
in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .
isaksson should be glad he 's almost two meters tall .
20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .
lucic booked after a late challenge on klose .
29. min .
the swedes are too slow and keep losing the ball whenever they try to play their way to the german box .
31. min .
that 's close !
lahm goes into the box down at the endline and quickly moves past his defender to serve klose .
the striker does n't get full power behind his shot and isaksson can push the ball to a corner .
34. min .
lucic is out ! !
a tough decision by the brazilian ref .

lehmann struggles in the right corner of his goal but gets the ball away .
42. min .
another good chance for the swedes as larsson hits a cross into jonson .
lehmann rushes out a bit late but saves with a kick .
45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .
49. min .
it looks as if the germans have decided to take it a bit easier and go for the counter .
but it could be temporary .
50. min .
yes it is .
again the swedes are doing nothing to prevent the germans from taking over and play their way into the swedish half .

54. min .
great save by the swedish keeper .
ballack hits a great shot from twenty five meters which the swedish keeper gets a hand on .
he tips the ball onto the post and out ! 56. min .
the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .
64. min .
another beautiful build up by the germans .
klose nutmegs hansson , passes ballack who touches the ball along .
luckily a swedish foot is there .
66. min .
friedrich is one of many in the german team to try a shot from distance .
have the germans started practicing for the quarter final ? 68. min .
frings is lying outside the box after a ball hit his face .
70. min .
lahm loses the ball at the midline .
it is one of few german mistakes today .
the awaited swedish counter attack has the speed of a road kill hamster .
72. min .
schweinsteiger leaves for borowski 72. min .
ibrahimovic goes for allback .
73. min .
podolski gives way for neuville 74. min .
borowski 's first touch is a foot on the ball in the swedish box .
the unlucky german seems to have gotten injured trying to score and is carried out on a stretcher .
76. min .
borowski is back on the pitch .
77. min .
allback 's first action is to get booked ! 78. min .
since the swedes have no energy to build anything , the germans seem to think they might as well try to score another .
ballack hits a weird , bouncing and twisting ball from within the box .
it is not far from the swedish net .
80. min .
ballack 's canon .
the german captain fires away a shot from twenty five meters that echoes between the stands .
the swedish keeper , best man of his team , saves but it must have hurt .
82. min .
there is a break in the game as edman licks his wounds .
84. min .
schneider hits the post .
after yet another lovely combination by the germans schneider get to be the one to shoot .
the ball deflects on a swedish leg and hits the post .
84. min .
frings leaves for kehl .
86. min .
isaksson , the goalie , is the only swedish player who fights and he does it well .
great save again as the germans are trying their best to humiliate the scandinavians .
88. min .
the last twenty minutes will be one of the darkest moments in swedish soccer history .
the team has given up and will have to go home in shame .
not for losing but for not trying .
90 + 1. min .
when will this end ?
let the germans begin their celebrations ! 90 + 3. min .
germany have beaten the swedes to go on to the quarter finals .
a german performance that will build respect for what is to come .
the swedes on the other hand showed what it looks like when talent just is n't there .
the germans were never threatened and will now go into the last eight full of confidence .

mexico aim to reach the quarter-finals for the first time away from home . mexico knew they were likely to beat iran and angola to advance to the round of 16 behind portugal but would have a difficult time in the knock-out stage and have nothing to lose against argentina . mexico 's coach talked up their chances against argentina after booking a second-round meeting with the new world cup favorites . mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said a different mexico would take the field on saturday in leipzig than the one that scrambled into the second round after defeat by portugal . " they 're going to be much more at ease and that will help them to score goals , " he said .

" we 've got the forwards , we put the opposition goal under pressure but we need to persist and see if we can get more positive results . " favored to beat mexico , argentina also need a positive result to continue winning over after booking a 8-1 goal difference .
their stellar 6-0 drubbing of serbia and montenegro and disappointing scoreless draw against the netherlands in the group phase have raised some questions about argentina 's chances against mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina want to get back to scoring goals teams have 50-50 chance " mexico are always able to score goals , " argentina coach jose pekerman said .
" they are technically skilled and highly competitive team .
no team can ever believe that mexico is not a strong rival . " argentina defender roberto ayala said he 'd put even odds on the game . " mexico have the same chances as us , " he said .
" they have made matters difficult for us the previous times they have played argentina .
we 'll try to prevent them from being comfortable on the ball and when we attack attempt the variety of options we have showed up to now . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground .

no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .
all of the host cities - 12 in total - have organized a so-called " fan fest " : official public viewings along with a supporting program of music , shows and cultural events . " in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans that could not get their hands on a ticket , " said oc president franz beckenbauer . bri n gi n g together the soccer commu n ity public viewing events gained a reputation for the first time at the 2002 world cup in korea and japan .
some 2.8 billion people around the world followed the 64 games in public squares , halls and bars .
fifa said it expected around 30 percent of the german population to follow the games at this world cup via public viewing , plus hundreds of thousands of foreign guests . back in 1930 , soccer fans had to crowd around the radio to hear the reports from the first world cup in uruguay .
although the 1936 summer olympics in berlin were televised and marked the first television coverage of a sports happening in the world , radio continued to be the medium used to follow international sporting events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can we see that goal again ?
the world cup in soccer was first televised in 1954 .
with the introduction of television into more people 's homes after world war ii , listeners became viewers .
in some countries , not everyone had a television , so they would be carried out into the street so that entire neighborhoods could watch .
this is still the case in many developing countries today .
the community atmosphere was also felt at local pubs or cafes , once they introduced television . in germany , many fans have decided to get up off their sofas and follow the world cup games on big screens in public viewing areas or on television in beer gardens , pubs and any other place offering a television set . reve n ue goes to charity the official organizers of the fan fests are not fifa or the oc - even if the official tournament sponsors are represented for refinancing reasons - but the host cities themselves or agencies contracted by them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these english fans in cologne did n't only leave good spirits behind , but also litter " there is a certain budget for all the host cities to work with , " said simone winkelhog , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , which had a lot of cleaning up to do after the england-sweden game on tuesday . the swiss company infront sport & media , owned by german soccer legend günther netzer , handles the global sales of all the broadcast rights for the 2006 world cup and is also responsible for the host broadcast . " we decided at an early stage to agree on a special rule for the commercial public viewings in all 12 host cities and to provide these with free licences , " netzer said .
" this is a gesture to the cities , which are making a vital contribution to the success of the world cup , and above all to the fans and visitors . " other commercial events , for example those that charge viewers for a spot in front of the screen , require a license .
according to infront , all revenues raised from commercial license sales will be donated to the charity sos children 's villages and the official charity campaign of the 2006 world cup , " six villages for 2006 . " more than 800 towns and communities also registered non-commercial events with infront .
pubs and beer gardens in germany do n't have to pay any license fees to broadcast the matches . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de england fans score a goal for good behavior at world cup a few years ago the sight of 70,000 england fans descending on germany would have triggered panic among security officials .

millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .
all of the host cities - 12 in total - have organized a so-called " fan fest " : official public viewings along with a supporting program of music , shows and cultural events . " in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans that could not get their hands on a ticket , " said oc president franz beckenbauer . bri n gi n g together the soccer commu n ity public viewing events gained a reputation for the first time at the 2002 world cup in korea and japan .
some 2.8 billion people around the world followed the 64 games in public squares , halls and bars .
fifa said it expected around 30 percent of the german population to follow the games at this world cup via public viewing , plus hundreds of thousands of foreign guests . back in 1930 , soccer fans had to crowd around the radio to hear the reports from the first world cup in uruguay .
although the 1936 summer olympics in berlin were televised and marked the first television coverage of a sports happening in the world , radio continued to be the medium used to follow international sporting events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can we see that goal again ?
the world cup in soccer was first televised in 1954 .
with the introduction of television into more people 's homes after world war ii , listeners became viewers .
in some countries , not everyone had a television , so they would be carried out into the street so that entire neighborhoods could watch .
this is still the case in many developing countries today .
the community atmosphere was also felt at local pubs or cafes , once they introduced television . in germany , many fans have decided to get up off their sofas and follow the world cup games on big screens in public viewing areas or on television in beer gardens , pubs and any other place offering a television set . reve n ue goes to charity the official organizers of the fan fests are not fifa or the oc - even if the official tournament sponsors are represented for refinancing reasons - but the host cities themselves or agencies contracted by them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these english fans in cologne did n't only leave good spirits behind , but also litter " there is a certain budget for all the host cities to work with , " said simone winkelhog , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , which had a lot of cleaning up to do after the england-sweden game on tuesday . the swiss company infront sport & media , owned by german soccer legend günther netzer , handles the global sales of all the broadcast rights for the 2006 world cup and is also responsible for the host broadcast . " we decided at an early stage to agree on a special rule for the commercial public viewings in all 12 host cities and to provide these with free licences , " netzer said .
" this is a gesture to the cities , which are making a vital contribution to the success of the world cup , and above all to the fans and visitors . " other commercial events , for example those that charge viewers for a spot in front of the screen , require a license .
according to infront , all revenues raised from commercial license sales will be donated to the charity sos children 's villages and the official charity campaign of the 2006 world cup , " six villages for 2006 . " more than 800 towns and communities also registered non-commercial events with infront .

the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country . piotr farfal has had a stellar career .
the 28-year-old pole is a lawyer .
he is also a far-right political activist , a card-carrying right-wing extremist and former editor-in-chief of the polish skinhead magazine fro n t , which openly supports anti-semitism and right-wing extremist violence . and now he has been appointed as deputy chairman of the board of poland 's state-run public television .
people are wondering how this could have happened - even in a country such as poland that is going through dramatic social and political change . farfal , however , has powerful friends in high places .
among them is the leader of the right-wing league of polish families , roman giertych , who is also poland 's deputy prime minister and education minister in the country 's new government .
it was giertych that got farfal his appointment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski of the law and justice party is a ' family values ' leader farfal says he does n't understand all the fuss . " of course , you can make a scandal out of it today , " he said .
" you can say he 's 28 years old and responsible for his actions when he was 16 .
okay , but where are the limits of absurdity ?
i was a snotty-nosed kid , who let his name be used .
so , i ask again , where are the limits to absurdity ? " youthful ig n ora n ce ? but the question is whether it was really just youthful ignorance .
people are wondering if that is a suitable explanation for articles such as " why be a skinhead , " which appeared with his byline in the april 1995 issue of fro n t magazine .
" we do not accept cowards , collaborators or jews , " he wrote in the article .
" we are the future ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 and has run up against european human rights conventions in other european countries , the author of such diatribes would find himself investigated by state prosecutors and security services .
in poland , he gets appointed to a top post on state television , said marcin kornak , a civil rights activist . " sixty years ago , people with these kinds of views murdered seven million people in our country , " he said .
" this person , therefore , has no right whatsoever to hold such an important post in this society as deputy chairman of polish television . " growi n g rightwi n g se n time n t i n pola n d recently , the european parliament in strasbourg passed a resolution condemning the growing signs of racism and anti-semitism in poland and elsewhere .
the accusations were vehemently denied by poland 's new governing coalition of populist and nationalist conservatives , the law and justice party and the league of polish families , who are themselves often viewed as xenophobic and ultraconservative .
president lech kaczynski , elected last fall , strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage . but the pressure is mounting against farfal .
the chairman of the culture committee in the polish parliament , pawel kowal , has left no doubt that he will put farfal 's appointment on the agenda of polish television 's supervisory board and the country 's national media council . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

mexico aim to reach the quarter-finals for the first time away from home . mexico knew they were likely to beat iran and angola to advance to the round of 16 behind portugal but would have a difficult time in the knock-out stage and have nothing to lose against argentina . mexico 's coach talked up their chances against argentina after booking a second-round meeting with the new world cup favorites . mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said a different mexico would take the field on saturday in leipzig than the one that scrambled into the second round after defeat by portugal .

" our main problem is scoring - we even had a penalty which we missed , " lavolpe said .

" they have made matters difficult for us the previous times they have played argentina .
we 'll try to prevent them from being comfortable on the ball and when we attack attempt the variety of options we have showed up to now . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground .

riot police held 378 english soccer fans on saturday night after they clashed with german supporters and threw bottles , tables and chairs in a square in the city center , where germans had watched their team 's 2-0 victory over sweden on giant tv screens . " i do n't consider these people to be english football supporters because they actually damage the reputation of the many thousands of real english supporters that will be here today , " stephen thomas , the head of the british police team working in germany , told reuters on sunday .
police said 122 supporters were taken into protective custody friday night for aggressive behavior .
many fans had been drinking alcohol for most of the day .

stuttgart police will have 1,900 police on duty to prevent any incidents with another 4,000 deployed throughout the federal state of baden-württemberg .

" any hooligans would have left after the fifth police warning , " he told britain 's press association . mostly good behavior police said the english fans were in a good mood for most of the day but became aggressive as the evening wore on and began hurling objects .

riot police held 378 english soccer fans on saturday night after they clashed with german supporters and threw bottles , tables and chairs in a square in the city center , where germans had watched their team 's 2-0 victory over sweden on giant tv screens . " i do n't consider these people to be english football supporters because they actually damage the reputation of the many thousands of real english supporters that will be here today , " stephen thomas , the head of the british police team working in germany , told reuters on sunday .
police said 122 supporters were taken into protective custody friday night for aggressive behavior .
many fans had been drinking alcohol for most of the day .

" from a security point of view , we have n't increased the security level of the game between england and ecuador , " said an ok spokesperson .
" it remains at a middle level like the games before it , which is normal . "
stuttgart police will have 1,900 police on duty to prevent any incidents with another 4,000 deployed throughout the federal state of baden-württemberg .
police spokesman erwin hetger refused to rule out clashes between english and " problem " german fans but said security officials had no indication that there had been any mobilization of hooligans .
" any hooligans would have left after the fifth police warning , " he told britain 's press association . mostly good behavior police said the english fans were in a good mood for most of the day but became aggressive as the evening wore on and began hurling objects .
" we had to move in because there was a danger of passers-by getting injured , " said a police spokesman .
police said most of those detained would be released during the course of saturday , while a magistrate would examine the most serious cases .

sweden goalkeeper andreas isaksson stopped him in his tracks but the ball fell kindly to podolski and his shot went in off the hapless lucic . it was podolski 's second goal in a row and the third was not long in coming . in the 12th minute podolski , who will play on this ground for bayern munich next season , accepted a pass from klose and curled a left-footed shot in for 2-0 . german goalkeeper jens lehmann had hardly made a save in his first three matches but was called into action to stop a smart turn and shot by ibrahimovic . eight minutes into the second half sweden were then handed a lifeline when larsson was felled by christoph metzelder in the penalty area . but larsson , winning his 93rd cap , hammered his spot-kick over the crossbar to the dismay of the sweden fans . germany captain michael ballack then saw a fantastic drive tipped onto the post .
ballack was left shooting at will and could have had a hat-trick but he was left still searching for his first goal at these finals . sweden created chances but with their numerical disadvantage they never looked like overturning a buoyant germany . the home fans left the turnstiles in high spirits as their team continue to ride the world cup wave . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : germany 2:0 sweden review all the action as it happened with dw-world 's liver ticker .

twelve minutes to go .
the stadium in munich is packed with german and swedish fans .
a rumour has it all the bavarian city 's beer taps have been emptied by the yellow and blue fans flooding the streets in their plastic viking helmets .
the players are lined up in the corridor .
players march in .
a warm welcome both from the stands and from the blue skies .
the anthems are being sung .

in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .

20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .

45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .

the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .
64. min .
another beautiful build up by the germans .
klose nutmegs hansson , passes ballack who touches the ball along .
luckily a swedish foot is there .
66. min .

frings is lying outside the box after a ball hit his face .

no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .
all of the host cities - 12 in total - have organized a so-called " fan fest " : official public viewings along with a supporting program of music , shows and cultural events . " in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans that could not get their hands on a ticket , " said oc president franz beckenbauer . bri n gi n g together the soccer commu n ity public viewing events gained a reputation for the first time at the 2002 world cup in korea and japan .
some 2.8 billion people around the world followed the 64 games in public squares , halls and bars .
fifa said it expected around 30 percent of the german population to follow the games at this world cup via public viewing , plus hundreds of thousands of foreign guests . back in 1930 , soccer fans had to crowd around the radio to hear the reports from the first world cup in uruguay .
although the 1936 summer olympics in berlin were televised and marked the first television coverage of a sports happening in the world , radio continued to be the medium used to follow international sporting events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can we see that goal again ?
the world cup in soccer was first televised in 1954 .
with the introduction of television into more people 's homes after world war ii , listeners became viewers .
in some countries , not everyone had a television , so they would be carried out into the street so that entire neighborhoods could watch .
this is still the case in many developing countries today .
the community atmosphere was also felt at local pubs or cafes , once they introduced television . in germany , many fans have decided to get up off their sofas and follow the world cup games on big screens in public viewing areas or on television in beer gardens , pubs and any other place offering a television set . reve n ue goes to charity the official organizers of the fan fests are not fifa or the oc - even if the official tournament sponsors are represented for refinancing reasons - but the host cities themselves or agencies contracted by them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these english fans in cologne did n't only leave good spirits behind , but also litter " there is a certain budget for all the host cities to work with , " said simone winkelhog , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , which had a lot of cleaning up to do after the england-sweden game on tuesday . the swiss company infront sport & media , owned by german soccer legend günther netzer , handles the global sales of all the broadcast rights for the 2006 world cup and is also responsible for the host broadcast . " we decided at an early stage to agree on a special rule for the commercial public viewings in all 12 host cities and to provide these with free licences , " netzer said .
" this is a gesture to the cities , which are making a vital contribution to the success of the world cup , and above all to the fans and visitors . " other commercial events , for example those that charge viewers for a spot in front of the screen , require a license .
according to infront , all revenues raised from commercial license sales will be donated to the charity sos children 's villages and the official charity campaign of the 2006 world cup , " six villages for 2006 . " more than 800 towns and communities also registered non-commercial events with infront .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .

the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country . piotr farfal has had a stellar career .
the 28-year-old pole is a lawyer .
he is also a far-right political activist , a card-carrying right-wing extremist and former editor-in-chief of the polish skinhead magazine fro n t , which openly supports anti-semitism and right-wing extremist violence . and now he has been appointed as deputy chairman of the board of poland 's state-run public television .
people are wondering how this could have happened - even in a country such as poland that is going through dramatic social and political change . farfal , however , has powerful friends in high places .
among them is the leader of the right-wing league of polish families , roman giertych , who is also poland 's deputy prime minister and education minister in the country 's new government .
it was giertych that got farfal his appointment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski of the law and justice party is a ' family values ' leader farfal says he does n't understand all the fuss . " of course , you can make a scandal out of it today , " he said .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.06.2006 germans stop humming , start singing national anthem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singing it loud , singing it proud most national anthems are at least a little politically incorrect by today 's standards , and germany 's is no worse than other countries ' .
so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .

the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country . piotr farfal has had a stellar career .
the 28-year-old pole is a lawyer .
he is also a far-right political activist , a card-carrying right-wing extremist and former editor-in-chief of the polish skinhead magazine fro n t , which openly supports anti-semitism and right-wing extremist violence . and now he has been appointed as deputy chairman of the board of poland 's state-run public television .
people are wondering how this could have happened - even in a country such as poland that is going through dramatic social and political change . farfal , however , has powerful friends in high places .
among them is the leader of the right-wing league of polish families , roman giertych , who is also poland 's deputy prime minister and education minister in the country 's new government .
it was giertych that got farfal his appointment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski of the law and justice party is a ' family values ' leader farfal says he does n't understand all the fuss . " of course , you can make a scandal out of it today , " he said .
" you can say he 's 28 years old and responsible for his actions when he was 16 .
okay , but where are the limits of absurdity ?
i was a snotty-nosed kid , who let his name be used .
so , i ask again , where are the limits to absurdity ? " youthful ig n ora n ce ? but the question is whether it was really just youthful ignorance .
people are wondering if that is a suitable explanation for articles such as " why be a skinhead , " which appeared with his byline in the april 1995 issue of fro n t magazine .
" we do not accept cowards , collaborators or jews , " he wrote in the article .
" we are the future ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 and has run up against european human rights conventions in other european countries , the author of such diatribes would find himself investigated by state prosecutors and security services .
in poland , he gets appointed to a top post on state television , said marcin kornak , a civil rights activist . " sixty years ago , people with these kinds of views murdered seven million people in our country , " he said .
" this person , therefore , has no right whatsoever to hold such an important post in this society as deputy chairman of polish television . " growi n g rightwi n g se n time n t i n pola n d recently , the european parliament in strasbourg passed a resolution condemning the growing signs of racism and anti-semitism in poland and elsewhere .
the accusations were vehemently denied by poland 's new governing coalition of populist and nationalist conservatives , the law and justice party and the league of polish families , who are themselves often viewed as xenophobic and ultraconservative .
president lech kaczynski , elected last fall , strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage . but the pressure is mounting against farfal .
the chairman of the culture committee in the polish parliament , pawel kowal , has left no doubt that he will put farfal 's appointment on the agenda of polish television 's supervisory board and the country 's national media council . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration .

riot police held 378 english soccer fans on saturday night after they clashed with german supporters and threw bottles , tables and chairs in a square in the city center , where germans had watched their team 's 2-0 victory over sweden on giant tv screens . " i do n't consider these people to be english football supporters because they actually damage the reputation of the many thousands of real english supporters that will be here today , " stephen thomas , the head of the british police team working in germany , told reuters on sunday .
police said 122 supporters were taken into protective custody friday night for aggressive behavior .
many fans had been drinking alcohol for most of the day .
" we gave them a yellow card and after that , just like in soccer , we showed them red , " said a police spokesman .
of the 378 held on saturday night , 375 have been released , but told they are banned from returning to the city center .

" from a security point of view , we have n't increased the security level of the game between england and ecuador , " said an ok spokesperson .
" it remains at a middle level like the games before it , which is normal . "

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .

until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .

despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .

twelve minutes to go .
the stadium in munich is packed with german and swedish fans .
a rumour has it all the bavarian city 's beer taps have been emptied by the yellow and blue fans flooding the streets in their plastic viking helmets .
the players are lined up in the corridor .
players march in .
a warm welcome both from the stands and from the blue skies .
the anthems are being sung .
1. min .
sweden kick-off .
1. min .
free-kick for sweden .
1. min .
edman hits the free-kick into the box but the german defense are first on the ball .
3. min .
goal germany ! ! ! 4. min .
a long ball reaches klose just outside the box .
the german striker combines with podolski and comes through .
isaksson in the swedish goal rushes out and saves but podolski is there to pick up and shoots the ball into the net .
6. min .
podolski fires away .
the shot leaves the striker 's foot just outside the box but goes about half a meter over the crossbar .
11. min .
goal germany ! ! ! ! 11. min .
what a start for the germans .
klose and podolski combine along the swedish boxline and make the swedish defense look like blind sheep .
klose gets the ball over to podolski who fires his second goal home .
15. min .
the germans own the game .
the swedes are shocked and keep hitting long balls that go nowhere .
in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .
isaksson should be glad he 's almost two meters tall .
20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .
lucic booked after a late challenge on klose .
29. min .
the swedes are too slow and keep losing the ball whenever they try to play their way to the german box .
31. min .
that 's close !
lahm goes into the box down at the endline and quickly moves past his defender to serve klose .
the striker does n't get full power behind his shot and isaksson can push the ball to a corner .

lucic is out ! !
a tough decision by the brazilian ref .

lehmann rushes out a bit late but saves with a kick .
45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .
49. min .

great save by the swedish keeper .
ballack hits a great shot from twenty five meters which the swedish keeper gets a hand on .
he tips the ball onto the post and out ! 56. min .
the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .

luckily a swedish foot is there .

frings is lying outside the box after a ball hit his face .
70. min .

schweinsteiger leaves for borowski 72. min .
ibrahimovic goes for allback .
73. min .
podolski gives way for neuville 74. min .
borowski 's first touch is a foot on the ball in the swedish box .
the unlucky german seems to have gotten injured trying to score and is carried out on a stretcher .
76. min .
borowski is back on the pitch .
77. min .
allback 's first action is to get booked ! 78. min .
since the swedes have no energy to build anything , the germans seem to think they might as well try to score another .
ballack hits a weird , bouncing and twisting ball from within the box .
it is not far from the swedish net .
80. min .
ballack 's canon .
the german captain fires away a shot from twenty five meters that echoes between the stands .
the swedish keeper , best man of his team , saves but it must have hurt .
82. min .
there is a break in the game as edman licks his wounds .

great save again as the germans are trying their best to humiliate the scandinavians .
88. min .
the last twenty minutes will be one of the darkest moments in swedish soccer history .
the team has given up and will have to go home in shame .
not for losing but for not trying .
90 + 1. min .
when will this end ?
let the germans begin their celebrations ! 90 + 3. min .
germany have beaten the swedes to go on to the quarter finals .

twelve minutes to go .
the stadium in munich is packed with german and swedish fans .
a rumour has it all the bavarian city 's beer taps have been emptied by the yellow and blue fans flooding the streets in their plastic viking helmets .
the players are lined up in the corridor .
players march in .
a warm welcome both from the stands and from the blue skies .
the anthems are being sung .
1. min .
sweden kick-off .
1. min .
free-kick for sweden .
1. min .
edman hits the free-kick into the box but the german defense are first on the ball .
3. min .
goal germany ! ! ! 4. min .

the german striker combines with podolski and comes through .
isaksson in the swedish goal rushes out and saves but podolski is there to pick up and shoots the ball into the net .
6. min .

goal germany ! ! ! ! 11. min .
what a start for the germans .
klose and podolski combine along the swedish boxline and make the swedish defense look like blind sheep .
klose gets the ball over to podolski who fires his second goal home .
15. min .
the germans own the game .
the swedes are shocked and keep hitting long balls that go nowhere .
in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .
isaksson should be glad he 's almost two meters tall .
20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .
if the tempo is a bit slower at the moment , it 's because the german 's want it that way .
the swedes are nothing but extras in this game .
27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .
lucic booked after a late challenge on klose .
29. min .
the swedes are too slow and keep losing the ball whenever they try to play their way to the german box .
31. min .
that 's close !

lucic is out ! !
a tough decision by the brazilian ref .

lehmann rushes out a bit late but saves with a kick .
45 + 1. min .
the last minutes again the germans have done pretty much what they felt like with the swedish defense .
the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .
45. min .
second half is on .
46. min .
the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .
47. min .
jonson gets booked after an ice-hockey tackle on ballack .
49. min .
it looks as if the germans have decided to take it a bit easier and go for the counter .

54. min .
great save by the swedish keeper .
ballack hits a great shot from twenty five meters which the swedish keeper gets a hand on .
he tips the ball onto the post and out ! 56. min .
the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .
64. min .
another beautiful build up by the germans .
klose nutmegs hansson , passes ballack who touches the ball along .
luckily a swedish foot is there .
66. min .
friedrich is one of many in the german team to try a shot from distance .
have the germans started practicing for the quarter final ? 68. min .
frings is lying outside the box after a ball hit his face .
70. min .
lahm loses the ball at the midline .
it is one of few german mistakes today .
the awaited swedish counter attack has the speed of a road kill hamster .
72. min .
schweinsteiger leaves for borowski 72. min .
ibrahimovic goes for allback .
73. min .
podolski gives way for neuville 74. min .
borowski 's first touch is a foot on the ball in the swedish box .
the unlucky german seems to have gotten injured trying to score and is carried out on a stretcher .
76. min .
borowski is back on the pitch .
77. min .
allback 's first action is to get booked ! 78. min .
since the swedes have no energy to build anything , the germans seem to think they might as well try to score another .
ballack hits a weird , bouncing and twisting ball from within the box .
it is not far from the swedish net .
80. min .
ballack 's canon .
the german captain fires away a shot from twenty five meters that echoes between the stands .
the swedish keeper , best man of his team , saves but it must have hurt .
82. min .
there is a break in the game as edman licks his wounds .
84. min .
schneider hits the post .
after yet another lovely combination by the germans schneider get to be the one to shoot .
the ball deflects on a swedish leg and hits the post .
84. min .
frings leaves for kehl .
86. min .
isaksson , the goalie , is the only swedish player who fights and he does it well .
great save again as the germans are trying their best to humiliate the scandinavians .
88. min .
the last twenty minutes will be one of the darkest moments in swedish soccer history .
the team has given up and will have to go home in shame .
not for losing but for not trying .
90 + 1. min .
when will this end ?
let the germans begin their celebrations ! 90 + 3. min .
germany have beaten the swedes to go on to the quarter finals .
a german performance that will build respect for what is to come .
the swedes on the other hand showed what it looks like when talent just is n't there .
the germans were never threatened and will now go into the last eight full of confidence .

no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .
all of the host cities - 12 in total - have organized a so-called " fan fest " : official public viewings along with a supporting program of music , shows and cultural events . " in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans that could not get their hands on a ticket , " said oc president franz beckenbauer . bri n gi n g together the soccer commu n ity public viewing events gained a reputation for the first time at the 2002 world cup in korea and japan .
some 2.8 billion people around the world followed the 64 games in public squares , halls and bars .
fifa said it expected around 30 percent of the german population to follow the games at this world cup via public viewing , plus hundreds of thousands of foreign guests . back in 1930 , soccer fans had to crowd around the radio to hear the reports from the first world cup in uruguay .
although the 1936 summer olympics in berlin were televised and marked the first television coverage of a sports happening in the world , radio continued to be the medium used to follow international sporting events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can we see that goal again ?
the world cup in soccer was first televised in 1954 .
with the introduction of television into more people 's homes after world war ii , listeners became viewers .
in some countries , not everyone had a television , so they would be carried out into the street so that entire neighborhoods could watch .
this is still the case in many developing countries today .
the community atmosphere was also felt at local pubs or cafes , once they introduced television . in germany , many fans have decided to get up off their sofas and follow the world cup games on big screens in public viewing areas or on television in beer gardens , pubs and any other place offering a television set . reve n ue goes to charity the official organizers of the fan fests are not fifa or the oc - even if the official tournament sponsors are represented for refinancing reasons - but the host cities themselves or agencies contracted by them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these english fans in cologne did n't only leave good spirits behind , but also litter " there is a certain budget for all the host cities to work with , " said simone winkelhog , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , which had a lot of cleaning up to do after the england-sweden game on tuesday . the swiss company infront sport & media , owned by german soccer legend günther netzer , handles the global sales of all the broadcast rights for the 2006 world cup and is also responsible for the host broadcast . " we decided at an early stage to agree on a special rule for the commercial public viewings in all 12 host cities and to provide these with free licences , " netzer said .
" this is a gesture to the cities , which are making a vital contribution to the success of the world cup , and above all to the fans and visitors . " other commercial events , for example those that charge viewers for a spot in front of the screen , require a license .

the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country . piotr farfal has had a stellar career .
the 28-year-old pole is a lawyer .
he is also a far-right political activist , a card-carrying right-wing extremist and former editor-in-chief of the polish skinhead magazine fro n t , which openly supports anti-semitism and right-wing extremist violence . and now he has been appointed as deputy chairman of the board of poland 's state-run public television .
people are wondering how this could have happened - even in a country such as poland that is going through dramatic social and political change . farfal , however , has powerful friends in high places .
among them is the leader of the right-wing league of polish families , roman giertych , who is also poland 's deputy prime minister and education minister in the country 's new government .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

the stadium in munich is packed with german and swedish fans .
a rumour has it all the bavarian city 's beer taps have been emptied by the yellow and blue fans flooding the streets in their plastic viking helmets .
the players are lined up in the corridor .
players march in .
a warm welcome both from the stands and from the blue skies .
the anthems are being sung .

15. min .
the germans own the game .

in fifteen minutes the swedes have had one attempt at goal .
17. min .
ballack fires a shot from twenty meters .
the germans can do what they feel like inside the swedish half .
this time schweinsteiger finds ballack who does not hesitate .

20. min .
first decent swedish chance .
larsson is almost through but the ball is kicked out to a corner in the last second .
23. min .
schneider is the next german to try a shot .
it goes wide but not all that much .
25. min .

27. min .
frings sees the card after his handling earlier .
27. min .

the result has been a couple of nice combinations and shots at goal .
45 + 2. min .
first half is over .
two teams - one goal .
germany are playing their best game of the tournament and sweden have little to put up against wave after wave of attacks .
the scandinavians look like a division four team who accidentally were herded into a world cup stadium .

the swedes combine their way through the german defense and lehmann has to dive in and take the heat to stop the swedish attack .

the tempo is slower than in the first half which means the swedes are allowed to play a bit of ball as well .
58. min .
can the swedish team come back after having missed their chance to equalize ?
it is unlikely as the germans keep playing their stunning combinations with ease .
61. min .
podolski and klose combine their way into the swedish box again .
klose crosses but podolski , for once , is blocked this time by a swedish defender .
63. min .
the swedes are jumping around in panic trying to head away the ball as it gets closer to the box .

76. min .
borowski is back on the pitch .
77. min .
allback 's first action is to get booked ! 78. min .
since the swedes have no energy to build anything , the germans seem to think they might as well try to score another .
ballack hits a weird , bouncing and twisting ball from within the box .
it is not far from the swedish net .
80. min .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 24.06.2006 do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry ca n't believe it took france eight years to win a world cup match either they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

retailers and breweries are attributing their growing gains to the soccer championship . since the first whistle sounded , the cash registers have been cha-chinging in fan centers at the german stadiums .

a real collectors ' frenzy has developed .
the biggest hit is the hawaiian leis , " said jens halverscheid , who runs a flag stand in downtown dortmund .
the top seller at another souvenir stand was flags for the car at three euros -lrb- $ 3.79 -rrb- a piece . rivers of beer it 's no surprise that beer is the preferred thirst quencher of soccer fans .
" we definitely expect our sales to double during the world cup , " predicted georg schaefer , manager of a private brewery .
slightly less optimistic , individual retailers in cologne expect sales increases of 20 percent . with 19,000 hectoliters -lrb- 501,927 gallons -rrb- , the veltins brewery set an output record last friday and monday .
in may , the krombacher brewery had the best month in the history of the company with 600,000 hectoliters -lrb- 15.85 million gallons -rrb- .

" the classic souvenirs are selling just as well as everything else that 's even remotely related to soccer , " said pangels . increases in the sale of hobby and sports articles have also been observed .
notably , it 's the german fans that are consuming and not only the international fans , as had been expected . sellers of other products , however , are n't doing the same kind of victory dance . according to the trade association , business is going well at the distribution centers .
on the other hand , extended shopping hours have not brought in more customers .
pangels said the association expects a revenue increase of two million euros .
the farther the german team gets , the more the expectations grow . voices of criticism but not everyone has soaring spirits and high hopes .

sweden goalkeeper andreas isaksson stopped him in his tracks but the ball fell kindly to podolski and his shot went in off the hapless lucic . it was podolski 's second goal in a row and the third was not long in coming . in the 12th minute podolski , who will play on this ground for bayern munich next season , accepted a pass from klose and curled a left-footed shot in for 2-0 . german goalkeeper jens lehmann had hardly made a save in his first three matches but was called into action to stop a smart turn and shot by ibrahimovic . eight minutes into the second half sweden were then handed a lifeline when larsson was felled by christoph metzelder in the penalty area . but larsson , winning his 93rd cap , hammered his spot-kick over the crossbar to the dismay of the sweden fans . germany captain michael ballack then saw a fantastic drive tipped onto the post .
ballack was left shooting at will and could have had a hat-trick but he was left still searching for his first goal at these finals . sweden created chances but with their numerical disadvantage they never looked like overturning a buoyant germany . the home fans left the turnstiles in high spirits as their team continue to ride the world cup wave . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de live ticker : germany 2:0 sweden review all the action as it happened with dw-world 's liver ticker .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .

mexico aim to reach the quarter-finals for the first time away from home . mexico knew they were likely to beat iran and angola to advance to the round of 16 behind portugal but would have a difficult time in the knock-out stage and have nothing to lose against argentina . mexico 's coach talked up their chances against argentina after booking a second-round meeting with the new world cup favorites . mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said a different mexico would take the field on saturday in leipzig than the one that scrambled into the second round after defeat by portugal . " they 're going to be much more at ease and that will help them to score goals , " he said .
" we start with a clean sheet , it 's 0-0 with no advantage to either side , and we play for 90 minutes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mexicans will have to show a lot of strength to top argentia scoring mexico 's main problem lavolpe 's biggest worry will be the profligacy of his strikers .
he admitted his disbelief after omar bravo , a two-goal hero against iran , wasted a series of good chances , but the return of the country 's leading scorer jared borgetti could bring new life into the offense . " our main problem is scoring - we even had a penalty which we missed , " lavolpe said .
" we 've got the forwards , we put the opposition goal under pressure but we need to persist and see if we can get more positive results . " favored to beat mexico , argentina also need a positive result to continue winning over after booking a 8-1 goal difference .
their stellar 6-0 drubbing of serbia and montenegro and disappointing scoreless draw against the netherlands in the group phase have raised some questions about argentina 's chances against mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina want to get back to scoring goals teams have 50-50 chance " mexico are always able to score goals , " argentina coach jose pekerman said .
" they are technically skilled and highly competitive team .
no team can ever believe that mexico is not a strong rival . " argentina defender roberto ayala said he 'd put even odds on the game . " mexico have the same chances as us , " he said .
" they have made matters difficult for us the previous times they have played argentina .
we 'll try to prevent them from being comfortable on the ball and when we attack attempt the variety of options we have showed up to now . " mexico have twice been quarter-finalists , but on both occasions , in 1970 and 1986 , it was on home ground .
the winner of the match play either hosts germany or sweden in the quarter-finals . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no goals , but plenty of action in argentine-dutch clash two-time world cup winners argentina reached a goalless draw with the netherlands to finish top of group c in a tight , furiously-paced game in frankfurt on wednesday .
-lrb- june 22 , 2006 -rrb- argentina beat up serbia and montenegro argentina proved why some consider them a world cup title contender , displaying their speed and precision passing in a 6-0 rout of their group c opponents .

the former editor of a polish neo-nazi magazine has been appointed as deputy chairman of poland 's public tv network , sending shockwaves through the new eu member country . piotr farfal has had a stellar career .
the 28-year-old pole is a lawyer .
he is also a far-right political activist , a card-carrying right-wing extremist and former editor-in-chief of the polish skinhead magazine fro n t , which openly supports anti-semitism and right-wing extremist violence . and now he has been appointed as deputy chairman of the board of poland 's state-run public television .
people are wondering how this could have happened - even in a country such as poland that is going through dramatic social and political change . farfal , however , has powerful friends in high places .
among them is the leader of the right-wing league of polish families , roman giertych , who is also poland 's deputy prime minister and education minister in the country 's new government .
it was giertych that got farfal his appointment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president lech kaczynski of the law and justice party is a ' family values ' leader farfal says he does n't understand all the fuss . " of course , you can make a scandal out of it today , " he said .
" you can say he 's 28 years old and responsible for his actions when he was 16 .
okay , but where are the limits of absurdity ?
i was a snotty-nosed kid , who let his name be used .
so , i ask again , where are the limits to absurdity ? " youthful ig n ora n ce ? but the question is whether it was really just youthful ignorance .
people are wondering if that is a suitable explanation for articles such as " why be a skinhead , " which appeared with his byline in the april 1995 issue of fro n t magazine .
" we do not accept cowards , collaborators or jews , " he wrote in the article .
" we are the future ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland joined the eu in 2004 and has run up against european human rights conventions in other european countries , the author of such diatribes would find himself investigated by state prosecutors and security services .
in poland , he gets appointed to a top post on state television , said marcin kornak , a civil rights activist . " sixty years ago , people with these kinds of views murdered seven million people in our country , " he said .
" this person , therefore , has no right whatsoever to hold such an important post in this society as deputy chairman of polish television . " growi n g rightwi n g se n time n t i n pola n d recently , the european parliament in strasbourg passed a resolution condemning the growing signs of racism and anti-semitism in poland and elsewhere .
the accusations were vehemently denied by poland 's new governing coalition of populist and nationalist conservatives , the law and justice party and the league of polish families , who are themselves often viewed as xenophobic and ultraconservative .
president lech kaczynski , elected last fall , strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage . but the pressure is mounting against farfal .
the chairman of the culture committee in the polish parliament , pawel kowal , has left no doubt that he will put farfal 's appointment on the agenda of polish television 's supervisory board and the country 's national media council . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de right-wing extremism in poland gathers momentum after the victory of the national conservatives in last year 's elections , right-wing extremist groupings in poland are gaining influence - as illustrated by a recent attack on a gay and lesbian demonstration .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

mexico aim to reach the quarter-finals for the first time away from home . mexico knew they were likely to beat iran and angola to advance to the round of 16 behind portugal but would have a difficult time in the knock-out stage and have nothing to lose against argentina . mexico 's coach talked up their chances against argentina after booking a second-round meeting with the new world cup favorites . mexico coach ricardo lavolpe said a different mexico would take the field on saturday in leipzig than the one that scrambled into the second round after defeat by portugal . " they 're going to be much more at ease and that will help them to score goals , " he said .
" we start with a clean sheet , it 's 0-0 with no advantage to either side , and we play for 90 minutes . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mexicans will have to show a lot of strength to top argentia scoring mexico 's main problem lavolpe 's biggest worry will be the profligacy of his strikers .
he admitted his disbelief after omar bravo , a two-goal hero against iran , wasted a series of good chances , but the return of the country 's leading scorer jared borgetti could bring new life into the offense . " our main problem is scoring - we even had a penalty which we missed , " lavolpe said .
" we 've got the forwards , we put the opposition goal under pressure but we need to persist and see if we can get more positive results . " favored to beat mexico , argentina also need a positive result to continue winning over after booking a 8-1 goal difference .
their stellar 6-0 drubbing of serbia and montenegro and disappointing scoreless draw against the netherlands in the group phase have raised some questions about argentina 's chances against mexico . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina want to get back to scoring goals teams have 50-50 chance " mexico are always able to score goals , " argentina coach jose pekerman said .
" they are technically skilled and highly competitive team .
no team can ever believe that mexico is not a strong rival . " argentina defender roberto ayala said he 'd put even odds on the game . " mexico have the same chances as us , " he said .
" they have made matters difficult for us the previous times they have played argentina .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 24.06.2006 do n't believe the hype : pre-cup favorites struggle through großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thierry henry ca n't believe it took france eight years to win a world cup match either they arrived brimming with confidence , laden with stars and shouldering expectation .
the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .

but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .

facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .

the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .

france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.06.2006 germans stop humming , start singing national anthem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singing it loud , singing it proud most national anthems are at least a little politically incorrect by today 's standards , and germany 's is no worse than other countries ' .
so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .
the catholic church has welcomed a " commitment to our country . "

in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .

national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .

writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .

tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

so why does it still send a chill down the spine ? " do you hum it , or do you sing it ? " wondered berlin newspaper bz as the world cup kicked off two weeks ago - and obligingly printed the lyrics for anyone who did n't know the words .
in germany , that 's a lot of people .
unlike just about everyone else in the world , no one in this country learns their national anthem at their mother 's knee .
in fact , " das deutschlandlied " is relatively harmless - one of the world 's only national anthems by a renowned composer and little more than a celebration of " unity , law and freedom . "
compare that to the french " la marseillaise " - " march , march / let impure blood / water our furrows ! " - or lines such as " their blood has wiped out their foul footsteps ' pollution " from " the star spangled banner , " and it looks positively mellow .
but for obvious reasons , germans still balk at references to the fatherland , while the french have no such qualms .
national pride , " nein danke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english fans have never minded making a show of national pride sixty years after world war two , impassioned expressions of patriotic zeal are still largely taboo in germany .
those emotionally charged moments ahead of football games see other teams visibly swelling with pride as their fans bellow along to the " inno di mameli " and " god save the queen . "
but to the germans , the experience has always been inevitably tainted by a nagging awareness that their country long ago forfeited its right to national pride .
but in recent weeks , world cup fever has given rise to a burgeoning sense that maybe it 's ok to be german and proud of it after all .
the sight of the german team standing in the munich stadium , their arms around one another as " das deutschlandlied " played , was a emotional moment for many watching .
against the backdrop of this " positive patriotism , " the education and sciences sector trade union -lrb- gew -rrb- provoked outrage this week when it proposed replacing the hymn 's text with lyrics penned by bertold brecht in the post-war years .
why should n't germans belt out their traditional anthem as heartily as the dutch sing the " wilhelmus " and the swedes " du gamla , du fria " ?
after all , many argue that all that 's needed to demystify the german national anthem is a better look at the context it was written in .
the vagaries of history it was on august 26 , 1841 , that the poet august heinrich hoffmann von fallersleben -lrb- 1798 - 1874 -rrb- wrote " das deutschlandlied " while in exile on helgoland , which then belonged to england .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph haydn the music had been written over forty years ealier by austrian composer joseph haydn -lrb- 1732 - 1809 -rrb- , and was previously set off by leopol haschka lyrics that paid tribute to the austro-hungarian empire .
writing at a time when a unified germany still did not exist , fallersleben , a liberal professor of german literature , would never have guessed how sinister the first lines " germany , germany above all / above everything in the world " would sound to later generations .
a fervent nationalist , his intention was to rally the people together to form a unified germany - a nation " above " the separate states of prussia , austria , saxony and more than 30 others , " from the maas to the memel / from the etsch to the belt . "
tarred by the nazi brush in 1922 , the first president of the weimar republic , friedrich ebert , officially introduced " das deutschlandlied " as the national anthem , complete with an unofficial " fourth stanza " dealing with the postwar situation which was later forgotten .
its fall from grace came after the nazis took power .
during the third reich , the first stanza was used heavily , unlike the second and especially the third , which did not fit the nazi agenda .
in their place was sung the " horst wessel lied , " a song penned by an sa stormtrooper believed to have been killed in a confrontation with communists and subsequently considered a martyr by his fellow nazis .
from then on , the anthem was tarred with the nazi brush , and after the end of world war ii , the newly founded federal republic of germany was at a loss for what to do with the question of a national anthem .
it was n't until 1952 that then chancellor konrad adenauer asked president theodor heuss to " designate the song by hoffmann and haydn the national anthem .
at state functions the third verse should be sung . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german patriotism ever since , germans have been singing the third stanza as the official anthem but with a marked lack of gusto .
now , slowly but surely , " das deutschlandlied " is being reclaimed , and the opening of the world cup might , in retrospect , mark something of a turning point .
it seems that football has done what politics could never do - give a voice to a generation to whom patriotism is not a dirty word . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german politicians hail new patriotism the self-confidence shown by germans at the world cup is an expression of a new and healthy patriotism , according to several politicians .

no problem .
millions of soccer fans across germany are showing that they can have just as much fun watching the world cup games outside of the stadiums . over half a million fans in berlin watched the german team win against ecuador on tuesday along the city 's fan mile and they 're bound to regroup for saturday 's match against sweden - proving that you do n't have to be in the stadium to revel in the charged atmosphere surrounding the duels . tens of thousands of english fans have come across the channel to watch their team 's matches , even without tickets .
the 2-2 draw against sweden on tuesday was just as much fun to watch on the big screen as in cologne 's stadium . for the first time in world cup history , fifa , the organizing committee -lrb- oc -rrb- and the host cities have developed a joint concept to allow fans to experience the month-long excitement of the cup even without a ticket - and for free .
all of the host cities - 12 in total - have organized a so-called " fan fest " : official public viewings along with a supporting program of music , shows and cultural events . " in view of the enormous public interest , we felt an obligation to bring the fifa world cup atmosphere to those fans that could not get their hands on a ticket , " said oc president franz beckenbauer . bri n gi n g together the soccer commu n ity public viewing events gained a reputation for the first time at the 2002 world cup in korea and japan .
some 2.8 billion people around the world followed the 64 games in public squares , halls and bars .
fifa said it expected around 30 percent of the german population to follow the games at this world cup via public viewing , plus hundreds of thousands of foreign guests . back in 1930 , soccer fans had to crowd around the radio to hear the reports from the first world cup in uruguay .
although the 1936 summer olympics in berlin were televised and marked the first television coverage of a sports happening in the world , radio continued to be the medium used to follow international sporting events . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can we see that goal again ?
the world cup in soccer was first televised in 1954 .
with the introduction of television into more people 's homes after world war ii , listeners became viewers .
in some countries , not everyone had a television , so they would be carried out into the street so that entire neighborhoods could watch .
this is still the case in many developing countries today .
the community atmosphere was also felt at local pubs or cafes , once they introduced television . in germany , many fans have decided to get up off their sofas and follow the world cup games on big screens in public viewing areas or on television in beer gardens , pubs and any other place offering a television set . reve n ue goes to charity the official organizers of the fan fests are not fifa or the oc - even if the official tournament sponsors are represented for refinancing reasons - but the host cities themselves or agencies contracted by them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these english fans in cologne did n't only leave good spirits behind , but also litter " there is a certain budget for all the host cities to work with , " said simone winkelhog , spokeswoman for the city of cologne , which had a lot of cleaning up to do after the england-sweden game on tuesday . the swiss company infront sport & media , owned by german soccer legend günther netzer , handles the global sales of all the broadcast rights for the 2006 world cup and is also responsible for the host broadcast . " we decided at an early stage to agree on a special rule for the commercial public viewings in all 12 host cities and to provide these with free licences , " netzer said .
" this is a gesture to the cities , which are making a vital contribution to the success of the world cup , and above all to the fans and visitors . " other commercial events , for example those that charge viewers for a spot in front of the screen , require a license .
according to infront , all revenues raised from commercial license sales will be donated to the charity sos children 's villages and the official charity campaign of the 2006 world cup , " six villages for 2006 . " more than 800 towns and communities also registered non-commercial events with infront .

the big guns flew in ready to blow everyone else away .
so far , only a few have delivered while others have been shooting blanks . the teams that will face each other in the first knock-out round of the world cup are now known .
there are a couple of surprises amongst them , namely australia and ghana , but mostly those teams who were expected to advance have done so . a number of those who have booked their ticket to the last 16 have done so with credible group standings which belie their mediocre performances in the opening stage . so why have the teams which flew into germany with such high hopes and such burgeoning reputations failed to set the world stage alight ? from those who have qualified for the next round , england must be the biggest enigma of them all .
for a team of superstars playing for some of the most high profile european clubs , the performances as a whole border on the incredulous . fielding a midfield which would be the envy of any team in the world and with one of the game 's most exciting young prospects in striker wayne rooney , england should have swept into the last 16 against such opponents as paraguay , trinidad and tobago and sweden .
the truth is the toothless three lions limped into the knock-out stages . while coach sven goran eriksson could not have foreseen the tournament-ending injury to michael owen , he is responsible for england being without adequate striking cover .
he is also responsible for employing tactics which his team find hard to understand and implement . england suffer stage fright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : panic in england 's defense : not an unknown occurance england are a team that takes to the field with supreme confidence .
when they 're winning , it can flow unrestrained .
but shown their own frailties - most painfully obvious in the final group b game against sweden - they are gripped by panic .
as is the coach who is left floundering by a changing game .
england 's hopes at this world cup rest on whether eriksson can keep his head when everyone around him is losing theirs . if england can progress as far as the semi-final , they may meet reigning world champions brazil .
until japan were annihilated 4-1 in the last group f match , brazil were a pale imitation of what a brazilian team should be .
a 1-0 win against croatia , followed by a nervy 2-0 win over australia may have showed that in terms of goals scored , brazil were slowly improving . old guard holding back brazil 's progress ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is one of brazil 's under-performing stars but questions remain .
why does coach carlos alberto parreira insist on playing an attacking full back - roberto carlos - who ca n't run anymore ?
why does the coach keep faith in an obviously overweight and underperforming ronaldo ?
and why does the " magic quartet " only seem to have one magician this time out , namely kaka ? then came the japan game .
ronaldo scores two and suddenly he 's the legend of old .
ronaldinho remembers his passing boots and kaka is no longer the lone sorcerer .
four goals and brazil are back on their pedestal .
but this was against japan ; a team with so many holes in it , it should be sponsored by a sieve manufacturer . physical teams with desire like croatia and australia rattled brazil and literally knocked them out of their rhythm .
a team which plays under intense external pressure , with everyone believing they only have to turn up to win the cup , brazil need to be allowed to play their way to feel good and to perform to that high standard .
in the coming rounds , they will face teams that will restrict their performances .
it will be a measure of this brazil team how they react to that . italy arrived in germany almost unnoticed .
the clamor for the samba stars of brazil , the media glare which follows beckham and co. and the noisy debate over the host nation 's chances were the perfect cover for the azzurri to swoop in with their new attacking mentality to upset the world cup apple cart . and they did , to start with , but more because no-one had noticed that the old defensive tactics of grinding down opponents had been replaced by a new flair bordering on the cavalier .
the surprise that italy had come to the world cup to play immediately had everyone heralding them as potential champions . combustible italy still the practitioners of the dark arts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy battled to an inglorious 1-1 draw against the usa but after the " battle of kaiserslautern " where italy and the united states kicked chunks out of each other and ended up with a 1-1 draw , the cynical side of the italians reminded everyone of their potential to lose control , if not the game .
facing nine-men with 40 minutes left to play , ten-man italy preferred to exact revenge whenever they could rather than go for the win . against the czech republic , they were again handed the advantage of playing a depleted side but still failed to impress despite keeping all their players on the pitch and winning 2-0 .
lack of confidence is not one of the problems the italians have to face ; keeping concentration and maintaining their cool are . and then there is france .
anyone who remembers the summer of 1998 can not fail to have watched old soldiers like zinedine zidane , lillian thuram and fabien barthez laboring through the group stages without shedding inner tears .
france 's world cup triumph on home soil eight years ago was a neutral 's joy .
france 's world cup performance in 2006 is a betrayal of that soccer legacy . french legends hobbled by sated ambition ? les bleus had a team made up of youthful exuberance and a couple of old heads back in ' 98 ; this year , they are an aging team dragged to the finals by fading legends brought out of retirement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zidane the master consoles ribery the pupil the french youth system and academy which produced world cup and european championship winners in successive tournaments surely can not have stopped baring such rich fruit .
and yet , raymond domenech fields a team with bulging trophy cabinets and sated ambition with only 23 year-old winger frank ribery the only obvious glance to the future in his squad selection . the french do n't look to have the stomach for battle this year ; they lack the desire that is obvious in the teams who have progressed with performances that suggest they could be real contenders .
despite a 2-0 win against togo which took them through , the french again looked disinterested at times . the world cup underachievers maintain that it 's important not to peak too early .
this may be true but there is a need to peak at some time if the world cup is to be won .
that 's why germany , spain and argentina - teams which have found the connection between their potential and their performance - look a better proposition than a lot of the teams with big reputations which have now scraped through . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : sweden ca n't put nail in england coffin advancing was n't in the cards for trinidad and tobago after a swedish tie with england and paraguay 's 2-0 win sent england into the knock-out rounds ahead of their scandinavian opponents .

anoma paul , who owns a pontypridd newsagents with her husband , said she did not know anyone when she arrived in wales 22 years ago , but was made to feel at home immediately by the warm welcome she received from valleys residents .
" when i first arrived i was taking a shower when my husband called to me to say some people were there to see me , " said mrs paul .

bikers have said they have been meeting at the bridge for decades .
but a decade ago no-one lived there , now there are hundreds of exclusive riverside flats .
residents said bikers turn the bridge into a racetrack every friday , thundering across until 0300 gmt and the police are not doing enough .
police said they are aware of , and are committed to tackling , the problem . "
we just want some enforcement of some basic laws " murad qureshi mitchell feierstein , of the chelsea bridge wharf tenants association , said : " i believe there 's going to be a huge accident where many people are going to be killed . "
" i 'm not a killjoy ... but i suppose nobody would want this in their own front yard , especially until two or three o 'clock in the morning . "
residents have shot videos of the scooter and motorcycle riders doing stunts and creating a lot of noise as they roar across the bridge .
murad qureshi , a labour member of the london assembly , said the weekly meet was riding roughshod over attempts at traffic calming and increasing road safety .
" we just want some enforcement of some basic laws , " he said .
" this is all happening on a red route over chelsea bridge , it does n't make any sense to have this continue . "
but chris mcclean , manager of supreme riders , said : " i think even the police would agree that the general riding public are law abiding citizens .
" but there are a small group of people who want to show off and are giving the rest of us , unfortunately , a bad name . "
local police said they are aware of " anti-social motorcycling " in the area , but did not want to discuss what their plans to tackle the problem are .

as a result the sentences of the 1,200 inmates on death row will be now be commuted to life imprisonment .
mrs arroyo said she welcomed the change but insists she is not softening her stance on fighting crime or terrorism .
mrs arroyo has been under pressure from the influential roman catholic church to scrap capital punishment .
the signing comes as she prepares to head to rome for an audience with pope benedict xvi .
earlier this month legislators in the philippines , a mainly catholic country , voted overwhelmingly to abolish capital punishment .
by philippine standards the bill was pushed through in record time .
violent crime wave in a speech mrs arroyo said " we yield to the high moral imperative dictated by god to walk away from capital punishment " .
earlier she had assured the public that the end of the death penalty did not mean there would be a soft stance against criminals .
the philippines is plagued by violent crime with guns readily available and used in even minor disputes .
supporters of capital punishment say they fear the repeal will result in more crime .
the repeal comes just days before mrs arroyo visits the vatican for an audience with pope benedict xvi .
some analysts see the repeal of the death penalty as an attempt to win support from bishops for the president 's plan to move to a parliamentary system of government .
others say mrs arroyo is trying to diffuse opposition from the church to the government 's efforts to revive mining .
the death penalty was abolished once before in 1987 but was re-imposed seven years later after a rise in crime .
under that law seven executions were carried out by lethal injection , but in 2000 , the then president , joseph estrada , ordered a moratorium after strong lobbying by the church , the european union and human rights groups .
