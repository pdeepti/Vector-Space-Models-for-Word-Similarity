" but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .
" we have to develop a new understanding of the concept of justice , one where solidarity and self-sufficiency are rebalanced .

the accomplice is allegedly jihad hamad , a 20-year-old lebanese , who is still at large .
officials searched a lebanese car dealer in essen , another business in oberhausen and a grocery store in gelsenkirchen .
they also questioned a man thought to be a contact person for the suspects and searched his kiel apartment .
at the same time , new details emerged about the movements of the two suspects immediately after they planted two bombs in suitcases on trains in cologne bound for dortmund and koblenz on july 31 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police caught youssef mohamad e. h. saturday in kiel that night , the two reportedly flew to istanbul , according to süddeutsche zeitung . hamad supposedly continued on to the middle east .
but youssef mohamad e. h. returned to germany .
why he did so remained unclear . new details emerge with the help of lebanese intelligence , which picked up a call youssef mohamad e. h. made to his family in lebanon after seeing his image broadcast on german television , police were able to catch him .
surveillance cameras from the cologne train station had captured the two men on film . german prosecutor general monika harms said tuesday police had discovered the identity of the second man , hamad , three weeks ago but failed to locate him .
the head of the federal crime office , jörg ziercke , had said late monday that he was confident the second bomb suspect would be captured , adding that police had garnered " a wealth of information " from youssef mohammed e.h. youssef mohamad e. h. has lived in germany since 2003 .
his alleged accomplice , investigators say , has been in germany twice and had lived in the country since february . berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that some of youssef mohammed e. h. 's relatives had links to the banned islamic extremist group hizb ut-tahrir and that the 21-year-old was believed to have been radicalized by the organization , which strives to create an islamic state .
investigators believe that the two may have made contact through that organization .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.08.2006 germans buying bigger cars but driving them less großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans ' cars saw less of the road and more of the garage in 2005 what 's not to love about german cars ?
the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .
atonement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gäfgen suffocated jakob von metzler in 2002 gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family , on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .

it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .

there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2006 opinion : iran nukes debate needs fair play all around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the ongoing nuclear standoff between the international community and tehran , both sides should be forced to play by the same rules , says dw 's peter philipp . in politics , like in games , those who do n't stick to the rules are either respected , or they are dismissed .
that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel . " new engines are not always the right answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger diesel engines are using more fuel about half of drivers in all three countries , however , hoped they would get better mileage from a new car , with germans the most likely to trade in their gas-guzzlers for cheaper diesel motors .
but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .
" this is because bigger and bigger cars with stronger and stronger diesel motors are being sold . " alexander morhart -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de calls go out for passenger car toll on the autobahn the interior minister of bavaria , günther beckstein , has called for a toll system to be instituted on passenger cars traveling germany 's freeway system to stop " gas station tourism .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel . " new engines are not always the right answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger diesel engines are using more fuel about half of drivers in all three countries , however , hoped they would get better mileage from a new car , with germans the most likely to trade in their gas-guzzlers for cheaper diesel motors .
but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .
" this is because bigger and bigger cars with stronger and stronger diesel motors are being sold .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .
" these changes have to be mirrored in our program .
this is a signal that the cdu is ready to deal with the questions of the 21st century - and find answers for them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cdu critics say merkel -lrb- with the vice chancellor franz müntefering , spd -rrb- is too friendly to her coalition partners in a nod to critics such as the moderate christian democratic premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , or more conservative business-minded members , merkel reminded party members that the cdu began as , and has long been , the " people 's party , " a party catering to the center . " we encompass all of germany , we are a party for everyone , " she said . falli n g poll rati n gs there has not been a lot of good news recently for the ruling members of the so-called grand coalition of christian and social democrats . a recent poll had the cdu / csu alliance holding onto first place over the social democrats by one percentage point : just 31 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the conservatives in the next federal election .
that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .
while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .
" we have to develop a new understanding of the concept of justice , one where solidarity and self-sufficiency are rebalanced .

the accomplice is allegedly jihad hamad , a 20-year-old lebanese , who is still at large .
officials searched a lebanese car dealer in essen , another business in oberhausen and a grocery store in gelsenkirchen .
they also questioned a man thought to be a contact person for the suspects and searched his kiel apartment .

why he did so remained unclear . new details emerge with the help of lebanese intelligence , which picked up a call youssef mohamad e. h. made to his family in lebanon after seeing his image broadcast on german television , police were able to catch him .
surveillance cameras from the cologne train station had captured the two men on film . german prosecutor general monika harms said tuesday police had discovered the identity of the second man , hamad , three weeks ago but failed to locate him .
the head of the federal crime office , jörg ziercke , had said late monday that he was confident the second bomb suspect would be captured , adding that police had garnered " a wealth of information " from youssef mohammed e.h. youssef mohamad e. h. has lived in germany since 2003 .
his alleged accomplice , investigators say , has been in germany twice and had lived in the country since february . berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that some of youssef mohammed e. h. 's relatives had links to the banned islamic extremist group hizb ut-tahrir and that the 21-year-old was believed to have been radicalized by the organization , which strives to create an islamic state .
investigators believe that the two may have made contact through that organization .
the anti-israeli organization has been banned in germany since 2003 .
hamburg islamic organization under scrutiny the online version of newsweekly der spiegel said that the office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic intelligence service , was following a lead to a mosque in the northern city of hamburg because youssef mohammed e.h. had a poster of the institution hanging in his dormitory in kiel .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .

but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .

interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .

leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .

questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .

that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .

adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel . " new engines are not always the right answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger diesel engines are using more fuel about half of drivers in all three countries , however , hoped they would get better mileage from a new car , with germans the most likely to trade in their gas-guzzlers for cheaper diesel motors .
but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .
" we need to step up monitoring of the internet , for which we need more experts with the right language skills .
we also need to intensify checks on the rail lines and air traffic security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also urged wider observation of suspicious groups by the domestic intelligence service and said muslims in germany could do more to stamp out extremism . " the great majority of muslims must say what they think more loudly - that they reject terror , " schäuble said .
" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks . " muslims wary of blanket condemnation the central council of muslims in germany offered on wednesday to step up its cooperation with the security services but warned against any blanket condemnation of islam in the fight against violent extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " killing innocent people does not mean jihad , " reads the sign at an anti-terror demonstration organized by turks in cologne in 2004 general secretary aiman mazyek told public broadcaster ard that the council aimed to offer more local contacts to police " because it is a muslim duty and our duty as citizens to report extremist tendencies . " he said the vast majority of muslims in germany rejected violence and were angered by being lumped together with " terrorists . " in a separate interview with berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel , mazyek said the council had recently received death threats . " a murder remains a murder , an attempted murder an attempted murder regardless of the perpetrator 's religion , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terror suspect fled germany for middle east , officials say german officials continue to search offices and apartments while questioning witnesses and " contacts " in an effort to catch the second man suspected of being part of a bomb plot in late july .

interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .

we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .
but increased reliance on big brother technology is not without its critics .
-lrb- aug .
22 , 2006 -rrb- homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .
the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded .

2 , 2006 -rrb- mulling more video surveillance in germany video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 german conservatives look to refocus and redefine program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to shed some light on the confusion within her party against a backdrop of party infighting and falling approval ratings , the governing christian democrats have begun debating the party 's platform and its future . some called it a pep rally .
others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .
" these changes have to be mirrored in our program .
this is a signal that the cdu is ready to deal with the questions of the 21st century - and find answers for them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cdu critics say merkel -lrb- with the vice chancellor franz müntefering , spd -rrb- is too friendly to her coalition partners in a nod to critics such as the moderate christian democratic premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , or more conservative business-minded members , merkel reminded party members that the cdu began as , and has long been , the " people 's party , " a party catering to the center . " we encompass all of germany , we are a party for everyone , " she said . falli n g poll rati n gs there has not been a lot of good news recently for the ruling members of the so-called grand coalition of christian and social democrats . a recent poll had the cdu / csu alliance holding onto first place over the social democrats by one percentage point : just 31 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the conservatives in the next federal election .
that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .
while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .
" we have to develop a new understanding of the concept of justice , one where solidarity and self-sufficiency are rebalanced . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back from vacation , merkel takes stock of government returned from four weeks of watching world events unfold without having to comment on them herself , german chancellor angela merkel gave her opinion on a number of issues from the middle east to video surveillance .

while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .

" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .
meanwhile , valuable time was squandered and the level of mistrust has increased . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran calls for talks over nuclear standoff iran called for talks tuesday as it delivered its response to a deal aimed at ending a long-running nuclear standoff , but did not say whether it had met the demands of the international community . -lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2006 opinion : iran nukes debate needs fair play all around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the ongoing nuclear standoff between the international community and tehran , both sides should be forced to play by the same rules , says dw 's peter philipp . in politics , like in games , those who do n't stick to the rules are either respected , or they are dismissed .
that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .

and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .

there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .
" we need to step up monitoring of the internet , for which we need more experts with the right language skills .
we also need to intensify checks on the rail lines and air traffic security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also urged wider observation of suspicious groups by the domestic intelligence service and said muslims in germany could do more to stamp out extremism . " the great majority of muslims must say what they think more loudly - that they reject terror , " schäuble said .
" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks . " muslims wary of blanket condemnation the central council of muslims in germany offered on wednesday to step up its cooperation with the security services but warned against any blanket condemnation of islam in the fight against violent extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " killing innocent people does not mean jihad , " reads the sign at an anti-terror demonstration organized by turks in cologne in 2004 general secretary aiman mazyek told public broadcaster ard that the council aimed to offer more local contacts to police " because it is a muslim duty and our duty as citizens to report extremist tendencies . " he said the vast majority of muslims in germany rejected violence and were angered by being lumped together with " terrorists . " in a separate interview with berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel , mazyek said the council had recently received death threats .

in world war i , german troops fight russian soldiers at the same site in the battle of tannenberg as a kind of symbolic undoing of grunwald . 1919 : upper silesia is divided through the treaty of versailles between germany and the newly independent republic of poland .
the city of danzig is made a free and independent political entity . sept .
1 , 1939 : nazi troops invade poland .
the country is subsequently divided between stalin and hitler and occupied by the red army and nazi troops , respectively during fall of 1939 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz , located outside krakow , was the nazis ' largest death camp 1939-1945 : deportation , forced labor , and ultimately mass murder is carried out by the nazis on jews , but also gypsies , homosexuals , slavs -lrb- particularly poles -rrb- and communists .
poland loses six million citizens and 20 percent of its territory as a result of the war . world war ii : some have commented that nazi propaganda was successful in infecting the poles with racism .
poland , however , already has its own history of anti-semitism .
just as in germany itself and the other occupied countries , many poles cooperate with the nazis , even to the point of assisting in the extermination ; many others actively or passively resist . 1945 : with the end of world war ii and the rise of communism , poles and east germans become politically connected in the same " red empire . "
communist propaganda was therefore quite positive toward the " brothers " in east germany -lrb- and vice versa -rrb- and , naturally , more negative toward west germany and other western countries . 1950 : the görlitzer treaty recognizes the oder-neisse border between germany and poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt apologized for nazi atrocities on the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 1970 : while in warsaw for a commemorative service honoring the participants of the warsaw ghetto uprising , german chancellor willy brandt kneels spontaneously in front of the monument - a controversial gesture of apology and reconciliation . 1970s : west germany gains respect in poland due to its phenomenal postwar economic recovery .
poles are experiencing economic frustrations , dissatisfaction with the regime and an increased awareness of the material inequality between the east and the west .
east and west germany exchange images in the eyes of the poles .
the historikerstreit , the first sincere effort to face the nazi past in germany , also helps to rehabilitate west germany in polish opinion . 1980s : the struggle , endurance and ultimate success of the solidarity movement in poland is observed with much interest and respect in west germany , east germany and the rest of the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity movement , born in the shipyards of gdansk , helped bring down communism in poland 1989-1990 : the berlin wall falls and west and east germany are reunited . 1990 : poland becomes an independent republic after 45 years of communist rule . 1994 : german president roman herzog attends the remembrance of the warsaw uprising , where he asked for forgiveness on behalf of his country . 1997 : germany and poland sign a bilateral cultural agreement . 2004 : conflict with the prussian trust organization over reparations from the world war ii .
the so-called preussische treuhand , supported by the polish parliament , calls for reparations from germany .
both the polish and the german governments are in opposition to reparations . april 30 , 2004 : german president rau is invited as guest of honor to a special session of both houses of polish parliament to discuss the eu accession on the following day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to poland 's eu membership on may 1 , 2004 may 1 , 2004 : poland joins the european union , along with nine other states , seven of which had been members of the soviet bloc . july 2004 : poland is the first country that german president horst köhler visits upon taking office . aug .

interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .

changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .
but increased reliance on big brother technology is not without its critics .
-lrb- aug .
22 , 2006 -rrb- homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .
the devices could have caused serious injury or death if they had exploded .
-lrb- aug .
2 , 2006 -rrb- mulling more video surveillance in germany video surveillance got a high-profile boost after british investigators nabbed suspects in the london bombings .
germany , too , will expand the measure in train stations .
but some are warning not to go too far .

others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .
" these changes have to be mirrored in our program .
this is a signal that the cdu is ready to deal with the questions of the 21st century - and find answers for them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cdu critics say merkel -lrb- with the vice chancellor franz müntefering , spd -rrb- is too friendly to her coalition partners in a nod to critics such as the moderate christian democratic premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , or more conservative business-minded members , merkel reminded party members that the cdu began as , and has long been , the " people 's party , " a party catering to the center . " we encompass all of germany , we are a party for everyone , " she said . falli n g poll rati n gs there has not been a lot of good news recently for the ruling members of the so-called grand coalition of christian and social democrats . a recent poll had the cdu / csu alliance holding onto first place over the social democrats by one percentage point : just 31 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the conservatives in the next federal election .
that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .
while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel .

but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .
" we need to step up monitoring of the internet , for which we need more experts with the right language skills .
we also need to intensify checks on the rail lines and air traffic security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also urged wider observation of suspicious groups by the domestic intelligence service and said muslims in germany could do more to stamp out extremism . " the great majority of muslims must say what they think more loudly - that they reject terror , " schäuble said .
" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks . " muslims wary of blanket condemnation the central council of muslims in germany offered on wednesday to step up its cooperation with the security services but warned against any blanket condemnation of islam in the fight against violent extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " killing innocent people does not mean jihad , " reads the sign at an anti-terror demonstration organized by turks in cologne in 2004 general secretary aiman mazyek told public broadcaster ard that the council aimed to offer more local contacts to police " because it is a muslim duty and our duty as citizens to report extremist tendencies . " he said the vast majority of muslims in germany rejected violence and were angered by being lumped together with " terrorists . " in a separate interview with berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel , mazyek said the council had recently received death threats .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .
" we need to step up monitoring of the internet , for which we need more experts with the right language skills .
we also need to intensify checks on the rail lines and air traffic security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior minister wolfgang schäuble schäuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , also urged wider observation of suspicious groups by the domestic intelligence service and said muslims in germany could do more to stamp out extremism . " the great majority of muslims must say what they think more loudly - that they reject terror , " schäuble said .
" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks . " muslims wary of blanket condemnation the central council of muslims in germany offered on wednesday to step up its cooperation with the security services but warned against any blanket condemnation of islam in the fight against violent extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " killing innocent people does not mean jihad , " reads the sign at an anti-terror demonstration organized by turks in cologne in 2004 general secretary aiman mazyek told public broadcaster ard that the council aimed to offer more local contacts to police " because it is a muslim duty and our duty as citizens to report extremist tendencies . " he said the vast majority of muslims in germany rejected violence and were angered by being lumped together with " terrorists . " in a separate interview with berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel , mazyek said the council had recently received death threats .

others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .
" these changes have to be mirrored in our program .
this is a signal that the cdu is ready to deal with the questions of the 21st century - and find answers for them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cdu critics say merkel -lrb- with the vice chancellor franz müntefering , spd -rrb- is too friendly to her coalition partners in a nod to critics such as the moderate christian democratic premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , or more conservative business-minded members , merkel reminded party members that the cdu began as , and has long been , the " people 's party , " a party catering to the center . " we encompass all of germany , we are a party for everyone , " she said . falli n g poll rati n gs there has not been a lot of good news recently for the ruling members of the so-called grand coalition of christian and social democrats . a recent poll had the cdu / csu alliance holding onto first place over the social democrats by one percentage point : just 31 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the conservatives in the next federal election .
that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .
while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .
the congress is a chance to take a step in a new direction , they say . " we must travel down a new path in the future , " said ronald pofalla , the cdu 's general secretary .
" we have to develop a new understanding of the concept of justice , one where solidarity and self-sufficiency are rebalanced .

"
grass is an honorary citizen of gdansk .
earlier revelations that grass had served in the waffen ss at age 17 were followed by calls by some politicians , including former polish president lech walesa , to strip him of his honorary citizenship in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass says he has now found the " right formula " in the letter to mayor pawel adamowicz , grass wrote that only in his old age has he found the " right formula " to talk about having served in the ss .
adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .
but in september 1944 , at the age of 17 , i was conscripted into the waffen ss , without having a say . " the german novelist , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , added : " it 's only now , with age , that i have found a suitable way of talking about it from a wider perspective . " " i would however like to maintain the right to affirm that i have learned the painful lesson that life gave me in my youth .
my books and my political activity are testimony to that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa : " i think he 's explained himself sufficiently " grass , 78 , revealed his ss past earlier this month , stunning germans and drawing criticism in poland , which was invaded by nazi germany in world war ii . poland 's ruling law and justice party has called on the gdansk city authorities to revoke grass ' honor .
but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .
in suburban areas we have to do what needs to be done , and to a large extent that is already in place .
this is a matter of states ' responsibility .
changing existing laws is superfluous . dw-world.de : have the suitcase bombers fundamentally changed the security situation in germany ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think not .
everyone knows that after september 11 , every country in europe faces an increased abstract terrorist threat , and in germany this was spelled out by the discovery of these homemade bombs .
in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .
is this a natural reflex ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : within the area of homeland security , these are standard reflexes and rituals .
interior ministers , state secretaries and security authorities will always use the opportunity to tell the public what needs to change , and in fact , what they should focus on is everything that has already been done in germany , what 's already in place .
certain things simply wo n't every work , and for me , future deployment of the bundeswehr as a security force in stations comes under this category . dw-world.de : is there any alternative to tightening security legislation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european cities face a heightened terrorism threat post-9/11 leutheusser-schnarrenberger : i think we need to make the most of our existing operative capacities , but i also think it 's extremely important we take stock of what changing security legislation in the five years since the horrifying events of september 11 has actually brought about .
we need a detailed analysis of which measures work , which do n't work and what effect recording highly personal data has on respectable citizens .
questions like these need to be part of the security debate . dw-world.de : those who say we need to tighten security believe you have to compromise freedom in order to protect it . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : this theory is incorrect .
you can curtail freedom completely and still have no guarantee of safety - as you can see from totalitarian dictatorships , which still have problems with criminality , attacks and so on .
you have to strike the right balance between freedom and security , and this is what we 've managed to do in germany .
we have a high level of security .
authorities are engaged in a number of activities the public is completely unaware of .
bank accounts are monitored , the intelligence services can find out about travel bookings .
we have a very dense network .
that 's what we need to tell the public , rather than worrying them further . dw-world.de : ever since your campaign against what became known as the german eavesdropping law , you have had a reputation as a vehement defender of the right to privacy .
how has this been affected by the attacks of september 11 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2003 , the constitutional court ruled that the eavesdropping law was unconstitutional leutheusser-schnarrenberger : unfortunately , ever fewer people are willing to defend the right to privacy , even though it 's a basic constitutional right .
those who do , increasingly find their backs are against the wall .
when you 're swimming against the stream , it 's more important than ever to speak up on behalf of personal freedom . dw-world.de : do you think state control might be relaxed if the situation changes again ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : after decades of political experience , i 'm inclined to say that the state wo n't ever reverse progress it has made in curtailing personal freedoms .
legislation passed in response to the terrorism practiced by the red army faction -lrb- eds . : a german left-wing terrorist group active in the 1970s and ' 80s -rrb- , which can not be compared to the present threat , has never been reviewed even though it 's now redundant .
the state is never going to relinquish power it 's won . dw-world.de : which is something you will continue to tackle . leutheusser-schnarrenberger : of course .
the country needs someone to give the constitutional court a chance to make clear that personal freedom can not be infringed in all cases . oliver samson -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb threat reignites german debate on video surveillance hardly anyone disputes the importance of video surveillance cameras in arresting one of the two railway bombers in the german town of kiel .
but increased reliance on big brother technology is not without its critics .
-lrb- aug .
22 , 2006 -rrb- homemade bombs found on german railway german federal prosecutors are investigating a possible terrorist link to two unexploded bombs discovered in dortmund and koblenz .

"
grass is an honorary citizen of gdansk .
earlier revelations that grass had served in the waffen ss at age 17 were followed by calls by some politicians , including former polish president lech walesa , to strip him of his honorary citizenship in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass says he has now found the " right formula " in the letter to mayor pawel adamowicz , grass wrote that only in his old age has he found the " right formula " to talk about having served in the ss .
adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .
but in september 1944 , at the age of 17 , i was conscripted into the waffen ss , without having a say . " the german novelist , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , added : " it 's only now , with age , that i have found a suitable way of talking about it from a wider perspective . " " i would however like to maintain the right to affirm that i have learned the painful lesson that life gave me in my youth .
my books and my political activity are testimony to that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa : " i think he 's explained himself sufficiently " grass , 78 , revealed his ss past earlier this month , stunning germans and drawing criticism in poland , which was invaded by nazi germany in world war ii . poland 's ruling law and justice party has called on the gdansk city authorities to revoke grass ' honor .
but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .
grass defends long silence as book sales soar the confession by german writer günter grass on his wartime activity has piqued interest in his autobiography , on sale earlier than planned .
-lrb- aug .
17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .
but he at least admitted his own hypocrisy , said dw-world.de 's toma tasovac .

"
grass is an honorary citizen of gdansk .
earlier revelations that grass had served in the waffen ss at age 17 were followed by calls by some politicians , including former polish president lech walesa , to strip him of his honorary citizenship in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass says he has now found the " right formula " in the letter to mayor pawel adamowicz , grass wrote that only in his old age has he found the " right formula " to talk about having served in the ss .
adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .
but in september 1944 , at the age of 17 , i was conscripted into the waffen ss , without having a say . " the german novelist , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , added : " it 's only now , with age , that i have found a suitable way of talking about it from a wider perspective . " " i would however like to maintain the right to affirm that i have learned the painful lesson that life gave me in my youth .
my books and my political activity are testimony to that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa : " i think he 's explained himself sufficiently " grass , 78 , revealed his ss past earlier this month , stunning germans and drawing criticism in poland , which was invaded by nazi germany in world war ii . poland 's ruling law and justice party has called on the gdansk city authorities to revoke grass ' honor .
but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2006 opinion : iran nukes debate needs fair play all around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the ongoing nuclear standoff between the international community and tehran , both sides should be forced to play by the same rules , says dw 's peter philipp . in politics , like in games , those who do n't stick to the rules are either respected , or they are dismissed .
that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .
meanwhile , valuable time was squandered and the level of mistrust has increased . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran calls for talks over nuclear standoff iran called for talks tuesday as it delivered its response to a deal aimed at ending a long-running nuclear standoff , but did not say whether it had met the demands of the international community . -lrb- aug .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .
meanwhile , valuable time was squandered and the level of mistrust has increased . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran calls for talks over nuclear standoff iran called for talks tuesday as it delivered its response to a deal aimed at ending a long-running nuclear standoff , but did not say whether it had met the demands of the international community . -lrb- aug .

" french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put it stronger by tying the resumption of talks to a suspension of iranian nuclear activities . " what i know is that the resolution 1696 ... tells iran it must stop all uranium enrichment by aug .
31 , " he told reporters .
" as we have always said ... a return to the negotiating table is tied to the suspension of uranium enrichment .

" a right to technology washington suspects the nuclear program is a cover for an attempt to produce a bomb .
enrichment can make fuel for nuclear power stations or be extended to create the core of atomic weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranians say that their nuclear activities are peaceful however , iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , insists it is purely for peaceful power generation and that it has the right to the technology as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . tehran gave the written response to representatives of the five permanent security council members plus germany , which drew up the package of trade , technology and security incentives . economic sanctions looming the united states began urging punitive action while russia said it was important to explore " nuances " in iran 's response and tehran 's major trade partner china said sanctions were not the way to resolve the crisis . " we will obviously study the iranian response carefully , " said john bolton , the us ambassador to the united nations .
" but we are also prepared - if it does not meet the terms set - to proceed here in the security council ... with economic sanctions . " russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power plant , said it would continue to press for a political solution and wanted to keep the un nuclear watchdog - not the security council - at the center of the process . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin told interfax news agency that " russia will continue with the idea of seeking a political , negotiated settlement concerning iran 's nuclear program . " meanwhile , a chinese foreign ministry statement said that " we also hope that other parties concerned will remain calm and patient , show flexibility , stick to the orientation of peaceful resolution and create favorable conditions for resuming talks as soon as possible .

the accomplice is allegedly jihad hamad , a 20-year-old lebanese , who is still at large .
officials searched a lebanese car dealer in essen , another business in oberhausen and a grocery store in gelsenkirchen .
they also questioned a man thought to be a contact person for the suspects and searched his kiel apartment .

why he did so remained unclear . new details emerge with the help of lebanese intelligence , which picked up a call youssef mohamad e. h. made to his family in lebanon after seeing his image broadcast on german television , police were able to catch him .
surveillance cameras from the cologne train station had captured the two men on film . german prosecutor general monika harms said tuesday police had discovered the identity of the second man , hamad , three weeks ago but failed to locate him .
the head of the federal crime office , jörg ziercke , had said late monday that he was confident the second bomb suspect would be captured , adding that police had garnered " a wealth of information " from youssef mohammed e.h. youssef mohamad e. h. has lived in germany since 2003 .
his alleged accomplice , investigators say , has been in germany twice and had lived in the country since february . berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that some of youssef mohammed e. h. 's relatives had links to the banned islamic extremist group hizb ut-tahrir and that the 21-year-old was believed to have been radicalized by the organization , which strives to create an islamic state .
investigators believe that the two may have made contact through that organization .
the anti-israeli organization has been banned in germany since 2003 .
hamburg islamic organization under scrutiny the online version of newsweekly der spiegel said that the office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic intelligence service , was following a lead to a mosque in the northern city of hamburg because youssef mohammed e.h. had a poster of the institution hanging in his dormitory in kiel .

a spokesman for the mosque denied any contact with youssef mohammed e.h.

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

the head of the federal crime office , jörg ziercke , had said late monday that he was confident the second bomb suspect would be captured , adding that police had garnered " a wealth of information " from youssef mohammed e.h. youssef mohamad e. h. has lived in germany since 2003 .
his alleged accomplice , investigators say , has been in germany twice and had lived in the country since february . berlin daily der tagesspiegel reported that some of youssef mohammed e. h. 's relatives had links to the banned islamic extremist group hizb ut-tahrir and that the 21-year-old was believed to have been radicalized by the organization , which strives to create an islamic state .
investigators believe that the two may have made contact through that organization .
the anti-israeli organization has been banned in germany since 2003 .
hamburg islamic organization under scrutiny the online version of newsweekly der spiegel said that the office for the protection of the constitution , the domestic intelligence service , was following a lead to a mosque in the northern city of hamburg because youssef mohammed e.h. had a poster of the institution hanging in his dormitory in kiel .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel . " new engines are not always the right answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger diesel engines are using more fuel about half of drivers in all three countries , however , hoped they would get better mileage from a new car , with germans the most likely to trade in their gas-guzzlers for cheaper diesel motors .
but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .
" this is because bigger and bigger cars with stronger and stronger diesel motors are being sold .

" french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy put it stronger by tying the resumption of talks to a suspension of iranian nuclear activities . " what i know is that the resolution 1696 ... tells iran it must stop all uranium enrichment by aug .
31 , " he told reporters .
" as we have always said ... a return to the negotiating table is tied to the suspension of uranium enrichment .

" iranians signal they want serious talks , but they do not appear to be willing to make significant concessions . " an iranian official confirmed tehran 's refusal to suspend enrichment , despite the risk of un sanctions , but insisted : " we can discuss all the items of the proposal ; this is a sign of flexibility on iran 's part . " a right to technology washington suspects the nuclear program is a cover for an attempt to produce a bomb .
enrichment can make fuel for nuclear power stations or be extended to create the core of atomic weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranians say that their nuclear activities are peaceful however , iran , the world 's fourth largest oil producer , insists it is purely for peaceful power generation and that it has the right to the technology as a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . tehran gave the written response to representatives of the five permanent security council members plus germany , which drew up the package of trade , technology and security incentives . economic sanctions looming the united states began urging punitive action while russia said it was important to explore " nuances " in iran 's response and tehran 's major trade partner china said sanctions were not the way to resolve the crisis . " we will obviously study the iranian response carefully , " said john bolton , the us ambassador to the united nations .
" but we are also prepared - if it does not meet the terms set - to proceed here in the security council ... with economic sanctions . " russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power plant , said it would continue to press for a political solution and wanted to keep the un nuclear watchdog - not the security council - at the center of the process . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin told interfax news agency that " russia will continue with the idea of seeking a political , negotiated settlement concerning iran 's nuclear program . " meanwhile , a chinese foreign ministry statement said that " we also hope that other parties concerned will remain calm and patient , show flexibility , stick to the orientation of peaceful resolution and create favorable conditions for resuming talks as soon as possible .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research . " in regards to changes in the cost of mobility , you can generally say that they have become relatively cheaper over the past decades , even when there is an impression that everything has got more expensive , " he said .
" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .
" people in england took more drastic measures of looking for a job closer to home to save fuel . " new engines are not always the right answer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bigger diesel engines are using more fuel about half of drivers in all three countries , however , hoped they would get better mileage from a new car , with germans the most likely to trade in their gas-guzzlers for cheaper diesel motors .
but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .
" this is because bigger and bigger cars with stronger and stronger diesel motors are being sold .

in world war i , german troops fight russian soldiers at the same site in the battle of tannenberg as a kind of symbolic undoing of grunwald . 1919 : upper silesia is divided through the treaty of versailles between germany and the newly independent republic of poland .
the city of danzig is made a free and independent political entity . sept .
1 , 1939 : nazi troops invade poland .
the country is subsequently divided between stalin and hitler and occupied by the red army and nazi troops , respectively during fall of 1939 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz , located outside krakow , was the nazis ' largest death camp 1939-1945 : deportation , forced labor , and ultimately mass murder is carried out by the nazis on jews , but also gypsies , homosexuals , slavs -lrb- particularly poles -rrb- and communists .
poland loses six million citizens and 20 percent of its territory as a result of the war . world war ii : some have commented that nazi propaganda was successful in infecting the poles with racism .
poland , however , already has its own history of anti-semitism .
just as in germany itself and the other occupied countries , many poles cooperate with the nazis , even to the point of assisting in the extermination ; many others actively or passively resist . 1945 : with the end of world war ii and the rise of communism , poles and east germans become politically connected in the same " red empire . "
communist propaganda was therefore quite positive toward the " brothers " in east germany -lrb- and vice versa -rrb- and , naturally , more negative toward west germany and other western countries . 1950 : the görlitzer treaty recognizes the oder-neisse border between germany and poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt apologized for nazi atrocities on the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 1970 : while in warsaw for a commemorative service honoring the participants of the warsaw ghetto uprising , german chancellor willy brandt kneels spontaneously in front of the monument - a controversial gesture of apology and reconciliation . 1970s : west germany gains respect in poland due to its phenomenal postwar economic recovery .
poles are experiencing economic frustrations , dissatisfaction with the regime and an increased awareness of the material inequality between the east and the west .
east and west germany exchange images in the eyes of the poles .
the historikerstreit , the first sincere effort to face the nazi past in germany , also helps to rehabilitate west germany in polish opinion . 1980s : the struggle , endurance and ultimate success of the solidarity movement in poland is observed with much interest and respect in west germany , east germany and the rest of the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity movement , born in the shipyards of gdansk , helped bring down communism in poland 1989-1990 : the berlin wall falls and west and east germany are reunited . 1990 : poland becomes an independent republic after 45 years of communist rule . 1994 : german president roman herzog attends the remembrance of the warsaw uprising , where he asked for forgiveness on behalf of his country . 1997 : germany and poland sign a bilateral cultural agreement . 2004 : conflict with the prussian trust organization over reparations from the world war ii .
the so-called preussische treuhand , supported by the polish parliament , calls for reparations from germany .
both the polish and the german governments are in opposition to reparations . april 30 , 2004 : german president rau is invited as guest of honor to a special session of both houses of polish parliament to discuss the eu accession on the following day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to poland 's eu membership on may 1 , 2004 may 1 , 2004 : poland joins the european union , along with nine other states , seven of which had been members of the soviet bloc . july 2004 : poland is the first country that german president horst köhler visits upon taking office . aug .

"
grass is an honorary citizen of gdansk .
earlier revelations that grass had served in the waffen ss at age 17 were followed by calls by some politicians , including former polish president lech walesa , to strip him of his honorary citizenship in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass says he has now found the " right formula " in the letter to mayor pawel adamowicz , grass wrote that only in his old age has he found the " right formula " to talk about having served in the ss .
adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .
but in september 1944 , at the age of 17 , i was conscripted into the waffen ss , without having a say . " the german novelist , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , added : " it 's only now , with age , that i have found a suitable way of talking about it from a wider perspective . " " i would however like to maintain the right to affirm that i have learned the painful lesson that life gave me in my youth .
my books and my political activity are testimony to that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa : " i think he 's explained himself sufficiently " grass , 78 , revealed his ss past earlier this month , stunning germans and drawing criticism in poland , which was invaded by nazi germany in world war ii . poland 's ruling law and justice party has called on the gdansk city authorities to revoke grass ' honor .
but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .

others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .

" it would be irresponsible to conclude from the success of the police search that we do not need to do more , " he said , referring to the capture on saturday of one of two lebanese men suspected of planting bombs on trains last month .
a second suspect , also captured on security cameras while planting the bombs , has been identified but remains at large .
technical defects prevented an almost certain bloodbath . the notion of beefing up security powers is contentious in germany due to the abuses by the nazi and communist dictatorships , but schäuble said that more monitoring was needed . " more security cameras should be used where it is sensible , " he said .
" we need to step up monitoring of the internet , for which we need more experts with the right language skills .
we also need to intensify checks on the rail lines and air traffic security .

" the great majority of muslims must say what they think more loudly - that they reject terror , " schäuble said .
" after all , it threatens muslims just as much as non-muslims .
we need the cooperation of organizations to fight extremists in their ranks . " muslims wary of blanket condemnation the central council of muslims in germany offered on wednesday to step up its cooperation with the security services but warned against any blanket condemnation of islam in the fight against violent extremists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " killing innocent people does not mean jihad , " reads the sign at an anti-terror demonstration organized by turks in cologne in 2004 general secretary aiman mazyek told public broadcaster ard that the council aimed to offer more local contacts to police " because it is a muslim duty and our duty as citizens to report extremist tendencies . " he said the vast majority of muslims in germany rejected violence and were angered by being lumped together with " terrorists . " in a separate interview with berlin 's daily der tagesspiegel , mazyek said the council had recently received death threats .

others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2006 opinion : iran nukes debate needs fair play all around großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the ongoing nuclear standoff between the international community and tehran , both sides should be forced to play by the same rules , says dw 's peter philipp . in politics , like in games , those who do n't stick to the rules are either respected , or they are dismissed .
that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .
meanwhile , valuable time was squandered and the level of mistrust has increased . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran calls for talks over nuclear standoff iran called for talks tuesday as it delivered its response to a deal aimed at ending a long-running nuclear standoff , but did not say whether it had met the demands of the international community . -lrb- aug .
22 , 2006 -rrb- defiant iran vows to press on with nuclear program iran on tuesday is expected to respond to an offer by the eu , us and others to solve the nuclear crisis .
but iran 's supreme leader already said his country will press on with its controversial nuclear work .

22 , 2006 -rrb- iran nuclear crisis timeline the un has confirmed that iran has failed to meet a deadline to halt work on nuclear fuel enrichment .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .
atonement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gäfgen suffocated jakob von metzler in 2002 gäfgen kidnapped jakob von metzler , the 11-year-old son of a prominent frankfurt banking family , on sept .
27 , 2002 , as the boy was on his way home from school .
the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.08.2006 timeline : war and peace in german-polish relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people say , time heals all wounds and children are the future dw-world.de has compiled a timeline of important events in the german-polish relationship to better understand the context of the recent developments . 1410 : at the battle of grunwald , germanic knights are defeated by subjects of the united polish-lithuanian-byelorussian kingdom near the present-day city of olsztyn .
in world war i , german troops fight russian soldiers at the same site in the battle of tannenberg as a kind of symbolic undoing of grunwald . 1919 : upper silesia is divided through the treaty of versailles between germany and the newly independent republic of poland .
the city of danzig is made a free and independent political entity . sept .
1 , 1939 : nazi troops invade poland .
the country is subsequently divided between stalin and hitler and occupied by the red army and nazi troops , respectively during fall of 1939 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz , located outside krakow , was the nazis ' largest death camp 1939-1945 : deportation , forced labor , and ultimately mass murder is carried out by the nazis on jews , but also gypsies , homosexuals , slavs -lrb- particularly poles -rrb- and communists .
poland loses six million citizens and 20 percent of its territory as a result of the war . world war ii : some have commented that nazi propaganda was successful in infecting the poles with racism .
poland , however , already has its own history of anti-semitism .
just as in germany itself and the other occupied countries , many poles cooperate with the nazis , even to the point of assisting in the extermination ; many others actively or passively resist . 1945 : with the end of world war ii and the rise of communism , poles and east germans become politically connected in the same " red empire . "
communist propaganda was therefore quite positive toward the " brothers " in east germany -lrb- and vice versa -rrb- and , naturally , more negative toward west germany and other western countries . 1950 : the görlitzer treaty recognizes the oder-neisse border between germany and poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt apologized for nazi atrocities on the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 1970 : while in warsaw for a commemorative service honoring the participants of the warsaw ghetto uprising , german chancellor willy brandt kneels spontaneously in front of the monument - a controversial gesture of apology and reconciliation . 1970s : west germany gains respect in poland due to its phenomenal postwar economic recovery .
poles are experiencing economic frustrations , dissatisfaction with the regime and an increased awareness of the material inequality between the east and the west .
east and west germany exchange images in the eyes of the poles .

communist propaganda was therefore quite positive toward the " brothers " in east germany -lrb- and vice versa -rrb- and , naturally , more negative toward west germany and other western countries . 1950 : the görlitzer treaty recognizes the oder-neisse border between germany and poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt apologized for nazi atrocities on the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 1970 : while in warsaw for a commemorative service honoring the participants of the warsaw ghetto uprising , german chancellor willy brandt kneels spontaneously in front of the monument - a controversial gesture of apology and reconciliation . 1970s : west germany gains respect in poland due to its phenomenal postwar economic recovery .
poles are experiencing economic frustrations , dissatisfaction with the regime and an increased awareness of the material inequality between the east and the west .
east and west germany exchange images in the eyes of the poles .
the historikerstreit , the first sincere effort to face the nazi past in germany , also helps to rehabilitate west germany in polish opinion . 1980s : the struggle , endurance and ultimate success of the solidarity movement in poland is observed with much interest and respect in west germany , east germany and the rest of the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity movement , born in the shipyards of gdansk , helped bring down communism in poland 1989-1990 : the berlin wall falls and west and east germany are reunited . 1990 : poland becomes an independent republic after 45 years of communist rule . 1994 : german president roman herzog attends the remembrance of the warsaw uprising , where he asked for forgiveness on behalf of his country . 1997 : germany and poland sign a bilateral cultural agreement . 2004 : conflict with the prussian trust organization over reparations from the world war ii .
the so-called preussische treuhand , supported by the polish parliament , calls for reparations from germany .
both the polish and the german governments are in opposition to reparations . april 30 , 2004 : german president rau is invited as guest of honor to a special session of both houses of polish parliament to discuss the eu accession on the following day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to poland 's eu membership on may 1 , 2004 may 1 , 2004 : poland joins the european union , along with nine other states , seven of which had been members of the soviet bloc . july 2004 : poland is the first country that german president horst köhler visits upon taking office . aug .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .
meanwhile , valuable time was squandered and the level of mistrust has increased . middle east expert peter philipp is deutsche welle 's chief correspondent -lrb- jen -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran calls for talks over nuclear standoff iran called for talks tuesday as it delivered its response to a deal aimed at ending a long-running nuclear standoff , but did not say whether it had met the demands of the international community . -lrb- aug .

"
grass is an honorary citizen of gdansk .
earlier revelations that grass had served in the waffen ss at age 17 were followed by calls by some politicians , including former polish president lech walesa , to strip him of his honorary citizenship in the city . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grass says he has now found the " right formula " in the letter to mayor pawel adamowicz , grass wrote that only in his old age has he found the " right formula " to talk about having served in the ss .
adamowicz had written to grass asking him asking for an explanation . the letter was read out tuesday during a news conference in gdansk , where grass was born in 1927 when it was known as danzig , and mainly inhabited by germans . walesa , who is also an honorary citizen of gdansk , responded by saying he was dropping his demand that grass give up his honorary citizenship .
the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .
but in september 1944 , at the age of 17 , i was conscripted into the waffen ss , without having a say . " the german novelist , who won the nobel prize for literature in 1999 , added : " it 's only now , with age , that i have found a suitable way of talking about it from a wider perspective . " " i would however like to maintain the right to affirm that i have learned the painful lesson that life gave me in my youth .
my books and my political activity are testimony to that . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walesa : " i think he 's explained himself sufficiently " grass , 78 , revealed his ss past earlier this month , stunning germans and drawing criticism in poland , which was invaded by nazi germany in world war ii . poland 's ruling law and justice party has called on the gdansk city authorities to revoke grass ' honor .
but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .

17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : a late confession is better than no confession at all it is inexcusable that günter grass kept silent about his involvement with the waffen ss combat troops during world war ii .

in world war i , german troops fight russian soldiers at the same site in the battle of tannenberg as a kind of symbolic undoing of grunwald . 1919 : upper silesia is divided through the treaty of versailles between germany and the newly independent republic of poland .
the city of danzig is made a free and independent political entity . sept .
1 , 1939 : nazi troops invade poland .
the country is subsequently divided between stalin and hitler and occupied by the red army and nazi troops , respectively during fall of 1939 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz , located outside krakow , was the nazis ' largest death camp 1939-1945 : deportation , forced labor , and ultimately mass murder is carried out by the nazis on jews , but also gypsies , homosexuals , slavs -lrb- particularly poles -rrb- and communists .
poland loses six million citizens and 20 percent of its territory as a result of the war . world war ii : some have commented that nazi propaganda was successful in infecting the poles with racism .
poland , however , already has its own history of anti-semitism .
just as in germany itself and the other occupied countries , many poles cooperate with the nazis , even to the point of assisting in the extermination ; many others actively or passively resist . 1945 : with the end of world war ii and the rise of communism , poles and east germans become politically connected in the same " red empire . "
communist propaganda was therefore quite positive toward the " brothers " in east germany -lrb- and vice versa -rrb- and , naturally , more negative toward west germany and other western countries . 1950 : the görlitzer treaty recognizes the oder-neisse border between germany and poland . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : willy brandt apologized for nazi atrocities on the anniversary of the warsaw ghetto uprising 1970 : while in warsaw for a commemorative service honoring the participants of the warsaw ghetto uprising , german chancellor willy brandt kneels spontaneously in front of the monument - a controversial gesture of apology and reconciliation . 1970s : west germany gains respect in poland due to its phenomenal postwar economic recovery .
poles are experiencing economic frustrations , dissatisfaction with the regime and an increased awareness of the material inequality between the east and the west .
east and west germany exchange images in the eyes of the poles .
the historikerstreit , the first sincere effort to face the nazi past in germany , also helps to rehabilitate west germany in polish opinion . 1980s : the struggle , endurance and ultimate success of the solidarity movement in poland is observed with much interest and respect in west germany , east germany and the rest of the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the solidarity movement , born in the shipyards of gdansk , helped bring down communism in poland 1989-1990 : the berlin wall falls and west and east germany are reunited . 1990 : poland becomes an independent republic after 45 years of communist rule . 1994 : german president roman herzog attends the remembrance of the warsaw uprising , where he asked for forgiveness on behalf of his country . 1997 : germany and poland sign a bilateral cultural agreement . 2004 : conflict with the prussian trust organization over reparations from the world war ii .
the so-called preussische treuhand , supported by the polish parliament , calls for reparations from germany .
both the polish and the german governments are in opposition to reparations . april 30 , 2004 : german president rau is invited as guest of honor to a special session of both houses of polish parliament to discuss the eu accession on the following day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheers to poland 's eu membership on may 1 , 2004 may 1 , 2004 : poland joins the european union , along with nine other states , seven of which had been members of the soviet bloc . july 2004 : poland is the first country that german president horst köhler visits upon taking office . aug .

instead , officials in the western city of trier called the initiative inappropriate and said that such an institution - named after the 31-year-old german man convicted of killing a child in 2002 , magnus gäfgen - would be always associated with the man and his act .
the plans came under trier jurisdiction because gäfgen 's lawyer , michael heuchemer , has his office in the state of rhineland-palatinate .
heuchemer declined comment on the ruling .

the same day he suffocated metzler , he demanded one million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- from the metzler family for the boy 's release , which they paid .
when the boy was not released , the police , who had been observing gäfgen for days , arrested him at the frankfurt airport .
in july 2003 , he was found guilty of abduction , murder and blackmail and sentenced to life in prison .
according gäfgen 's lawyer , the 31-year-old convicted murderer wanted to establish the charity as a symbol of atonement .
" the thought of a charitable engagement can only serve as an attempt to set a counter-symbol for the injustice committed in 2002 , " heuchemer said in a statement .
the foundation was to be called " horizons - children and youth foundation . "
its original capital amounts to 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 32,215 -rrb- .
in the paperwork submitted to the authorities , heuchemer is listed as the foundation president , but gäfgen himself would have chosen the children that were to receive help from the foundation . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de convicted child murderer plans foundation to help children magnus gäfgen is a busy man .

" as we have always said ... a return to the negotiating table is tied to the suspension of uranium enrichment .

" we will obviously study the iranian response carefully , " said john bolton , the us ambassador to the united nations .
" but we are also prepared - if it does not meet the terms set - to proceed here in the security council ... with economic sanctions . " russia , which is building iran 's first nuclear power plant , said it would continue to press for a political solution and wanted to keep the un nuclear watchdog - not the security council - at the center of the process . russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin told interfax news agency that " russia will continue with the idea of seeking a political , negotiated settlement concerning iran 's nuclear program .

as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway .

people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

" but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .

but the car many drivers bring home from the dealer does n't always prove to be the best bet . " over the last few years the average consumption of a gas-fuelled car has hardly sunk , while the average consumption for a diesel car has gone back up , " kuhfeld said .

the fuel consumption , according to some drivers .
as gas prices rise by up to 15 percent , some german drivers are cutting back on their driving - for the first time ever . year after year , it seemed germans , and most other europeans , were happy to drive their cars more and farther than before .
then came 2005 and the first-ever drop in how often germans pulled their cars out of the driveway . " over the last year we observed that there were cuts in actual distance traveled , that the average distance traveled per car went down 3 percent , " said hartmut kuhfeld of the german institute for economic research in berlin .
" before it was always the case that it stagnated or only negligibly declined .
people choose to save in other ways in order to be able to afford gas . " but over the past few decades , gas has steadily become more affordable .
the same amount of fuel has become cheaper when measured against a person 's buying power .
the average employee had to work for 14 minutes to be able to afford one liter -lrb- about one-fourth of a gallon -rrb- of gas in 1960 , while in 1991 it took just four minutes work to buy the same amount . sticker shock overshadows reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prices are n't as shocking as some drivers feel , knie said it 's the psychological effects of seeing bigger and bigger numbers adorning signs on the autobahn and the increasing distances people tend to drive that has created the feeling fuel is more difficult to afford , according to andreas knie of berlin 's economic center for social research .

" measured against the figures from 1950 and 1960 , over the years , the price for driving a car have been stable or even sunk a little . " but violence in the middle east , a corroded pipeline in alaska , high demand coming from china and india , and speculators hoping to take a profit have driven up the price for a barrel of oil to over $ 70 -lrb- 54 euros -rrb- .
the average price in germany for a liter of gas rose from 95 euro cents in january 2005 to 1.22 euros in december , which has left some drivers of mid and high-range cars to think twice before they put the key in the ignition . drivers switching to smaller cars and fewer trips bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drivers experience the joy of returning from german vacation " even in higher income brackets there is a switch being made to smaller cars for trips made alone or with the family , " said stephan thun , european head of the maritz market research company , which polled 1,200 car owners from france , great britain and germany . reactions to gas prices in the trio of countries differed widely , according to the maritz report .
germans were double as likely to cut back on long drives and vacation trips as french drivers . " the french drivers were especially likely to say they would eliminate trips that were not essential , " thun said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 striking the right balance between freedom and security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leutheusser-schnarrenberger - swimming against the stream sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger , deputy parliamentary leader of the fdp and high-profile civil rights campaigner , talked to dw-world.de about germany 's current security debate . dw-world.de : the recent arrest of one of the two suspected suitcase bombers has reignited a debate about beefing up national security .
interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .
for now , liaising does n't work , as illustrated by the attempted ban of the far-right national democratic party .
but it 's wrong to give people the idea that germany has security deficits . dw-world.de : the suspects would never have been caught without video surveillance cameras … . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a breach of personal freedom ?
leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .

interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants to give police greater jurisdiction , and even basic principles , such as the principal witness law , are up for discussion .
what 's your own position on these developments ? leutheusser-schnarrenberger : so many sweeping security packages were approved in the aftermath of september 11 that it 's simply wrong to suggest there are any security shortfalls in germany .
but if there is room for improvement then it 's in the cooperation between the various federal offices for the protection of the constitution from hamburg to munich , bremen to berlin .

leutheusser-schnarrenberger : but that goes to show that security is adequate .
we have cameras in all our central stations , which has had a positive effect .
but setting up cameras in all 5,700 regional stations is out of the question .

in london , madrid and istanbul we 've already seen what terrorists are capable of . dw-world.de : every attack or attempted attack is inevitably followed by renewed calls to tighten security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.08.2006 german conservatives look to refocus and redefine program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is trying to shed some light on the confusion within her party against a backdrop of party infighting and falling approval ratings , the governing christian democrats have begun debating the party 's platform and its future . some called it a pep rally .
others said it was an opportunity to rein in discontented party members .
but foremost , said christian democratic leaders , the first congress on party principals in 12 years , which took place in berlin on tuesday , was a chance to begin to reevaluate the party 's platform and look to the future . just in time , too , according to many in politics and industry .
falling approval ratings and increasingly vociferous criticism - even from prominent party hacks - are leading voters to question the seemingly narrowing ideological gap between the conservatives and social democrats and raise the question of whether the party is imploding . the one-day meeting 's motto was " more justice through more freedom . "
it aimed to kick-start a year-long debate culminating in positions on such issues as the party 's identity , security issues , demographic change , families and germany 's role in the eu and the world . " since the last time our platform was decided on , in 1994 , much in the world , in our country and even in our party , has changed , " said chancellor angela merkel at the meeting .
" these changes have to be mirrored in our program .
this is a signal that the cdu is ready to deal with the questions of the 21st century - and find answers for them . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some cdu critics say merkel -lrb- with the vice chancellor franz müntefering , spd -rrb- is too friendly to her coalition partners in a nod to critics such as the moderate christian democratic premier of north-rhine westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , or more conservative business-minded members , merkel reminded party members that the cdu began as , and has long been , the " people 's party , " a party catering to the center . " we encompass all of germany , we are a party for everyone , " she said . falli n g poll rati n gs there has not been a lot of good news recently for the ruling members of the so-called grand coalition of christian and social democrats . a recent poll had the cdu / csu alliance holding onto first place over the social democrats by one percentage point : just 31 percent of those surveyed said they would vote for the conservatives in the next federal election .
that is four points lower than in the september 2005 election . since then , critics inside the party have become more vocal .
while merkel has received praise on the foreign policy front , from her toughness on russian president vladimir putin , her reconciliation with us president george bush or her deft negations regarding the eu budget , at home , business and political leaders are questioning her policies and her style . lacki n g co n siste n cy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu leader ronald pofalla says it is time for a new path business-minded party members are complaining about the health care reform package saying it increases bureaucracy and labor costs in a country already at a disadvantage because it has to compete with low wages paid in its eastern eu neighbors . they say another example of the conservatives veering too far to the left is the widening of the social safety net : the coalition approved expanded benefits for the long-term unemployed and the " parent payment " to encourage couples to have babies . the most vocal bashing is reserved for the 3 percent rise in the value-added tax to 19 percent when the party leadership had long called for tax reform and tax cuts to spur economic growth . " many cdu supporters are disappointed over the direction the party is going in , " the cdu 's top official in brandenburg , jörg schönbohm , said in a recent interview in bild tabloid .
" moreover , that direction is not clear or consistent . " tur n i n g left ? the question many are asking these days is whether the party is abandoning some of its core principals in an attempt to increase approval ratings and appeal to more voters : elections in left-leaning berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania are just around the corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and her critics , such as jürgen rüttgers , are trying to make nice-nice one of the first things merkel said at the meeting tuesday was , " down with red-red , " referring to the coalition governments of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and the left party in berlin and mecklenburg-western pomerania . merkel won with a very small margin in september and the majority of germans still vote left .
also , she and her conservative colleagues watched as the spd lost one local election after another when its leader , then-chancellor gerhard schröder began implementing its reform program , agenda 2010 . that is probably why she is avoiding fights with her left-wing coalition partners and is not making the bold reforms promised while compromising more with the left than she should on policy , experts say . before the election , merkel was promising far bigger and more sweeping reforms than schröder , in an alliance with the free-market liberal free democratic party , wrote heribert prantl , who runs the national politics desk for süddeutsche zeitung . " but the conservative bloc pushing a neo-liberal agenda plummeted in the vote , " he wrote .
" the political caution that merkel now demonstrates stems directly from that shock : she comprehends that germans do not want bull-dozer style reforms . " even so , despite a slight economic recovery and a falling unemployment rate , cdu party leaders recognize there is much to do to revamp europe 's largest economy and deal with high unemployment , sluggish growth , demographic change and globalization .

the former leader of poland 's anti-communist solidarity trade union movement said : " this letter has convinced me and from this moment , i am no longer in conflict with mr. grass .
i think he 's explained himself sufficiently . " grass wrote : " in my blindness as a boy of 15 , i applied to serve on submarines , but i was not accepted .

but a number of prominent figures in poland have rallied to grass 's defense , including adam michnik , the editor in chief of the influential gazeta wyborcza daily , and archbishop jozef michalik , president of the polish episcopate . grass rose to fame with the publication in 1959 of " the tin drum , " which examined germany 's nazi legacy . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dossier : günter grass germany 's nobel prize winning author günter grass is facing a backlash from contemporaries and commentators after he admitted that he served in nazi germany 's notorious waffen ss .

that 's the point the united states has been trying to get across to iran in the debate over that country 's nuclear activity .
the us , like many europeans , believes tehran has been playing with a marked deck , and says the country has not earned the other players ' trust .
as a result , they say , the country needs to be sanctioned .
in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .
note , however , that tehran could have given the same answer three months ago .

in its august 22 response to an offer from the international community aimed at ending the long-running nuclear standoff , tehran called for " serious talks " but gave no indication it would freeze uranium enrichment , as demanded by the un security council . yet even though the details of the response have n't been revealed , tehran is once again left holding the bag , just because it refuses to fulfill its opponents ' expectations . fulfilling obligations for their part , the americans and europeans must acknowledge that they bent the rules in their favor in order to put pressure on iran .
for instance , us ambassador to the un john bolten announced that tehran needed to be stopped because it had breached the non-proliferation treaty .
such comments are taken without recourse , although this is exactly the point of disagreement in the nuclear debate . for years , iran has been fulfilling the obligations of the non-proliferation treaties it has signed .
but no one in washington , jerusalem , and at this point also brussels , seems to believe it .
why would such an oil-rich state be interested in atomic energy , they ask .
it must be a disguised attempt to develop nuclear weapons . it is a thesis that many find especially easy to believe , because for years the world has been watching tehran stall for time rather than work toward a solution .
and iran 's answer on tuesday appeared to be yet another such attempt . lack of proof but the answer - like the country 's delay tactics - does n't mean iran is necessarily seeking to build atomic weapons .
there is no proof that this is the case .
and therefore it would have been better for the un security council to have taken a conciliatory approach toward tehran , and not to have threatened tehran with an ultimatum .
that action simply gave a boost to hardliners in tehran and made it more difficult to find an agreement .
moreover , it cast the non-proliferation treaty itself into question .
what value does such a treaty have , if its rules can be interpreted at will and at whim ? the lack of progress in the nuclear debate can not - and should not - simply be attributed to one party .
the security council and germany have clearly been too openly pulled along in the wake of the usa , and as a result they have forgotten the basic rules of politics and diplomacy .
for its part , iran continues to drag its feet , has avoided making definitive statements , and has n't made much of an effort to eliminate the mistrust of foreign countries . nonetheless , tehran 's promise to begin immediate negotiations should be seen as a positive turn .

k chandrasekara rao and a narendra of the telangana rashtra samiti -lrb- trs -rrb- said they were unhappy with the federal government , led by the congress party .
the regional party , which has five mps in the parliament , has also withdrawn support to the ruling coalition .
analysts say this will not threaten the government as the coalition has a comfortable majority in the parliament .
trs has been demanding a separate state status for the telangana region in the southern state of andhra pradesh .
the two ministers said the government had not fulfilled its " assurance " for a separate telangana state .
the resignation letters of labour minister mr rao and junior rural development minister mr narendra have been sent to the prime minister , a party spokesman told the press trust of india .
" there can not be any solution to the problems faced by telangana people within the integrated state of andhra pradesh , " mr rao said .
he said mr rao has launched a hunger strike in the capital , delhi , from wednesday to press the demand for a separate telangana state .
the telangana region is spread over nine of the 23 districts of andhra pradesh and the separatists say economic development in their region has been neglected in favour of the richer and more powerful andhra region .
the demand for a separate state for the underdeveloped and drought prone region dates back 50 years but has been rejected by several federal governments .

the ozone layer blocks the sun 's ultra-violet rays , exposure to which is harmful to humans , animals and plants .
international agreements were reached to end the use of ozone-depleting chemicals called cfcs after the hole was discovered in 1986 .
it is hoped the hole may " heal " fully over the next 60 years .
two of the scientists whose work helped alert the world to the existence of a hole in the ozone layer in the 1980s told a conference in washington they were hopeful that the ozone layer was recovering .
" i 'm very optimistic that we will have a normal ozone layer sometime , not in my lifetime , but perhaps in yours , " said dr david hofman , who works for the us national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- as director of the global monitoring division .
dr susan solomon , of the intergovernmental panel on climate change , said she was also optimistic .
but she added : " there 's a lot more to be done from a scientific perspective in terms of what i would call accountability .
" i think it 's very important to make sure that we actually measure ozone - not only not getting any worse , but actually starting to improve , to be sure that the actions we have taken internationally have been effective . "
the two scientists reaffirmed their findings at a news conference to mark the 20th anniversary of their research first alerting the world to the problems of ozone-depleting cfcs .
treaty ' success ' the noaa said the improvement in the ozone layer was caused largely by the phasing out of cfcs -lrb- chlorofluorocarbons -rrb- from products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerators .
the production of these chemicals was restricted by the montreal protocol which became effective in 1987 - and is deemed a success .
the ozone layer filters out harmful ultra-violet radiation from the sun however , the chemicals brought in to replace cfcs are themselves not benign , and are thought to contribute heavily to global warming .
ozone is a molecule that is composed of three oxygen atoms .
it is responsible for filtering out harmful ultra-violet radiation -lrb- less than 290 nanometres -rrb- from the sun .
the gas is constantly being made and destroyed in the stratosphere , about 30 km -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- above the earth .
in an unpolluted atmosphere , this cycle of production and decomposition is in equilibrium .
but cfcs and the other montreal-restricted chemicals will rise into the stratosphere where they are broken down by the sun 's rays .
chlorine and bromine atoms released from the man-made products then act as catalysts to decompose ozone .
the thinning that occurs over the arctic has never matched that in the southern polar region and it is expected to recover sooner , sometime between 2030 and 2040 .

terje roed-larsen was speaking on a visit to jerusalem for talks with the israeli government .
the un says an international force is urgently needed to police the 10-day-old truce in lebanon .
but there have been few substantial offers of troops , and eu officials meet on wednesday to try to secure pledges .
' vacuum ' some 15,000 lebanese soldiers are being deployed mainly to southern lebanon , joining an existing force of some 2,000 un peacekeepers .
but the ceasefire has been tested by a number of skirmishes and an israeli commando raid deep inside lebanon , and mr roed-larsen said the situation remained fragile .
laptop link-up : ask lebanese villagers your questions " there is now a security vacuum which the lebanese government is trying to fill " with the help of international forces , mr roed-larsen told the news agency reuters in an interview in jerusalem .
" but i think realistically , up to a point , you will have such a vacuum in lebanon for the next two , three months , " he added .
" the situation is still extremely fragile ...
unintended incidents can kick off renewed violence , which might escalate and spin out of control . "
officials from european union member states are set to meet in brussels on wednesday to try to establish which countries are willing to contribute to the force .
and italy has succeeded in a call for an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers to be held on friday .
while italy has offered troops and leadership of the force , a task that was initially expected to go to france , it has demanded a fresh commitment from israel to respect the ceasefire .
israel attracted condemnation from the un and lebanon for a commando raid in the bekaa valley on saturday , and since the ceasefire took hold has clashed several times with alleged hezbollah fighters , resulting in several deaths .
the un has also expressed concern about israeli violations of lebanese airspace .
israel says such actions are defensive .
quick guide : hezbollah send us your views on tuesday , turkey said it might be willing to contribute soldiers but joined several other nations in expressing concerns about the clarity of the force 's mandate - and in particular whether peacekeepers will help disarm hezbollah guerrillas .
the us has rejected calls for an immediate new un resolution to lay down more precise terms for the force , with un envoy john bolton saying the priority is to get a force on the ground .
blockade row lebanon , meanwhile , continues to be subject to a sea and air blockade imposed by israel , with the exception of a limited number of flights , including aid and diplomatic missions .
in a meeting with the un 's mr roed-larsen on tuesday , israeli prime minister ehud olmert said the stationing of un troops along lebanon 's border with syria to stop the smuggling of arms to hezbollah would allow it to lift the blockade .
but syrian president bashar al-assad immediately rejected the idea , saying it would be interpreted as a " hostile act " .
in israel , prime minister olmert is facing increasing public pressure to approve an independent investigation into the war despite saying on monday he would not be party to " self-flagellation " .
senior members of the ruling coalition have backed the call for an investigation , demanded in an open letter signed by hundreds of israeli reservists .

but the ceasefire has been tested by a number of skirmishes and an israeli commando raid deep inside lebanon , and mr roed-larsen said the situation remained fragile .
laptop link-up : ask lebanese villagers your questions " there is now a security vacuum which the lebanese government is trying to fill " with the help of international forces , mr roed-larsen told the news agency reuters in an interview in jerusalem .
" but i think realistically , up to a point , you will have such a vacuum in lebanon for the next two , three months , " he added .
" the situation is still extremely fragile ...
unintended incidents can kick off renewed violence , which might escalate and spin out of control . "
officials from european union member states are set to meet in brussels on wednesday to try to establish which countries are willing to contribute to the force .
and italy has succeeded in a call for an emergency meeting of eu foreign ministers to be held on friday .
while italy has offered troops and leadership of the force , a task that was initially expected to go to france , it has demanded a fresh commitment from israel to respect the ceasefire .
israel attracted condemnation from the un and lebanon for a commando raid in the bekaa valley on saturday , and since the ceasefire took hold has clashed several times with alleged hezbollah fighters , resulting in several deaths .
the un has also expressed concern about israeli violations of lebanese airspace .
israel says such actions are defensive .
mid-east crisis : key maps quick guide : hezbollah send us your views on tuesday , turkey said it might be willing to contribute soldiers but joined several other nations in expressing concerns about the clarity of the force 's mandate - and in particular whether peacekeepers will help disarm hezbollah guerrillas .
the us has rejected calls for an immediate new un resolution to lay down more precise terms for the force , with un envoy john bolton saying the priority is to get a force on the ground .
blockade row lebanon , meanwhile , continues to be subject to a sea and air blockade imposed by israel , with the exception of a limited number of flights , including aid and diplomatic missions .
in a meeting with the un 's mr roed-larsen on tuesday , israeli prime minister ehud olmert said the stationing of un troops along lebanon 's border with syria to stop the smuggling of arms to hezbollah would allow it to lift the blockade .
but syrian president bashar al-assad immediately rejected the idea , saying it would be interpreted as a " hostile act " .
in israel , prime minister olmert is facing increasing public pressure to approve an independent investigation into the war despite saying on monday he would not be party to " self-flagellation " .
senior members of the ruling coalition have backed the call for an investigation , demanded in an open letter signed by hundreds of israeli reservists .

they decided to examine the issue after dairy farmers noticed their cows had slightly different moos , depending on which herd they came from .
john wells , professor of phonetics at the university of london , said regional twangs had been seen before in birds .

" it works the same as with dogs - the closer a farmer 's bond is with his animals , the easier it is for them to pick up his accent . "
peer pressure prof wells felt the accents could result from their contemporaries .
he said : " this phenomenon is well attested in birds .
you find distinct chirping accents in the same species around the country .
" this could also be true of cows .
" in small populations such as herds you would encounter identifiable dialectical variations which are most affected by the immediate peer group . "
dr jeanine treffers-daller , reader in linguistics at the university of the west of england in bristol , agreed that the accent could be influenced by relatives .

hundreds of the stinging lion 's mane variety have been washed up on the shores of county down .
crawfordsburn country park has put up signs warning of the threat .
joe breen of the environment and heritage service , said while they gave painful stings the jellyfish were not life threatening .
" as a diver you would certainly be very wary of them , they can give you a nasty , nasty sting , " he said .
" but if you are just swimming , certainly in shallow water , they pull their tentacles up so you are not really going to get a bad sting - you might come out with a bit of a rash like a nettle sting but nothing too serious - it wo n't kill you . "
he said that what was of more concern was the danger that young children walking along the beach may get hurt .
" i 've seen young children going along and saying ' a jellyfish , i 'll drop a stone on it ' not realising that by dropping a stone on it , it can actually splash , like a puddle , " he said .
" if you do get these stings in your eyes it could give you a seriously sore eye . "
the lion 's mane , which are red or rust coloured , are armed with an unpleasant sting that can be extremely painful .
the problem is not limited to the crawfordsburn area with smacks of up to 200 jellyfish being reported a little further up the lough .

" as a diver you would certainly be very wary of them , they can give you a nasty , nasty sting , " he said .
" but if you are just swimming , certainly in shallow water , they pull their tentacles up so you are not really going to get a bad sting - you might come out with a bit of a rash like a nettle sting but nothing too serious - it wo n't kill you . "
he said that what was of more concern was the danger that young children walking along the beach may get hurt .
the lion 's mane retracts it tentacles in shallow water -lrb- picture ehs -rrb- " i 've seen young children going along and saying ' a jellyfish , i 'll drop a stone on it ' not realising that by dropping a stone on it , it can actually splash , like a puddle , " he said .
" if you do get these stings in your eyes it could give you a seriously sore eye . "
the lion 's mane , which are red or rust coloured , are armed with an unpleasant sting that can be extremely painful .
the problem is not limited to the crawfordsburn area with smacks of up to 200 jellyfish being reported a little further up the lough .

the film studio told the wall street journal it had decided not to renew its deal with the star because " his recent conduct has not been acceptable " .
his opinions on use of anti-depressants and his relationship with katie holmes have made headlines in the past year .
but his business partner paula wagner said they chose to leave paramount .
she said cruise / wagner productions had been planning to set up independent financing for their films " for a long time " .
" for us this is a very new and exciting direction , " she told the associated press .
" we look forward to working with all the studios . "
acrimonious in a separate interview with the reuters news agency , ms wagner responded to comments made by sumner redstone , chairman of paramount 's parent company viacom , to the wall street journal .
" whatever remarks mr redstone would make about tom cruise personally or as an actor have no bearing on what this business issue is , " she said .
" there must be another agenda that the studio has in mind to take one of their greatest assets and malign him in this way . "
during the past decade , cruise 's films - which include the three mission : impossible movies - have generated more than $ 2 billion -lrb- £ 1.5 billion -rrb- worldwide .
but the third mission : impossible film put in a relatively disappointing performance at the box office .
