stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.07.2006 opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un force unifil has been stationed in lebanon since 1978 kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . in a situation of general helplessness , such as the current state of affairs in lebanon , it can happen that people seize upon ideas and plans whose ineffectiveness has long been proven . the suggestion now making the rounds is that an international un force is necessary to stabilize the southern lebanese region and prevent further attacks across the border .
but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .

but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

while some enjoyed the sun , deaths and forest fires marred the increasingly tropical summer . much of europe continued to bake in tropical temperatures as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , in a heat wave that on wednesday claimed its seventh victim since the start of the week . weather experts were predicting not only hot weather with bright sunshine but also rising humidity in germany , bringing a sweaty and uncomfortable muggy edge to the heat wave as the 2006 summer looked set to beat the 2003 season which broke records , unleashed havoc and resulted in around 30,000 fatalities , half of them in france . meteorologists in germany are warning their countrymen that thursday could be the hottest day in the year at 38 c , and july as a whole could be the hottest month in a century . the capital berlin , in the east of the country , was already facing 32 c on wednesday whereas its predecessor bonn , in the western rhine valley , was pushing 36 c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin shimmers in the heat local authorities were also warning germans of rising ozone levels expected in the coming days and an increased threat of fires in the many wooded areas of the country . europe-wide heatwave in the netherlands , two people succumbed to the heat on tuesday during the opening day of an annual four-day walk in the eastern nijmegen region , the dutch news agency anp reported .

an 85-year-old man died in hospital and a woman , 81 , at her home . around a quarter of france was affected by the heat wave on tuesday , predominately in the southwest . french authorities , who were accused of reacting too slowly to the tragic 2003 heat wave , were leaving little to chance this year , and hospitals and retirement homes were on high alert . prime minister dominique de villepin planned to visit a parisian retirement home on wednesday to demonstrate the measures the government was taking to care for the population vulnerable to the sweltering temperatures . in spain , a 44-year-old man died of heat exhaustion at orense , in the northwestern region of galicia , regional officials said , after he had reportedly been working outside as temperatures hit 41.5 c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is in flames again this summer temperatures soared to 41 c in some parts of southern portugal and are expected to rise above normal levels over the coming days , the national weather office said .
the soaring temperatures have been cited as the cause for the number of wild fires raging in six of mainland portugal 's 18 administrative districts : aveiro , beja , guarda , porto , santarem and viana do castelo . britain , already suffering the hottest day of the year on tuesday , was braced for its hottest day on record as forecasters predicted temperatures could reach 39 c in parts of england on wednesday .
the highest temperature ever recorded in britain was 38.5 c in the southern county of kent on august 10 , 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brits are taking to the pool to cope the london underground system , the oldest in the world , was a furnace on tuesday with a record temperature of 47 c. bus passengers fared even worse , with temperatures on buses in the city of london , the main financial district , reaching 52 c. local authorities in britain poured gravel on roads to counteract the effects of melting asphalt , and at a zoo in colchester , lions were given ice cubes flavored with blood . italy 's main farmers ' union said the country was suffering one of the worst droughts in 30 years with the situation in the north and the center particularly bad . water levels in the lakes of northern italy have fallen to historic low levels , making the irrigation of crops difficult , the coldiretti union said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe heats up according to a new report by europe 's leading environment agency , the continent only has 50 years to adapt to changing weather conditions with three-quarters of europe 's glaciers expected to melt .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .

while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin one year after the 2005 g8 summit , 19 countries have seen their debts to the world bank , imf and african development fund cancelled , releasing about $ 1 billion a year for poverty reduction , say actionaid officials .
they are calling for the deal to be extended to another 40 of the poorest countries .
partners should be pleased merkel 's focus on poverty and energy security with a nod to the environment should please many of the center-left social democrats in her coalition government , say observers .
her credibility within the eu and with the us gives her a leg up . " she uses strong language on things that are important to the us , " said riecke .
" she won respect for her leadership in sorting out eu finances .
and her focus on certain issues next year might be instruments to please the leftists .

" there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power .

" merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin one year after the 2005 g8 summit , 19 countries have seen their debts to the world bank , imf and african development fund cancelled , releasing about $ 1 billion a year for poverty reduction , say actionaid officials .
they are calling for the deal to be extended to another 40 of the poorest countries .
partners should be pleased merkel 's focus on poverty and energy security with a nod to the environment should please many of the center-left social democrats in her coalition government , say observers .
her credibility within the eu and with the us gives her a leg up . " she uses strong language on things that are important to the us , " said riecke .
" she won respect for her leadership in sorting out eu finances .
and her focus on certain issues next year might be instruments to please the leftists . " that will be a powerful starting position because she wo n't be able to turn anything around without support abroad and at home , " he added . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview .
-lrb- july 14 , 2006 -rrb- g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business airbus to unveil new a350 plane design high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 19.07.2006 european commission proposes air fare transparency rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers often do n't get the bargains they are expecting when buying air tickets the european commission has proposed that air fares should be more transparent and clearly include all extra charges so that passengers know exactly what they 're getting and how much it will all cost . the plans would do away with a common practice in the industry of touting air fares decoupled from a host of other hidden fees , taxes and other extra charges that are frequently added on only when the would-be passenger has made it to the payment phase . additional charges added on to air fares often include fuel surcharges , insurance and various taxes and can sometimes double the price .
for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 19.07.2006 exotic escapees fill germany 's sizzling summer hole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he end up taking home the title of germany 's 2006 summer hole star ?
stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .
we 'll keep you updated .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent .

since then , the museum has welcomed exhibitions from places like the tokyo national museum and the metropolitan museum . a fraction of guggenheim 's holdings while many of the guggenheim 's greatest pieces will be in show in bonn , the extensive collection will be just a fraction of the number of works the guggenheim foundation actually has in its museums .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on business airbus to unveil new a350 plane design high priced raw materials make recycled rubbish attractive major management shake-up at bmw german family firm fights off tourism giants business -pipe- 19.07.2006 european commission proposes air fare transparency rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers often do n't get the bargains they are expecting when buying air tickets the european commission has proposed that air fares should be more transparent and clearly include all extra charges so that passengers know exactly what they 're getting and how much it will all cost . the plans would do away with a common practice in the industry of touting air fares decoupled from a host of other hidden fees , taxes and other extra charges that are frequently added on only when the would-be passenger has made it to the payment phase . additional charges added on to air fares often include fuel surcharges , insurance and various taxes and can sometimes double the price .
for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .
we 'll keep you updated .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .

the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin one year after the 2005 g8 summit , 19 countries have seen their debts to the world bank , imf and african development fund cancelled , releasing about $ 1 billion a year for poverty reduction , say actionaid officials .
they are calling for the deal to be extended to another 40 of the poorest countries .
partners should be pleased merkel 's focus on poverty and energy security with a nod to the environment should please many of the center-left social democrats in her coalition government , say observers .
her credibility within the eu and with the us gives her a leg up . " she uses strong language on things that are important to the us , " said riecke .
" she won respect for her leadership in sorting out eu finances .
and her focus on certain issues next year might be instruments to please the leftists . " that will be a powerful starting position because she wo n't be able to turn anything around without support abroad and at home , " he added . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview .
-lrb- july 14 , 2006 -rrb- g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .
-lrb- july 17 , 2006 -rrb- german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

earlier this month , the government of abu dhabi , the capital of the united arab emirates , announced its plans to build a 300,000-square-foot museum to be called the guggenheim abu dhabi . the new museum will be designed by frank gehry , the man behind the guggenheim bilbao in spain whose works will also be exhibited in bonn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the guggenheim collection comes to germany the art and exhibition hall in bonn is showing works from the guggenheim collection from july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.07.2006 opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un force unifil has been stationed in lebanon since 1978 kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . in a situation of general helplessness , such as the current state of affairs in lebanon , it can happen that people seize upon ideas and plans whose ineffectiveness has long been proven . the suggestion now making the rounds is that an international un force is necessary to stabilize the southern lebanese region and prevent further attacks across the border .
but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .
but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .

she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.07.2006 opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un force unifil has been stationed in lebanon since 1978 kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . in a situation of general helplessness , such as the current state of affairs in lebanon , it can happen that people seize upon ideas and plans whose ineffectiveness has long been proven . the suggestion now making the rounds is that an international un force is necessary to stabilize the southern lebanese region and prevent further attacks across the border .
but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 19.07.2006 exotic escapees fill germany 's sizzling summer hole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will he end up taking home the title of germany 's 2006 summer hole star ?
stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.07.2006 opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un force unifil has been stationed in lebanon since 1978 kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp . in a situation of general helplessness , such as the current state of affairs in lebanon , it can happen that people seize upon ideas and plans whose ineffectiveness has long been proven . the suggestion now making the rounds is that an international un force is necessary to stabilize the southern lebanese region and prevent further attacks across the border .
but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .
but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .

all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin one year after the 2005 g8 summit , 19 countries have seen their debts to the world bank , imf and african development fund cancelled , releasing about $ 1 billion a year for poverty reduction , say actionaid officials .
they are calling for the deal to be extended to another 40 of the poorest countries .
partners should be pleased merkel 's focus on poverty and energy security with a nod to the environment should please many of the center-left social democrats in her coalition government , say observers .
her credibility within the eu and with the us gives her a leg up . " she uses strong language on things that are important to the us , " said riecke .
" she won respect for her leadership in sorting out eu finances .
and her focus on certain issues next year might be instruments to please the leftists . " that will be a powerful starting position because she wo n't be able to turn anything around without support abroad and at home , " he added . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .

contemporary exhibits from the 1990s onwards will include photography and video installations . art and architecture on the road the second exhibition " the guggenheim : architecture " at the kunst- und ausstellungshalle , will run from august 25 until november 12 this year and include 25 projects by 15 architects who have designed projects for the guggenheim foundation , many of which have been built and some that have not yet been realized . bildunterschrift : architectural concept for the guggenheim museum in rio de janeiro the architecture exhibition will be the first to show architectural commissions and design competitions commissioned for the guggenheim and will feature designs by frank lloyd wright , zaha hadid , rem koolhaas and jean nouvel . the arrival of " the guggenheim : architecture " is the latest of a series of exhibitions honoring the museum 's hosting of big museum collections which started 14 years ago with a show of works from new york 's museum of modern art .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power .

she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .

contemporary exhibits from the 1990s onwards will include photography and video installations . art and architecture on the road the second exhibition " the guggenheim : architecture " at the kunst- und ausstellungshalle , will run from august 25 until november 12 this year and include 25 projects by 15 architects who have designed projects for the guggenheim foundation , many of which have been built and some that have not yet been realized . bildunterschrift : architectural concept for the guggenheim museum in rio de janeiro the architecture exhibition will be the first to show architectural commissions and design competitions commissioned for the guggenheim and will feature designs by frank lloyd wright , zaha hadid , rem koolhaas and jean nouvel . the arrival of " the guggenheim : architecture " is the latest of a series of exhibitions honoring the museum 's hosting of big museum collections which started 14 years ago with a show of works from new york 's museum of modern art .
since then , the museum has welcomed exhibitions from places like the tokyo national museum and the metropolitan museum . a fraction of guggenheim 's holdings while many of the guggenheim 's greatest pieces will be in show in bonn , the extensive collection will be just a fraction of the number of works the guggenheim foundation actually has in its museums .
over the past 16 years the foundation 's collections have doubled in size and the traveling exhibitions in bonn will represent less than four percent of its total holdings . bildunterschrift : the guggenheim museum in bilbao such is the rate of expansion of the global network of guggenheim museums and its collections that the foundation is looking to extend its reach further .
earlier this month , the government of abu dhabi , the capital of the united arab emirates , announced its plans to build a 300,000-square-foot museum to be called the guggenheim abu dhabi . the new museum will be designed by frank gehry , the man behind the guggenheim bilbao in spain whose works will also be exhibited in bonn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the guggenheim collection comes to germany the art and exhibition hall in bonn is showing works from the guggenheim collection from july .

but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .
that is if peace and security can really be secured by a strong international force in the first place . peter philipp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world .

" there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .
some even blamed germany 's loss to the italians in the semi-finals on the bear 's demise - after all , he 'd come from italy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's so hard to survive summer without them now that bruno 's gone and the world cup is over , newspapers , tv and radio stations and - yes - the odd web site are scrambling to find stories that will fill the famous " summer hole " - the pending break from politics and absence of thrilling parliamentary sessions that can keep people entertained for hours , as everyone knows . germany 's biggest tabloid , bild , which called for free raspberry ice cream a few summer holes ago , has already found its filler for 2006 .
the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

earlier this month , the government of abu dhabi , the capital of the united arab emirates , announced its plans to build a 300,000-square-foot museum to be called the guggenheim abu dhabi . the new museum will be designed by frank gehry , the man behind the guggenheim bilbao in spain whose works will also be exhibited in bonn . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the guggenheim collection comes to germany the art and exhibition hall in bonn is showing works from the guggenheim collection from july .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

and she is already mulling over some new priorities for next year 's meeting , even though the current one just ended . because for merkel , who will also take over the eu presidency in january , 2007 promises to be an opportunity to bring a change of direction to europe and the world . " with -lrb- france 's jacques -rrb- chirac and -lrb- british prime minister tony -rrb- blair likely gone , she will be in a powerful position in leadership circles , " said henning riecke , a researcher at the german council on foreign relations .
" her negotiating style plays well with other leaders and she has already had a good start on the international stage . " russian leader left a stamp russian president vladimir putin chaired this year 's g8 summit in st. petersburg in a bold and determined manner , showing that russia is regaining its place on the world stage . " there has been nothing quiet or unassuming about the way in which russia 's president has chaired the g8 , " wrote larry elliot , economics editor of the british daily the guardian after the summit .
" putin has swaggered through the meeting - doling out insults to blair and bush - in an attempt to show that russia has regained its status as a great power . " and even though he tried to focus this year 's meeting on a topic dear to his heart - energy - events on the ground turned attention elsewhere , namely , the middle east . different priorities merkel promises to be a different type of host when she welcomes the g8 next june to the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm .
she has less to prove than putin , say experts , since germany is already a solid , stable democracy , a member of the eu and europe 's largest economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel does n't want the g8 expanded her priorities are also different .
she has said she will focus on poverty , and while it is thought she will make energy a priority , her emphasis will be on sustainable , renewable and environmentally sound energy strategies . " the meeting 's agenda is not set yet , " she told reporters in russia .
" of course , it will include a struggle against poverty .
the topics will depend on the situation in the world then and will probably include a discussion on iran , the middle east conflict - perhaps we will consider a subject not yet discussed by the g8 . " riecke said that with merkel as g8 chair , she will be able to end german isolation on certain issues . " this year , the germans were isolated in their views on energy and the environment but she will be able to push those views forward next year , " he said .
" and she will probably tilt the focus more towards the east . " she is also a less brash , more careful politician than putin , or even blair , who chaired the 2005 g8 meeting and also called for prioritizing the fight against poverty . " merkel has shown signs that she is ready - in her quiet , unassuming way - to take germany in a different direction , " elliot wrote .
" her willingness to listen to blair over the stalled trade talks and the forging of closer links with the smaller countries of the european union suggest that she does n't see the berlin-paris axis as the be-all and end-all of german foreign policy .
the fact that germany , so often the tail-end charlie when it comes to debt relief and aid , has agreed to put africa on the agenda at next summer 's g8 is also significant . " welcome news many have applauded merkel 's plans . " after g8 leaders promised to make poverty history last year , this summit has been -lrb- worthless -rrb- , " said patrick watt , policy coordinator with actionaid uk .
" it now falls to germany to get the g8 back on track to double aid for africa and provide aids treatment .
it 's good news that chancellor merkel is putting africa on the agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin one year after the 2005 g8 summit , 19 countries have seen their debts to the world bank , imf and african development fund cancelled , releasing about $ 1 billion a year for poverty reduction , say actionaid officials .
they are calling for the deal to be extended to another 40 of the poorest countries .
partners should be pleased merkel 's focus on poverty and energy security with a nod to the environment should please many of the center-left social democrats in her coalition government , say observers .
her credibility within the eu and with the us gives her a leg up . " she uses strong language on things that are important to the us , " said riecke .
" she won respect for her leadership in sorting out eu finances .
and her focus on certain issues next year might be instruments to please the leftists . " that will be a powerful starting position because she wo n't be able to turn anything around without support abroad and at home , " he added . jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " we can not solve problems without russia " the german government 's russian policy expert , andreas schockenhoff was in russia before the upcoming g8 summit .
he talked with dw-world.de in an exclusive interview .
-lrb- july 14 , 2006 -rrb- g8 leaders end summit with focus on trade the leaders of the group of eight ended their three-day summit in russia with a push to salvage global free-trade talks that are teetering on the verge of collapse .

but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .
but the force ca n't take credit for that .
the plo is no longer a factor in the region anymore .
it has long since been replaced by hezbollah .
and the central lebanese government still does n't control southern lebanon . peacekeeping is only possible if all agree to it normally , all parties in a conflict have to agree to the deployment of such an international force .
in israel 's case , it 's apparent who has to endorse such a force . but that is n't the case with lebanon . does the central lebanese government have to agree to it or hezbollah ?
and what if hezbollah disagrees ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hezbollah would have to agree to a un deployment promoting peace against the will of those involved is impossible , though maybe a ceasefire could work at the very least .
but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .
they know that those who yell the loudest will be called on first . in the case of germany , its special relation to israel ca n't be an excuse , but rather an obligation .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .

" airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .

the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .

in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?

the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .
" kuno , the killer catfish " allegedly devoured a dachshund in 2001 , although that accusation could never be substantiated . this year 's co n te n ders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't attempt to eat heidelberg 's python but that was then .
in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .
we 'll keep you updated .

" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .
the airline will charge extra for luggage , there 'll be a fuel surcharge and various other taxes . advertised prices soon increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased competition means prices get slashed the price will have increased by at least 40 euros before you even get to the departure lounge , and sometimes the cheapest of flights may turn out to be as expensive as a regular journey . the commission wants to change that by forcing airlines to display their air fares including all the extra charges , enabling the consumer to decide quickly and easily whether they have spotted a bargain .
air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said . " citizens must enjoy the benefits of the -lrb- eu -rrb- single market and have the possibility for more choice and quality , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said in a statement .
" they must be able to easily compare fares between airlines . " airlines welcome eu plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they may have paid more than they had hoped ryanair , one of the airlines which was specifically named by the commission of being guilty of the practice , released a statement saying it welcomed the commission 's proposals to make air fares more transparent . " all passengers who book and fly with ryanair already receive a full breakdown of fares , taxes and charges before they are allowed to make a booking , " it said in a statement . eu officials said a ryanair advert on its web site selling 4 million seats from 19 pence excluding taxes , fees and charges , would in principle not be allowed under the new rules because the advertised price was not the final cost . " the fare shown or price shown should be the price the passenger pays , " barrot 's spokesman , stefaan de rynck , told a brussels press conference .
he added that the problem of misleading advertising was not limited to the low-fare sector and was prevalent throughout the industry . plans will punish offenders the plans have yet to be approved by eu transport ministers and the european parliament .
only when they have been agreed upon by the bureaucrats in brussels can they go into effect . they would also give the commission authority to revoke or suspend airlines ' licenses if they did not follow eu rules for operating , such as safety or financial standards . the plans are part of a broader aviation package which aims to streamline the regulations governing how airlines operate , the financial conditions they have to meet , and also how they are monitored by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .
-lrb- july 17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ?
kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- " the lebanese people are paying the price of the war " sami nader , an international relations teacher at st. joseph university in beirut , spoke with dw-world.de about the situation on the ground in lebanon and the motivation behind the continuing violence in the middle east .

it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .

for passengers using the plethora of cheap airlines in europe , it 's a problem which is all too familiar . according to the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , the liberalization of air transport is one of europe 's bigger success stories .
it is now cheaper than ever to travel by air , and more and more europeans can afford it . small wonder then that the brussels-based commission wants to stop unscrupulous airlines from deceiving consumers with misleading advertisements . an airline may offer to fly its passengers from berlin to london for one cent but it is highly unlikely that anyone will get airborne for that modest sum .

air passengers were failing to reap the benefits of increasing competition on european routes in recent years because of the practice , the commission said .

but no one can say what kind of a mandate such troops could and should have , how large the force should be or how it will be put together .
all we know for certain is that the warring parties israel and hezbollah do n't agree with it - at least not at present . of course , a similar force has actually existed for years in the region : unifil , the un interim force in lebanon .
ever since its establishment in march 1978 , it has shown how permanent such " interim solutions " can sometimes be - and also , how little it can really achieve . unifil watched idly from the sidelines unifil 's task was to enable the israeli withdrawal from the region , create international peace and security , as well as aid the lebanese government in re-establishing its authority in the entire country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un peacekeeper patrols the border region in lebanon an initial 4,500 troops - today totaling 2,000 soldiers - from countries such as france , fiji , china , poland or india set up roadblocks and searched cars for weapons and explosives . the force however could n't prevent larger conflicts , but rather had to watch idly when the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- launched attacks on israel and israeli troops marched into southern lebanon - and later when the the war in lebanon broke out . all the same , 22 years after unifil was stationed in the region , israel did withdraw from lebanon in 2000 .

but that would presume that such an international force would aim for its goal with military power if need be and would have to stand up against hezbollah and israel .
that 's certainly no task for 2,000 lightly armed unifil soldiers . unifil has over the years suffered some 250 casualties .
and a force that 's thrust into action is exposed to far greater dangers .
those calling for one should consider this .

while some enjoyed the sun , deaths and forest fires marred the increasingly tropical summer . much of europe continued to bake in tropical temperatures as high as 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , in a heat wave that on wednesday claimed its seventh victim since the start of the week . weather experts were predicting not only hot weather with bright sunshine but also rising humidity in germany , bringing a sweaty and uncomfortable muggy edge to the heat wave as the 2006 summer looked set to beat the 2003 season which broke records , unleashed havoc and resulted in around 30,000 fatalities , half of them in france . meteorologists in germany are warning their countrymen that thursday could be the hottest day in the year at 38 c , and july as a whole could be the hottest month in a century . the capital berlin , in the east of the country , was already facing 32 c on wednesday whereas its predecessor bonn , in the western rhine valley , was pushing 36 c. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin shimmers in the heat local authorities were also warning germans of rising ozone levels expected in the coming days and an increased threat of fires in the many wooded areas of the country . europe-wide heatwave in the netherlands , two people succumbed to the heat on tuesday during the opening day of an annual four-day walk in the eastern nijmegen region , the dutch news agency anp reported .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .
but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda .

kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .

" this morning , 3,000 germans who want to leave gathered in beirut , " martin jäger told reporters in berlin , adding that many of them held both lebanese and german passports . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek citizens wait to board a cruise ship in the port of beirut the german embassy in the lebanese capital has organized more than 50 buses to take most of the germans to the syrian capital damascus , from where they will be flown to germany on charter flights .
others will travel to cyprus on board a french ferry evacuating europeans who are fleeing the violence in lebanon .
on wednesday , a cruise liner carrying more than 1,000 us citizens also left beirut for cyprus .
at least 25,000 americans are currently in lebanon . the german government has organized three charter flights from damascus , while the army was preparing to fly to adana in southern turkey to fetch other germans wishing to come home .
jäger said that 700 germans had already fled the country since last wednesday when israel launched a deadly bombing campaign on its northern neighbor in a bid to flush out hezbollah militants .
while 320 people arrived in düsseldorf on tuesday , another 188 germans landed in munich on wednesday as 100 people made their way home via a stop-over in hungary . he added that the german government was " very concerned about the humanitarian situation in lebanon " and had on wednesday made available a million euros in emergency relief to beirut . there were chaotic scenes at beirut 's waterfront on wednesday as swamped embassy staff struggled to prioritize the crowds turning up at staging posts near the port as israeli missiles and shells exploded just a couple of kilometres -lrb- barely a mile -rrb- away , sending loud booms echoing across the smoke-shrouded skyline . chirac calls for " huma n itaria n corridor " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac french president jacques chirac meanwhile demanded the creation of " humanitarian corridors " in lebanon that would allow refugees to travel safely within the country as well as on their way to cyprus . officials for the united nation 's children 's fund -lrb- unicef -rrb- and the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- also called for such a corridor to transport the injured and deliver aid packages .
they said that the destruction of lebanese infrastructure by israeli air raids had made it more difficult to bring aid to those in need . germa n s call o n a n n a n to report o n situatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bridge damaged by israeli missiles in beirut german leaders on wednesday were also trying to defuse the situation and called on israel to exercise restraint . government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that while israel 's right to defend itself was justified , jerusalem had to watch the proportionality of its actions and spare civilians and infrastructure . wilhelm added that the german government agreed that radical forces had to be stopped from toppling the region into chaos .
the kidnapping of two israeli soldiers , which prompted israel 's military action , had to be ended before israel would stop its raids . he also said that the german government called on un secretary general kofi annan to present a report on the situation to allow the un security council to take action on a possible un peacekeeping mission . the united nations is mulling a mandate for a new international force in lebanon that would be considerably bigger than the 2,000-strong one currently deployed there , following a proposal from the leaders of the g8 group . fischer : new un force will n ot work but former german foreign minister joschka fischer , who won the confidence of both israelis and palestinians during his time in office , said on wednesday that it would make " little sense " to deploy a bigger un force in lebanon to stabilize the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " only a robust force with a robust mandate could perhaps achieve something positive , " he told the weekly paper die zeit , due out on thursday .
" i think it is far more important to put political pressure on the radicals and to commit ourselves to new peace negotiations . " fischer described israel 's eight-day-old offensive as a war . " beirut is under siege , haifa also , " he said .
" on both sides people are dying in military violence .
this is war . " he added that the violence had been " orchestrated by foreign leaders of hamas as part of their struggle with the moderate elements in the movement . " but iran and syria also had a hand in the events , he added . fischer did not respond to a suggestion made by daniel cohn-bendit , french-german green party representative in the european parliament , that he be called on to mediate in the crisis . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un shapes plans for lebanon force un chief kofi annan has said he expects european participation in a un stabilization force in the middle east .
but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda .

kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .

but for germany , the issue is not yet on the agenda . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has left open the extent of german involvement in the planned un stabilization force in lebanon .
" let 's not take the fourth step before we 've taken the first one , " steinmeier said in berlin .
beforehand , there has to be a concrete proposal , the consent of the conflict parties and a un mandate , he said . un secretary general kofi annan discussed the plans in brussels with european union foreign policy chief javier solana on tuesday , who has since returned to the region .
if approved by the un security council , the proposed new un stabilization force would be much bigger than the current 2,000-strong un presence in the country , annan said . european commission president jose barroso said that a number of eu countries stand ready to participate in such a force . " this is crucially important and we hope that we can help the parties avoid an escalation of violence , " said barroso .
" we are very concerned with the situation there . " annan welcomed the eu commitment . " i would expect contributions from the european countries and countries from other regions , " annan said . german participation is not on the agenda steinmeier said annan 's recommendation for a un force in the buffer zone between israel and lebanon would offer an opportunity to ease the conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un chief annan spoke with chancellor merkel at the g8 summit in st. petersburg " i take this as a contribution to stabilizing the situation , " steinmeier said .
once the necessary conditions were in place , the eu would fulfil its responsibilities , he said . " if this is a solution to end the violence in the region , then the european union will not be able to ignore the demands of the international community , " steinmeier said . however , which eu countries will be part of the force is still to be decided .
chancellor angela merkel had said at the g8 summit in st. petersburg that german participation in a middle east mission was currently not an issue . " this is absolutely not on the agenda at this time , " merkel said . curing the symptoms , not the cause the foreign policy spokesman of the social democrats parliamentary faction gert weisskirchen said he did n't see willingness to accept a peacekeeping force either on the lebanese or on the israeli side at present .
but in principle , annan 's concept was " a conceivable solution , " he said . eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative christian democrats in parliament , said many questions still needed to be resolved .
otherwise , it would simply be a case of " curing the symptoms , " von klaeden said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where do hezbollah 's weapons come from ?
the relations between hezbollah and the lebanese government , as well as iran 's massive armament of hezbollah were problematic , he said . for the opposition greens , a ceasefire was a necessary condition for deploying a peacekeeping force .
the " disproportionate " strikes by israel had to cease , as did the rocket attacks by hezbollah , said green deputy leader jürgen trittin . german government has to take active role the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee will convene for a special session on thursday to discuss the situation in the middle east .
the opposition left party is pushing for a clear position by the federal government . " the middle east is virtually in a state of war , " said wolfgang gehrcke , the party 's committee representative .
" it ca n't be that the german government simply watches from the sidelines . "
the government had to take an active role in resolving the conflict , he said . meanwhile , the german red cross on tuesday said it would donate 200,000 euros -lrb- $ 250,000 -rrb- to help victims of israeli air strikes in lebanon .
the money will be used to buy medicine and emergency food and hygiene supplies , the organization said . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : eu mediation in middle east requires a common line the israeli army has said its offensive to defeat hezbollah could last several weeks .
yet time is running out for international diplomatic intervention .
what role could the european union play in the negotiation process ?
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- by land and sea , europeans flee lebanon for their lives helicopters and warships , chartered ferries and passenger vessels have arrived in lebanon to pick up tens of thousands of people in one of the biggest mass evacuations since world war ii .
-lrb- july 18 , 2006 -rrb- eu renews call for restraint in middle east european union foreign ministers are scrambling to find diplomatic solutions to halt the fighting between israel and hezbollah , as the escalating crisis risks setting the middle east aflame .
-lrb- july 17 , 2006 -rrb- opinion : can a un force accomplish anything ?
kofi annan 's proposal to deploy a large scale un stabilization force to the middle east has met with resistance and skepticism in the security council - for good reason , says deutsche welle 's peter philipp .
-lrb- july 19 , 2006 -rrb- " the lebanese people are paying the price of the war " sami nader , an international relations teacher at st. joseph university in beirut , spoke with dw-world.de about the situation on the ground in lebanon and the motivation behind the continuing violence in the middle east .

stories about exotic animals on the run are almost a given as public life shuts down over the summer .
but germany 's so-called " summer hole " can not be the only explanation for the rise in homeless creatures this year . from the media 's news flow perspective , bruno 's timing was exceptionally bad .
the young brown bear , who became the first of its kind to appear in bavaria in almost two centuries , showed up just as the country was getting ready to go wild with the soccer world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno shortly before his death nevertheless , his month-long odyssey and eventual death by shooting after bavarian officials had deemed him a threat to sheep , goats and humans alike made national headlines .

the paper 's launched a campaign that wants germans to drop the formal " sie " for the informal " du " when addressing others . no respect for stardom while such exaggerated friendliness might still be light years away despite the new post-world cup germany , some people in the country stand a good chance of cozying up to this year 's escaped animal stars . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't be surprised if you run into her in northern germany this summer maybe it 's the desert-like heat that has set animals on the run in droves .
in any case , they certainly do n't seem to have any respect for the concept of summer hole star any longer and are now competing for media attention .
in 1994 , germans collectively held their breath because of " killer caiman sammy , " who was waiting for victims in a lake .
after six days , the poor thing was rescued with hypothermia and eventually returned to a quiet life at his owner 's home . in 1998 , manni the escaped wallaby was less of a threat and more of an amusement as it hopped its way across germany .

in 2006 , there 's at least two iguanas - one from hamburg and another in bottrop in western germany - that are vying for summer hole attention .
in northern germany , a kangaroo mother and its baby keep evading authorities while an angler in heidelberg insists that he 's spotted a three-meter-long -lrb- three yards -rrb- python in the neckar river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cute , but not necessarily known for speed and then there 's christa , the giant turtle , who escaped from a circus that 's currently performing in a town in saxony . now , we do n't know about you , but christa 's escape sounds like a perfect marketing trick to us as turtles are n't exactly known for their speedy pace . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why run away when you can get frozen fruit delivered to your doorstep ?
besides , it seems that christa and the others should really know better as they 'd probably be fed delicious frozen fruits and doused with cold showers like animals at german zoos usually are if they 'd only chosen to stay at home . let 's blame it on the heat .

the british oil firm said they had been shut while the allegations were being investigated .
the 12 wells being shut at prudhoe bay , north star , and milne point fields pump a combined 8,000 barrels of oil a day .
bp 's move comes as the firm could face a criminal investigation in the us over a massive oil spill in alaska in march .
it is under investigation by a grand jury over the spill of some 267,000 gallons -lrb- 1 million litres -rrb- discovered at the prudhoe bay field , and the largest ever on alaska 's north slope region .
' arctic pack ' the leaking liquids in the latest claims are a freeze protection material used in well cellars .
the material known as " arctic pack " , is usually crude oil or diesel fuel added to the well .
none of the leaked material had reached the arctic tundra , the firm said .
the recently appointed head of bp 's us operations , robert malone , has made cleaning up the firm 's public image a top priority .
bp says mr malone has ordered that an ombudsman should be employed by september to independently deal with staff concerns about environmental or safety issues .

the world record for the largest group of people with the same surname is held by sweden with 583 norbergs and s4c is trying to outdo that .
the audience entirely composed of joneses will enjoy a variety show starring a host of famous joneses .
the announcement was made in blaenau ffestiniog , home to the highest proportion of joneses in the uk .
the show , jones jones jones , will feature music , dance , comedy performances and special guest appearances .
guinness world record officials will also attend to validate the record-breaking attempt .
it is estimated that about nine-tenths of people in wales answer to a total of 100 names , including thomas , davies , owen , lloyd , williams , griffiths and jones .
it tends to immediately identify my welshness .
always a good conversation starter , that !
actor ruth jones jones is one of the most popular , and is thought to derive from the middle english first name jon -lrb- e -rrb- .
it is shared by many welsh celebrities , including the singer sir tom and swansea-born film star catherine zeta .
blue peter presenter gethin jones is hoping to be a part of the record-breaking attempt .
' extremely proud ' gethin , 28 , from cardiff , said : " i 'm extremely proud to be a jones , it reflects my pride in my family 's roots in ceredigion and carmarthenshire in west wales .
" my sister even kept her maiden name when she got married , " he added .
gethin , who said his biggest " jones hero " was welsh rugby international cliff jones , said the name did have its drawbacks .
" i 'm always being mistaken for other joneses .
the t4 presenter steve jones and i are often mixed up and receive each other 's mail .
" but i love the surname .
i think it has a certain kudos , " he added .
' historical event ' one of the show 's producers , neville hughes of cwmni da said : " the jones clan has proved its talent in various fields - singers , actors , presenters , sportsmen and women .
" we 're determined to bring as many of them together , from wales and beyond , to be a part of this historical event and create a memorable show the whole of wales can be proud of . "
ruth jones , who plays myfanwy - barmaid friend of " only gay in the village " dafydd in the bbc 's little britain , said she loved the " anonymity " of her surname .
she said : " it tends to immediately identify my welshness .
always a good conversation starter , that !
" when i was growing up i used to love -lsb- the itv television comedy -rsb- rising damp because frances de la tour 's character name was ruth jones .
i suppose i do like it when i meet another jones , like we 're part of a clan - even though our name is so common ! "
tickets for the jones jones jones show are on sale from the wales millennium centre ticket office priced at £ 15 , with concessions £ 10 and £ 5 .
priority will be given to joneses , who will need to bring a passport or driver 's licence as proof of identity on the night .

they have come to hunt for their staple diet of salmon and seals in increasingly large numbers .
boat skipper brian meharg is one man who has had a close encounter while on a trip across the north channel to scotland .
" everything was going well , and i was steering the boat at the time when i noticed on my starboard side this massive fin about 100 metres away , " he says .
" it was quite a shock because i 've seen quite a lot in my time - dolphins , porpoises , basking sharks - but this fin was four or five feet out of the water and travelling at quite a speed .

" they 've been seen in lough foyle , whitepark bay and as recently as four weeks ago off portmuck , " he says .
" they 're pretty much unmistakable - in the male , the dorsal fin can be six or seven feet in height , so there 's very few whales or dolphins you would confuse it with . "
he says that despite their scary name , we have little to fear from the giant mammals .
" they certainly have earned a reputation for being dangerous , partly because they feed on other large mammals such as seals or porpoises , which we do find close to the shore .
" they are also highly intelligent and inquisitive animals .
" unlike whales or dolphins , they wo n't be put off by boat traffic - they will come close .
" they have a perhaps unfair reputation as being dangerous as they are n't easily intimidated . "
bbc northern ireland 's rural affairs correspondent martin cassidy said that there have been no reports of whales attacking swimmers or boats , and indeed , we pose more of a risk to them .
" fishing gear poses the greatest danger , as they could become ensnared in the fine mesh of fishermen 's nets , " he said .
" pollution can be another problem for them - it comes with the territory of being top of the food chain , as chemicals consumed by their prey all get passed on to the whale .
" conservationists are encouraged by the numbers of killer whales now being seen .
" is global warming driving them further north in search of colder waters ?
" it is too early to say , but the irish whale and dolphin group is collating sightings - if you do spot any killer whales this summer you can visit their website , www.iwdg.ie , and get in touch . "

they have come to hunt for their staple diet of salmon and seals in increasingly large numbers .
boat skipper brian meharg is one man who has had a close encounter while on a trip across the north channel to scotland .
" everything was going well , and i was steering the boat at the time when i noticed on my starboard side this massive fin about 100 metres away , " he says .
" it was quite a shock because i 've seen quite a lot in my time - dolphins , porpoises , basking sharks - but this fin was four or five feet out of the water and travelling at quite a speed .

gary burrows of the environment and heritage service says they have been spotted all around the irish coast in the past three years .

this killer whale was pictured 10 miles off the county down coast " they 're pretty much unmistakable - in the male , the dorsal fin can be six or seven feet in height , so there 's very few whales or dolphins you would confuse it with . "
he says that despite their scary name , we have little to fear from the giant mammals .
" they certainly have earned a reputation for being dangerous , partly because they feed on other large mammals such as seals or porpoises , which we do find close to the shore .
" they are also highly intelligent and inquisitive animals .
" unlike whales or dolphins , they wo n't be put off by boat traffic - they will come close .
" they have a perhaps unfair reputation as being dangerous as they are n't easily intimidated . "
bbc northern ireland 's rural affairs correspondent martin cassidy said that there have been no reports of whales attacking swimmers or boats , and indeed , we pose more of a risk to them .
brian meharg had a brush with a killer whale while on a boat trip " fishing gear poses the greatest danger , as they could become ensnared in the fine mesh of fishermen 's nets , " he said .
" pollution can be another problem for them - it comes with the territory of being top of the food chain , as chemicals consumed by their prey all get passed on to the whale .

boat skipper brian meharg is one man who has had a close encounter while on a trip across the north channel to scotland .
" everything was going well , and i was steering the boat at the time when i noticed on my starboard side this massive fin about 100 metres away , " he says .
" it was quite a shock because i 've seen quite a lot in my time - dolphins , porpoises , basking sharks - but this fin was four or five feet out of the water and travelling at quite a speed .
' not peckish ' " it just shot straight past us and on towards the isle of man .
i 'm glad to say it was n't peckish at the time . "
killer whales can be as long as nine metres , but it 's not just their size which can be intimidating .
they have a perhaps unfair reputation as being dangerous as they are n't easily intimidated gary burrows environment and heritage service their movement through the water underlines their superiority of the seas - the distinctive dorsal fin arcs up through the surface and then below again with an awesome power .
gary burrows of the environment and heritage service says they have been spotted all around the irish coast in the past three years .
" they 've been seen in lough foyle , whitepark bay and as recently as four weeks ago off portmuck , " he says .
this killer whale was pictured 10 miles off the county down coast " they 're pretty much unmistakable - in the male , the dorsal fin can be six or seven feet in height , so there 's very few whales or dolphins you would confuse it with . "
he says that despite their scary name , we have little to fear from the giant mammals .
" they certainly have earned a reputation for being dangerous , partly because they feed on other large mammals such as seals or porpoises , which we do find close to the shore .
" they are also highly intelligent and inquisitive animals .
" unlike whales or dolphins , they wo n't be put off by boat traffic - they will come close .
" they have a perhaps unfair reputation as being dangerous as they are n't easily intimidated . "
bbc northern ireland 's rural affairs correspondent martin cassidy said that there have been no reports of whales attacking swimmers or boats , and indeed , we pose more of a risk to them .
brian meharg had a brush with a killer whale while on a boat trip " fishing gear poses the greatest danger , as they could become ensnared in the fine mesh of fishermen 's nets , " he said .
" pollution can be another problem for them - it comes with the territory of being top of the food chain , as chemicals consumed by their prey all get passed on to the whale .
" conservationists are encouraged by the numbers of killer whales now being seen .
" is global warming driving them further north in search of colder waters ?
" it is too early to say , but the irish whale and dolphin group is collating sightings - if you do spot any killer whales this summer you can visit their website , www.iwdg.ie , and get in touch . "

" lilos may be fun in the swimming pool but they are not safe on the sea .
