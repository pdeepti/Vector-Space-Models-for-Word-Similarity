do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .
and his enthusiasm is contagious . why all the frow n s ? it 's been a depressing summer in some ways : dreams of world cup victory were disappointed ; jan ulrich was banned from the tour de france for alleged doping ; bruno the bear is dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have sundry sauces to smother their sausage when barbequing the start of the bundesliga soccer season in august will be a yawner after the world cup and the german eu presidency starting in january is n't exactly something to do cartwheels over .
so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- electronic music festivals stand up against rock revival hard rock may be on the upswing in europe - as the recent victory of a finnish band at the eurovision song contest has shown - but the cool , urban sounds of electronica will be heard at many festivals this summer .
-lrb- may 28 , 2006 -rrb- germans catch the travel bug the travel industry may lose valuable holiday guests to the soccer world cup in june , but experts estimate germans will make up for it after the championship ends .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .

ideas ranged from tightening border controls to stimulating african development . in a statement read to the participants of the immigration conference in the moroccan capital , french president jacques chirac called on monday for african and european nations to tackle mass clandestine immigration , " with respect for human dignity but with firmness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac wants a dignified , but firm solution " at stake are the interests of the men and women who risk the journey " to europe , those of the africans living there legally and that of europeans faced with the challenge of globalization , chirac said . illegal migration required an " energetic fight against trafficking networks " along with " police and legal cooperation to improve border surveillance " and the " proper implementation of readmission agreements , " chirac said . " but first we need to confirm europe 's commitment at africa 's side to a partnership for development , " he said , whether by combating disease pandemics or building water , transport and communications infrastructure . tightening the rules france recently adopted a new immigration law which seeks to encourage more qualified workers and tightens entrance rules for other foreigners , notably for immigrants ' families .
it also eliminates automatic citizenship for illegal immigrants who have lived 10 years in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy believes europe and africa need to work together the law has been attacked as " racist " by african campaigners , and france 's interior minister nicolas sarkozy was greeted with angry protests on a recent trip to western africa . in an interview published monday in the moroccan newspaper le matin , sarkozy said that managing migration was " one of the keys for renewing the relationship between europe and africa . " " how can we restore the confidence of africa 's youth and persuade them that there is a future beyond migration ?
our destinies are tied : africa 's failure today would be europe 's disaster tomorrow , " he warned in the interview . a mass influx bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between morocco and spanish enclave melilla the conference was prompted in particular by the mass influx of african migrants to italy and spain , trafficked across the mediterranean or via the canary islands in sometimes barely seaworthy boats .
in spain 's canary islands , some 9,000 african migrants were intercepted in the first five months of 2006 - with 4,780 in may alone . madrid views the rabat gathering as a major diplomatic success and has been seeking firm commitments from its european and african partners in meeting the challenge . spain launched the idea of the conference jointly with rabat last october after hundreds of sub-saharan african migrants stormed the spanish north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla , leaving 14 people dead . the two-day conference is being co-chaired by the foreign ministers of morocco , spain , senegal , france and finland , the current president of the european union . security and poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by poverty and insecurity the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero waldner , also interviewed in le matin monday , said the conference must look at ways of improving living conditions for africans . " we can not limit our discussion purely to security , " she said .
" we can not ignore the primary causes for the population movements which are poverty and insecurity , " she told the newspaper . spain hopes for a joint action plan that combines security measures with development aid that would persuade would-be migrants , lured by tales of a european eldorado , to build their lives at home instead . recommended security measures include reinforcing frontier controls in countries of origin and improving training and facilities for frontier guards .
some of the economic assistance being considered includes promoting projects in the sectors of agriculture , crafts , tourism and fisheries .
the action plan also foresees strengthening legal and police cooperation in curbing people trafficking . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch government brought down in immigration row friday saw the dutch prime minister tender his government 's resignation to head of state queen beatrix after a controversy centered around a somali-born former member of parliament who lied on her asylum application .

ideas ranged from tightening border controls to stimulating african development . in a statement read to the participants of the immigration conference in the moroccan capital , french president jacques chirac called on monday for african and european nations to tackle mass clandestine immigration , " with respect for human dignity but with firmness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac wants a dignified , but firm solution " at stake are the interests of the men and women who risk the journey " to europe , those of the africans living there legally and that of europeans faced with the challenge of globalization , chirac said . illegal migration required an " energetic fight against trafficking networks " along with " police and legal cooperation to improve border surveillance " and the " proper implementation of readmission agreements , " chirac said . " but first we need to confirm europe 's commitment at africa 's side to a partnership for development , " he said , whether by combating disease pandemics or building water , transport and communications infrastructure . tightening the rules france recently adopted a new immigration law which seeks to encourage more qualified workers and tightens entrance rules for other foreigners , notably for immigrants ' families .
it also eliminates automatic citizenship for illegal immigrants who have lived 10 years in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy believes europe and africa need to work together the law has been attacked as " racist " by african campaigners , and france 's interior minister nicolas sarkozy was greeted with angry protests on a recent trip to western africa . in an interview published monday in the moroccan newspaper le matin , sarkozy said that managing migration was " one of the keys for renewing the relationship between europe and africa . " " how can we restore the confidence of africa 's youth and persuade them that there is a future beyond migration ?
our destinies are tied : africa 's failure today would be europe 's disaster tomorrow , " he warned in the interview . a mass influx bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between morocco and spanish enclave melilla the conference was prompted in particular by the mass influx of african migrants to italy and spain , trafficked across the mediterranean or via the canary islands in sometimes barely seaworthy boats .
in spain 's canary islands , some 9,000 african migrants were intercepted in the first five months of 2006 - with 4,780 in may alone . madrid views the rabat gathering as a major diplomatic success and has been seeking firm commitments from its european and african partners in meeting the challenge . spain launched the idea of the conference jointly with rabat last october after hundreds of sub-saharan african migrants stormed the spanish north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla , leaving 14 people dead . the two-day conference is being co-chaired by the foreign ministers of morocco , spain , senegal , france and finland , the current president of the european union . security and poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by poverty and insecurity the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero waldner , also interviewed in le matin monday , said the conference must look at ways of improving living conditions for africans . " we can not limit our discussion purely to security , " she said .
" we can not ignore the primary causes for the population movements which are poverty and insecurity , " she told the newspaper . spain hopes for a joint action plan that combines security measures with development aid that would persuade would-be migrants , lured by tales of a european eldorado , to build their lives at home instead . recommended security measures include reinforcing frontier controls in countries of origin and improving training and facilities for frontier guards .
some of the economic assistance being considered includes promoting projects in the sectors of agriculture , crafts , tourism and fisheries .
the action plan also foresees strengthening legal and police cooperation in curbing people trafficking . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch government brought down in immigration row friday saw the dutch prime minister tender his government 's resignation to head of state queen beatrix after a controversy centered around a somali-born former member of parliament who lied on her asylum application .

germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- electronic music festivals stand up against rock revival hard rock may be on the upswing in europe - as the recent victory of a finnish band at the eurovision song contest has shown - but the cool , urban sounds of electronica will be heard at many festivals this summer .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries .

they 're counting on putting on an equally well-planned and festive event two years from now . " the bar is very high , but it can even be exceeded , " said mutschler .

it is also hoping the effects are long term . much praise has been heaped upon germany for the precision engineering of its organization and the laid-back hospitality that welcomed millions of foreign spectators during the soccer extravaganza .
politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

ideas ranged from tightening border controls to stimulating african development . in a statement read to the participants of the immigration conference in the moroccan capital , french president jacques chirac called on monday for african and european nations to tackle mass clandestine immigration , " with respect for human dignity but with firmness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac wants a dignified , but firm solution " at stake are the interests of the men and women who risk the journey " to europe , those of the africans living there legally and that of europeans faced with the challenge of globalization , chirac said . illegal migration required an " energetic fight against trafficking networks " along with " police and legal cooperation to improve border surveillance " and the " proper implementation of readmission agreements , " chirac said . " but first we need to confirm europe 's commitment at africa 's side to a partnership for development , " he said , whether by combating disease pandemics or building water , transport and communications infrastructure . tightening the rules france recently adopted a new immigration law which seeks to encourage more qualified workers and tightens entrance rules for other foreigners , notably for immigrants ' families .
it also eliminates automatic citizenship for illegal immigrants who have lived 10 years in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy believes europe and africa need to work together the law has been attacked as " racist " by african campaigners , and france 's interior minister nicolas sarkozy was greeted with angry protests on a recent trip to western africa . in an interview published monday in the moroccan newspaper le matin , sarkozy said that managing migration was " one of the keys for renewing the relationship between europe and africa . " " how can we restore the confidence of africa 's youth and persuade them that there is a future beyond migration ?
our destinies are tied : africa 's failure today would be europe 's disaster tomorrow , " he warned in the interview . a mass influx bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between morocco and spanish enclave melilla the conference was prompted in particular by the mass influx of african migrants to italy and spain , trafficked across the mediterranean or via the canary islands in sometimes barely seaworthy boats .
in spain 's canary islands , some 9,000 african migrants were intercepted in the first five months of 2006 - with 4,780 in may alone . madrid views the rabat gathering as a major diplomatic success and has been seeking firm commitments from its european and african partners in meeting the challenge . spain launched the idea of the conference jointly with rabat last october after hundreds of sub-saharan african migrants stormed the spanish north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla , leaving 14 people dead . the two-day conference is being co-chaired by the foreign ministers of morocco , spain , senegal , france and finland , the current president of the european union . security and poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by poverty and insecurity the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero waldner , also interviewed in le matin monday , said the conference must look at ways of improving living conditions for africans . " we can not limit our discussion purely to security , " she said .
" we can not ignore the primary causes for the population movements which are poverty and insecurity , " she told the newspaper . spain hopes for a joint action plan that combines security measures with development aid that would persuade would-be migrants , lured by tales of a european eldorado , to build their lives at home instead . recommended security measures include reinforcing frontier controls in countries of origin and improving training and facilities for frontier guards .
some of the economic assistance being considered includes promoting projects in the sectors of agriculture , crafts , tourism and fisheries .
the action plan also foresees strengthening legal and police cooperation in curbing people trafficking . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch government brought down in immigration row friday saw the dutch prime minister tender his government 's resignation to head of state queen beatrix after a controversy centered around a somali-born former member of parliament who lied on her asylum application .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .
the meeting is due to close on july 16 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crunch time for cathedral 's heritage status the fate of cologne 's cathedral , a un-protected site since 1996 , will be decided this week .

-lrb- july 11 , 2005 -rrb- cologne cathedral to be spared blight by skyscrapers unesco said friday it was likely to remove cologne cathedral from its list of world heritage in danger because a construction project that would have obscured views of the building looks set to be scaled down or shelved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stem cell researchers are leaving the country to pursue their work german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .
animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .

ideas ranged from tightening border controls to stimulating african development . in a statement read to the participants of the immigration conference in the moroccan capital , french president jacques chirac called on monday for african and european nations to tackle mass clandestine immigration , " with respect for human dignity but with firmness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac wants a dignified , but firm solution " at stake are the interests of the men and women who risk the journey " to europe , those of the africans living there legally and that of europeans faced with the challenge of globalization , chirac said . illegal migration required an " energetic fight against trafficking networks " along with " police and legal cooperation to improve border surveillance " and the " proper implementation of readmission agreements , " chirac said . " but first we need to confirm europe 's commitment at africa 's side to a partnership for development , " he said , whether by combating disease pandemics or building water , transport and communications infrastructure . tightening the rules france recently adopted a new immigration law which seeks to encourage more qualified workers and tightens entrance rules for other foreigners , notably for immigrants ' families .
it also eliminates automatic citizenship for illegal immigrants who have lived 10 years in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy believes europe and africa need to work together the law has been attacked as " racist " by african campaigners , and france 's interior minister nicolas sarkozy was greeted with angry protests on a recent trip to western africa . in an interview published monday in the moroccan newspaper le matin , sarkozy said that managing migration was " one of the keys for renewing the relationship between europe and africa .

it is also hoping the effects are long term . much praise has been heaped upon germany for the precision engineering of its organization and the laid-back hospitality that welcomed millions of foreign spectators during the soccer extravaganza .
politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .

the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stem cell researchers are leaving the country to pursue their work german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .

it is also hoping the effects are long term . much praise has been heaped upon germany for the precision engineering of its organization and the laid-back hospitality that welcomed millions of foreign spectators during the soccer extravaganza .
politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stem cell researchers are leaving the country to pursue their work german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .
animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .
the meeting is due to close on july 16 . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crunch time for cathedral 's heritage status the fate of cologne 's cathedral , a un-protected site since 1996 , will be decided this week .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .

do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .

so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost !

actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .

he was referring to an interview she gave in january before visiting president bush in washington . " we expect the chancellor to discuss guantanamo bay -lrb- during the visit -rrb- just as she has done in interviews , " heil told reporters on monday . " we do n't just want big announcements about closing guantanamo , we want to know concretely when this will happen , " he said . he added that the prison camp in cuba can not be a permanent solution , as terror suspects are being held there without being charged . " obligation to help bush close guantanamo " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners performing prayers at guantanamo claudia roth of the opposition green party agreed with heil .
on monday , roth said that merkel had an obligation to help bush close guantanamo , adding that the country could also accept some of the prisoners .
" germany shoud say it is prepared to take in guantanamo detainees , " roth told the berliner zeitung daily . the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international likewise demanded that merkel be pro-active in discussing guantanamo .

she has not said , however , whether she will discuss the issue during the upcoming visit . instead , merkel pointed to statements president bush made in vienna in late june .
he said then that he wanted to eventually shut the prison and send inmates back to their home countries . last month , bush suffered a major blow when the us supreme court deemed as illegal the military tribunal system set up by his administration to try guantanamo prisoners . roughly 450 foreign terrorism suspects , most of them captured in afghanistan during the us invasion that followed the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us , are being held as enemy combatants at the guantanamo camp in cuba . merkel also said that she is able to discuss problems and controversial issues with the president .
she said she believed that was good for germany , europe and for the us . merkel : " seeing eastern germany helps complete picture of germany " bush is due to arrive in merkel 's constituency , stralsund , in eastern germany late wednesday and will spend thursday meeting with her and others who spent time living behind the iron curtain . merkel said she planned to discuss the iran nuclear conflict , north korea , trade talks and energy policy with bush during his visit . in addition , she said she hoped bush would leave with an impression of how german reunification - which took place during his father 's presidency - affected people in ex-communist eastern germany .

i was just checking out zizou 's t-shirt .
forget about law or medicine .
forget about internet technologies and the stock market .
if you want to be part of the latest , greatest high-profile profession , there 's only one thing left for you to do . every respectable tabloid in the world employs them .
every royal wedding desperately needs them .
and if fifa was just a little smarter about getting rid of the millions it earns by selling video games and other global capitalist accoutrements , every world cup would get one : a professional lip-reader . how else would we know what sweet nothings royal couples whisper into each other 's ears while standing before the altar ?
or what the president of a country says to his dog on return from an important diplomatic mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zizou , the heart-breaker , has passionate and devoted fans ever since french soccer legend zinedine zidane , 34 , floored italian party boy marco materazzi with a headbutt to the chest in the second half of extra time in sunday 's world cup final and was sent off the pitch with a red card - depriving his country of a likely victory - everybody has been preoccupied with a burning question : what did materazzi say to provoke such a violent response ? and ever since that spectacular match , lip-readers around the world have been saying : " we know why . " an expert opinion the british daily the times hired forensic and professional lip-reader jessica rees , whose talents have seen her summoned as an expert witness at criminal trials , to study a tape of sunday 's match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red card for zidane probably decided the outcome of the match the truly fascinating thing about ms. rees is that she offers lip-reading services in several languages .

i was just checking out zizou 's t-shirt .
forget about law or medicine .
forget about internet technologies and the stock market .
if you want to be part of the latest , greatest high-profile profession , there 's only one thing left for you to do . every respectable tabloid in the world employs them .
every royal wedding desperately needs them .
and if fifa was just a little smarter about getting rid of the millions it earns by selling video games and other global capitalist accoutrements , every world cup would get one : a professional lip-reader . how else would we know what sweet nothings royal couples whisper into each other 's ears while standing before the altar ?
or what the president of a country says to his dog on return from an important diplomatic mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zizou , the heart-breaker , has passionate and devoted fans ever since french soccer legend zinedine zidane , 34 , floored italian party boy marco materazzi with a headbutt to the chest in the second half of extra time in sunday 's world cup final and was sent off the pitch with a red card - depriving his country of a likely victory - everybody has been preoccupied with a burning question : what did materazzi say to provoke such a violent response ? and ever since that spectacular match , lip-readers around the world have been saying : " we know why . " an expert opinion the british daily the times hired forensic and professional lip-reader jessica rees , whose talents have seen her summoned as an expert witness at criminal trials , to study a tape of sunday 's match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red card for zidane probably decided the outcome of the match the truly fascinating thing about ms. rees is that she offers lip-reading services in several languages .
she does not necessarily understand italian , russian , arabic or punjabi , but she can apparently create a phonetic transcript out of any foreign language she sees on a video tape .
the transcript is then given to professional translators to be translated into english . this process - which some joyless skeptics would refer to as a way of making money while playing chinese whispers or broken telephone - was used in the analysis of the zidane incident . " after an exhaustive study of the match video , and with the help of an italian translator , rees claimed that materazzi called zidane ' the son of a terrorist whore ' before adding ' so just f * * * off ' for good measure , " the times said . non capisco materazzi denied the insinuations on monday .

economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !

condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .

speaking on behalf of a network of some 100 germany non-governmental organizations called " deine stimme gegen armut " -lrb- your voice against poverty -rrb- , grönemeyer said he wished merkel would demonstrate the same level of engagement she showed in the stands at germany 's world cup matches in the global fight against aids and poverty . political trickery ? the singer also accused the german government of " falsifying its balance sheet " on development aid , because it included debt relief for iraq and nigeria in the amounts calculated for development projects . germany must put an end to such political sleight of hand and keep its promises , grönemeyer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders set ambitious goals to reduce poverty last year at gleneagles in scotland the promises made by germany and the other g8 nations at the last year 's summit in gleneagles , scotland are sizeable .
they include a pledge to increase aid by $ 50 billion -lrb- 39.2 billion euros -rrb- a year by 2010 , 100 percent debt cancellation for 38 of the world 's poorest countries , near universal access to aids drugs and care for aids orphans , and a trade deal that would help african nations to export and earn more of their own resources to fight poverty . for germany alone , the promises mean that the government would have to earmark a billion euros each year for development aid .
the alliance of german ngo 's has said its goal will be to serve as a watchdog , ensuring that the g8 nations make good on their promises . " you have to stick to what you promise , " grönemeyer said on monday .
" we want to see facts .

it is also hoping the effects are long term . much praise has been heaped upon germany for the precision engineering of its organization and the laid-back hospitality that welcomed millions of foreign spectators during the soccer extravaganza .
politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

he was referring to an interview she gave in january before visiting president bush in washington . " we expect the chancellor to discuss guantanamo bay -lrb- during the visit -rrb- just as she has done in interviews , " heil told reporters on monday . " we do n't just want big announcements about closing guantanamo , we want to know concretely when this will happen , " he said . he added that the prison camp in cuba can not be a permanent solution , as terror suspects are being held there without being charged . " obligation to help bush close guantanamo " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners performing prayers at guantanamo claudia roth of the opposition green party agreed with heil .
on monday , roth said that merkel had an obligation to help bush close guantanamo , adding that the country could also accept some of the prisoners .
" germany shoud say it is prepared to take in guantanamo detainees , " roth told the berliner zeitung daily . the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international likewise demanded that merkel be pro-active in discussing guantanamo . " if president bush wants to accuse the prisoners of something , then he should do it in the united states in a proper court , " barbara lochbihler , secretary general of amnesty international germany told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she and bush can disagree and that 's okay merkel said during an interview with rtl television on monday that she had mentioned guantanamo each time she met with bush .
she has not said , however , whether she will discuss the issue during the upcoming visit . instead , merkel pointed to statements president bush made in vienna in late june .
he said then that he wanted to eventually shut the prison and send inmates back to their home countries . last month , bush suffered a major blow when the us supreme court deemed as illegal the military tribunal system set up by his administration to try guantanamo prisoners . roughly 450 foreign terrorism suspects , most of them captured in afghanistan during the us invasion that followed the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us , are being held as enemy combatants at the guantanamo camp in cuba . merkel also said that she is able to discuss problems and controversial issues with the president .
she said she believed that was good for germany , europe and for the us . merkel : " seeing eastern germany helps complete picture of germany " bush is due to arrive in merkel 's constituency , stralsund , in eastern germany late wednesday and will spend thursday meeting with her and others who spent time living behind the iron curtain . merkel said she planned to discuss the iran nuclear conflict , north korea , trade talks and energy policy with bush during his visit . in addition , she said she hoped bush would leave with an impression of how german reunification - which took place during his father 's presidency - affected people in ex-communist eastern germany . " i believe this can help complete the picture of germany , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic relations with a " series of problems " german chancellor angela merkel heads to washington on thursday for her two-day inaugural visit .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .

he was referring to an interview she gave in january before visiting president bush in washington . " we expect the chancellor to discuss guantanamo bay -lrb- during the visit -rrb- just as she has done in interviews , " heil told reporters on monday . " we do n't just want big announcements about closing guantanamo , we want to know concretely when this will happen , " he said . he added that the prison camp in cuba can not be a permanent solution , as terror suspects are being held there without being charged . " obligation to help bush close guantanamo " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners performing prayers at guantanamo claudia roth of the opposition green party agreed with heil .
on monday , roth said that merkel had an obligation to help bush close guantanamo , adding that the country could also accept some of the prisoners .
" germany shoud say it is prepared to take in guantanamo detainees , " roth told the berliner zeitung daily . the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international likewise demanded that merkel be pro-active in discussing guantanamo .

she has not said , however , whether she will discuss the issue during the upcoming visit . instead , merkel pointed to statements president bush made in vienna in late june .
he said then that he wanted to eventually shut the prison and send inmates back to their home countries . last month , bush suffered a major blow when the us supreme court deemed as illegal the military tribunal system set up by his administration to try guantanamo prisoners . roughly 450 foreign terrorism suspects , most of them captured in afghanistan during the us invasion that followed the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us , are being held as enemy combatants at the guantanamo camp in cuba . merkel also said that she is able to discuss problems and controversial issues with the president .
she said she believed that was good for germany , europe and for the us . merkel : " seeing eastern germany helps complete picture of germany " bush is due to arrive in merkel 's constituency , stralsund , in eastern germany late wednesday and will spend thursday meeting with her and others who spent time living behind the iron curtain . merkel said she planned to discuss the iran nuclear conflict , north korea , trade talks and energy policy with bush during his visit . in addition , she said she hoped bush would leave with an impression of how german reunification - which took place during his father 's presidency - affected people in ex-communist eastern germany .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .
unesco argued that four multi-storey buildings being installed across the rhine river could block dramatic views of the cathedral and ruin the skyline . new sites could go on the endangered list the other sites the committee took off the endangered list include hampi in india , djoudj national bird sanctuary in the west african state of senegal and ichkeul national park in tunisia . with the four sites removed from the list , the number of world heritage in danger sites shrank from 34 to 30 , but the numbers could go back up again , an official of the un cultural body said . unesco 's world heritage list , created in 1972 , includes some 812 sites around the world , from the giza pyramids in egypt to the great wall of china . the world heritage commission has been meeting since last week in vilnius , lithuania .

it is also hoping the effects are long term . much praise has been heaped upon germany for the precision engineering of its organization and the laid-back hospitality that welcomed millions of foreign spectators during the soccer extravaganza .
politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .
and his enthusiasm is contagious . why all the frow n s ? it 's been a depressing summer in some ways : dreams of world cup victory were disappointed ; jan ulrich was banned from the tour de france for alleged doping ; bruno the bear is dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have sundry sauces to smother their sausage when barbequing the start of the bundesliga soccer season in august will be a yawner after the world cup and the german eu presidency starting in january is n't exactly something to do cartwheels over .
so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .

do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .
and his enthusiasm is contagious . why all the frow n s ? it 's been a depressing summer in some ways : dreams of world cup victory were disappointed ; jan ulrich was banned from the tour de france for alleged doping ; bruno the bear is dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have sundry sauces to smother their sausage when barbequing the start of the bundesliga soccer season in august will be a yawner after the world cup and the german eu presidency starting in january is n't exactly something to do cartwheels over .
so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler .
-lrb- july 5 , 2006 -rrb- electronic music festivals stand up against rock revival hard rock may be on the upswing in europe - as the recent victory of a finnish band at the eurovision song contest has shown - but the cool , urban sounds of electronica will be heard at many festivals this summer .

the cologne cathedral was one of the sites . unesco 's world heritage commission removed the cologne cathedral from the endangered list after authorities in the western german city scaled down plans to build high-rise buildings near the site and made improvements to the way the area surrounding the cathedral is managed , unesco said in a statement . the famed , 13th-century gothic cathedral , on which construction was begun in 1248 and completed in 1880 , dominates cologne 's skyline .
the un agency named the cathedral a world heritage site in 1996 , but placed it on the endangered list in 2004 .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .
animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary .

i was just checking out zizou 's t-shirt .
forget about law or medicine .
forget about internet technologies and the stock market .
if you want to be part of the latest , greatest high-profile profession , there 's only one thing left for you to do . every respectable tabloid in the world employs them .
every royal wedding desperately needs them .
and if fifa was just a little smarter about getting rid of the millions it earns by selling video games and other global capitalist accoutrements , every world cup would get one : a professional lip-reader . how else would we know what sweet nothings royal couples whisper into each other 's ears while standing before the altar ?
or what the president of a country says to his dog on return from an important diplomatic mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zizou , the heart-breaker , has passionate and devoted fans ever since french soccer legend zinedine zidane , 34 , floored italian party boy marco materazzi with a headbutt to the chest in the second half of extra time in sunday 's world cup final and was sent off the pitch with a red card - depriving his country of a likely victory - everybody has been preoccupied with a burning question : what did materazzi say to provoke such a violent response ? and ever since that spectacular match , lip-readers around the world have been saying : " we know why . " an expert opinion the british daily the times hired forensic and professional lip-reader jessica rees , whose talents have seen her summoned as an expert witness at criminal trials , to study a tape of sunday 's match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red card for zidane probably decided the outcome of the match the truly fascinating thing about ms. rees is that she offers lip-reading services in several languages .
she does not necessarily understand italian , russian , arabic or punjabi , but she can apparently create a phonetic transcript out of any foreign language she sees on a video tape .
the transcript is then given to professional translators to be translated into english . this process - which some joyless skeptics would refer to as a way of making money while playing chinese whispers or broken telephone - was used in the analysis of the zidane incident . " after an exhaustive study of the match video , and with the help of an italian translator , rees claimed that materazzi called zidane ' the son of a terrorist whore ' before adding ' so just f * * * off ' for good measure , " the times said . non capisco materazzi denied the insinuations on monday . " i held his shirt ... for only a few seconds , " materazzi told italian newspaper la gazzetta dello sport . " he turned toward me and scoffed at me , looking at me with super-arrogance , up and down , and said ' if you really want my shirt , you can have it later , " ' the paper quoted materazzi as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : materazzi learned not to touch other players ' t-shirts ever again " i certainly did n't call him a terrorist , " materazzi said .
" i am ignorant ; i do n't even know what an islamic terrorist is . " even though soccer players are usually not known for being the most eloquent and erudite people out there , and even though " terrorist " is a multisyllabic word , it is hard to imagine that anybody who has n't spent the last five years on the dark side of the moon would not have registered the t-word . a matter of interpretation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he moves in high circles : zidane , right , with french president chirac and his wife bernadette but let 's not jump to conclusions .
it is not only possible that materazzi is partially aphasic , but also that british see-all-evil queen jessica rees got it wrong this time .
brazil 's globo television also hired a lip-reader who came to a very different conclusion .
according to the bossa nova version of the story , materazzi had called zidane 's sister lila a " prostitute . " the whole lip-reading mania is severely misguided .
while who said what is a matter of intense curiousity - both in psychological terms and as the stuff that soap operas are made of - it is also completely irrelevant because no verbal insult in this world could justify zidane 's physical response . " you are a virtuoso , a genius of world football , " french president chirac told zidane when he returned home on monday .
" you are also a man of heart , of commitment and of conviction .
that is why france admires you and loves you . " of course , while the french president was showering zidane with florid compliments , he made sure to stand at a respectable distance from him .
nobody touched anybody 's t-shirt at the elysée palace that day . if we get lucky , we 'll see at least one exciting hollywood blockbuster thriller about the new most wanted profession in the word .
from the director of " lost in translation " and producers of " the interpreter , " a new film about the mysterious shapes of words : " the lip reader . "

politicians and business leaders have been hoping that the feel-good sentiment would translate into higher consumer spending in a country not exactly known for its extravagant shopping habits .
still , many analysts warned against expecting any kind of 21st century wirtschaftswunder . " there 's been no economic miracle in connection with the world cup , " said dirk ulbricht of the munich-based economic think-tank ifo . few observers had expected the sporting event to have more than a minimal impact on germany 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . " ca n't keep the entire economy going " axel weber , head of germany 's central bank , the bundesbank , said on tuesday that the current party mood in germany in the wake of the world cup will not be sufficient to give a lasting boost to the euro zone 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soccer and beer mix : oliver kahn , a german goalkeeper , enjoying the brew " a great world cup by itself ca n't keep the entire economy going , " weber said in an interview published in the daily die welt .
besides , he said , " the current feel-good sentiment is a short-term phenomenon .
it wo n't be long before we 'll be talking about the same problems that we 've been trying to solve for years , " weber said . however , " the world cup marks an enormous gain in germany 's image , " economy minister michael glos wrote in a column in the monday edition of the business daily handelsblatt . and that could prove particularly valuable at a time when the german economy , long in the doldrums , has been slowly finding its footing again .
economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !
the retail sector certainly appears to have benefited from the soccer championship , with preliminary figures suggesting that shopkeepers saw additional revenues of two billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- during the month-long world cup . nevertheless , there are two sides to the coin and if sales of television sets , beer or flags have exploded , " people who have bought a flat-screen tv or tickets to a match , are going to have scrimp and save elsewhere , " said roland doehrn of the essen-based economic research institute rwi . sportswear maker adidas may have sold 1.7 million football shirts bearing the german national team 's colors , but the clothing industry as a whole has seen sales dwindle , with football supporters showing no inclination to replenish the rest of their wardrobe , complained the industry federation bte . two-thirds of the way into the competition , only 48 percent of hotels and restaurants said they were satisfied with business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish fans saved money by camping transportation companies did well during the world cup .
according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well . " the world cup was a bust for brothel owners and prostitute dealers , " munich 's director of police , wilhelm schmidbauer , told the ard web site , tagesschau.de.
" the fans were more interested in hanging out at the fan miles and drinking beer than going to prostitutes , " he said . fans were still frisky , though .
condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .
but only half of those jobs will still be needed in a year 's time . look good , feel good nevertheless , foreigners ' perceptions of germany appear to be changing and a new term " teamgeist " -lrb- team spirit -rrb- , which was the name of the tournament 's official football , has taken its place alongside words such as " blitzkrieg " or " schadenfreude " in the ranks of internationally understood germanisms , the financial times deutschland suggested . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people are saying germans have a whole new look " and even if it 's difficult to put a economic figure on this change in image , the economy as a whole will certainly benefit from it , " said minister glos . that could help in luring foreign investors .
in an interview with tageschau.de , eva henkel of " invest in germany , " a government-funded agency that promotes foreign investment in germany , said : " it 's clear that we 've shown how wonderful and diverse germany is . " self-confidence is sexy germany stands to gain as a tourist destination .
according to a poll conducted by the german tourism association dzt of foreign visitors during the tournament , 90 percent of those surveyed said they would recommend the country as a holiday destination . around two million foreign tourists came to germany during the month-long tournament , twice as many as anticipated .
and those visitors spent an estimated 600 million euros -lrb- $ 766 million -rrb- . in addition , germans ' own support of their national team , which finished third in the tournament , has led " germans to gradually believe in themselves again , " said markus kurscheidt , an expert on sport economics at the university of bochum . and that will only help consumer morale , which has been looking up for months , even if the boost would have been the greatest had germany actually won the world cup , kurscheidt said . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german business confidence soars again the ifo business climate index has soared to its highest level in 16 years and some say the world cup has helped boost it .

do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .
and his enthusiasm is contagious . why all the frow n s ? it 's been a depressing summer in some ways : dreams of world cup victory were disappointed ; jan ulrich was banned from the tour de france for alleged doping ; bruno the bear is dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have sundry sauces to smother their sausage when barbequing the start of the bundesliga soccer season in august will be a yawner after the world cup and the german eu presidency starting in january is n't exactly something to do cartwheels over .
so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

he was referring to an interview she gave in january before visiting president bush in washington . " we expect the chancellor to discuss guantanamo bay -lrb- during the visit -rrb- just as she has done in interviews , " heil told reporters on monday . " we do n't just want big announcements about closing guantanamo , we want to know concretely when this will happen , " he said . he added that the prison camp in cuba can not be a permanent solution , as terror suspects are being held there without being charged . " obligation to help bush close guantanamo " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners performing prayers at guantanamo claudia roth of the opposition green party agreed with heil .
on monday , roth said that merkel had an obligation to help bush close guantanamo , adding that the country could also accept some of the prisoners .
" germany shoud say it is prepared to take in guantanamo detainees , " roth told the berliner zeitung daily . the german branch of the human rights organization amnesty international likewise demanded that merkel be pro-active in discussing guantanamo . " if president bush wants to accuse the prisoners of something , then he should do it in the united states in a proper court , " barbara lochbihler , secretary general of amnesty international germany told the berliner zeitung . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she and bush can disagree and that 's okay merkel said during an interview with rtl television on monday that she had mentioned guantanamo each time she met with bush .

she has not said , however , whether she will discuss the issue during the upcoming visit . instead , merkel pointed to statements president bush made in vienna in late june .
he said then that he wanted to eventually shut the prison and send inmates back to their home countries . last month , bush suffered a major blow when the us supreme court deemed as illegal the military tribunal system set up by his administration to try guantanamo prisoners . roughly 450 foreign terrorism suspects , most of them captured in afghanistan during the us invasion that followed the september 11 terrorist attacks in the us , are being held as enemy combatants at the guantanamo camp in cuba . merkel also said that she is able to discuss problems and controversial issues with the president .
she said she believed that was good for germany , europe and for the us . merkel : " seeing eastern germany helps complete picture of germany " bush is due to arrive in merkel 's constituency , stralsund , in eastern germany late wednesday and will spend thursday meeting with her and others who spent time living behind the iron curtain . merkel said she planned to discuss the iran nuclear conflict , north korea , trade talks and energy policy with bush during his visit . in addition , she said she hoped bush would leave with an impression of how german reunification - which took place during his father 's presidency - affected people in ex-communist eastern germany .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stem cell researchers are leaving the country to pursue their work german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .
animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary .
-lrb- may 7 , 2006 -rrb- keeping stem cells cold , very cold doing research using stem cells is controversial .
but even before any research can be carried out , the cells have to be stored at extremely cold temperatures .
that 's exactly what one german institute specializes in .

ideas ranged from tightening border controls to stimulating african development . in a statement read to the participants of the immigration conference in the moroccan capital , french president jacques chirac called on monday for african and european nations to tackle mass clandestine immigration , " with respect for human dignity but with firmness . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac wants a dignified , but firm solution " at stake are the interests of the men and women who risk the journey " to europe , those of the africans living there legally and that of europeans faced with the challenge of globalization , chirac said . illegal migration required an " energetic fight against trafficking networks " along with " police and legal cooperation to improve border surveillance " and the " proper implementation of readmission agreements , " chirac said . " but first we need to confirm europe 's commitment at africa 's side to a partnership for development , " he said , whether by combating disease pandemics or building water , transport and communications infrastructure . tightening the rules france recently adopted a new immigration law which seeks to encourage more qualified workers and tightens entrance rules for other foreigners , notably for immigrants ' families .
it also eliminates automatic citizenship for illegal immigrants who have lived 10 years in the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french interior minister nicolas sarkozy believes europe and africa need to work together the law has been attacked as " racist " by african campaigners , and france 's interior minister nicolas sarkozy was greeted with angry protests on a recent trip to western africa . in an interview published monday in the moroccan newspaper le matin , sarkozy said that managing migration was " one of the keys for renewing the relationship between europe and africa . " " how can we restore the confidence of africa 's youth and persuade them that there is a future beyond migration ?
our destinies are tied : africa 's failure today would be europe 's disaster tomorrow , " he warned in the interview . a mass influx bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the border between morocco and spanish enclave melilla the conference was prompted in particular by the mass influx of african migrants to italy and spain , trafficked across the mediterranean or via the canary islands in sometimes barely seaworthy boats .
in spain 's canary islands , some 9,000 african migrants were intercepted in the first five months of 2006 - with 4,780 in may alone . madrid views the rabat gathering as a major diplomatic success and has been seeking firm commitments from its european and african partners in meeting the challenge . spain launched the idea of the conference jointly with rabat last october after hundreds of sub-saharan african migrants stormed the spanish north african enclaves of ceuta and melilla , leaving 14 people dead . the two-day conference is being co-chaired by the foreign ministers of morocco , spain , senegal , france and finland , the current president of the european union . security and poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is driven mainly by poverty and insecurity the eu commissioner for external relations , benita ferrero waldner , also interviewed in le matin monday , said the conference must look at ways of improving living conditions for africans . " we can not limit our discussion purely to security , " she said .
" we can not ignore the primary causes for the population movements which are poverty and insecurity , " she told the newspaper . spain hopes for a joint action plan that combines security measures with development aid that would persuade would-be migrants , lured by tales of a european eldorado , to build their lives at home instead . recommended security measures include reinforcing frontier controls in countries of origin and improving training and facilities for frontier guards .
some of the economic assistance being considered includes promoting projects in the sectors of agriculture , crafts , tourism and fisheries .
the action plan also foresees strengthening legal and police cooperation in curbing people trafficking . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch government brought down in immigration row friday saw the dutch prime minister tender his government 's resignation to head of state queen beatrix after a controversy centered around a somali-born former member of parliament who lied on her asylum application .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .

i was just checking out zizou 's t-shirt .
forget about law or medicine .
forget about internet technologies and the stock market .
if you want to be part of the latest , greatest high-profile profession , there 's only one thing left for you to do . every respectable tabloid in the world employs them .
every royal wedding desperately needs them .
and if fifa was just a little smarter about getting rid of the millions it earns by selling video games and other global capitalist accoutrements , every world cup would get one : a professional lip-reader . how else would we know what sweet nothings royal couples whisper into each other 's ears while standing before the altar ?
or what the president of a country says to his dog on return from an important diplomatic mission ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zizou , the heart-breaker , has passionate and devoted fans ever since french soccer legend zinedine zidane , 34 , floored italian party boy marco materazzi with a headbutt to the chest in the second half of extra time in sunday 's world cup final and was sent off the pitch with a red card - depriving his country of a likely victory - everybody has been preoccupied with a burning question : what did materazzi say to provoke such a violent response ? and ever since that spectacular match , lip-readers around the world have been saying : " we know why . " an expert opinion the british daily the times hired forensic and professional lip-reader jessica rees , whose talents have seen her summoned as an expert witness at criminal trials , to study a tape of sunday 's match . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red card for zidane probably decided the outcome of the match the truly fascinating thing about ms. rees is that she offers lip-reading services in several languages .
she does not necessarily understand italian , russian , arabic or punjabi , but she can apparently create a phonetic transcript out of any foreign language she sees on a video tape .
the transcript is then given to professional translators to be translated into english . this process - which some joyless skeptics would refer to as a way of making money while playing chinese whispers or broken telephone - was used in the analysis of the zidane incident .

economists hope that the slight uptick of consumer spending will continue to gather momentum . t-shirts , flags and condoms were the hot items at the world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiles , smiles , everyone !

according to german public broadcaster ard , german railways counted 15 million people who used the railways and trams .
the airline lufthansa calculated an increase of 200,000 passengers compared to last year . brothel operators , however , did not fare as well .

condom manufacturers enjoyed higher sales .
andré schmincke , spokesman for durex condoms , told tagesschau.de that his company sold 30 percent more condoms during the world cup than usual .
" apparently , people huddled closer during the soccer matches , " he said . for the labor market , the world cup has also been something of a success , creating around 50,000 jobs , said economy minister glos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german stem cell researchers are leaving the country to pursue their work german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .
what kind of a moral standard is that " ? asked nayernia . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new technology promises more humane testing german researchers want to use new stem cell testing methods to replace hundreds of thousands experiments on animals .
animal welfare activists are pleased , but wary .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited . does a blastocyst - a ball of cells from a fertilized egg that has the potential to become a human being - possess certain legal rights ?
do infertile couples , if they can afford it , have the right to bear their own biological child through in-vitro fertilization ? according to german law , the answer is yes to both questions , and therein lies an inherent contradiction . embryonic stem cell lines , which are cultivated from blastocysts and used for medical research worldwide , come from fertility clinics , which routinely create and destroy them in a testtube .
in the process of treating infertility , many more blastocysts are produced than can be implanted in the womb , so that the excess is eventually discarded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic cells are capable of developing into any type of body cell using discarded embryos if blastocysts are being dumped into the refuse anyway , so the logic goes , why not allow medical science to benefit from them ?
research scientists could then produce embryonic stem cell lines that apparently hold great promise in treating debilitating nerve and brain disorders , such as parkinson 's or alzheimer 's , not to mention juvenile diabetes , strokes , heart disease , and even infertility . unlike adult stem cells taken from the bone marrow , embryonic cells are unique in their ability to differentiate and develop into any type of regenerative body tissue . current law in germany bans the production of stem cell lines from blastocysts outright .
scientists are only allowed access to imported lines , and even then , only those that pre-date 2002 , which were cultivated using mouse feeder cells that carry the risk of viruses being transmitted to humans . furthermore , the extra-territorial reach of the law means that german scientists could face criminal prosecution from collaborating with international partners on projects involving newer lines of embryonic stem cells . push to liberalize embryonic stem cell law the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft -lrb- dfg -rrb- , a foundation that promotes scientific research , is pushing for a change in the law that would put germany in line with the more liberal policies of other european countries . " we want to be able to use those superfluous eggs that are being thrown out .
instead we are stuck with these old , used contaminated stem cell lines that are more than four years old , and not terribly useful .
it 's like using old material to build a new house " , said eva-maria streier , a spokeswoman for dfg , who pointed out that the german law is more restrictive than the one in the united states , where human stem cell research is also a political hot potato . in the us though , in spite of opposition from the christian right , the controversy generally applies to the use of federal funds to support research .
whereas in germany , the issue of embryonic stem cell research has resulted in some strange bedfellows .
leftist greens and conservative christian democrats are parties at two ends of the political spectrum but both vehemently opposed to liberalizing the law . scientists pursue research abroad the impact of such restrictions is that many german scientists intent on pursuing human stem cell research are going abroad . " young people are leaving to pursue careers in england , sweden , even china , india , singapore and the u.s. only 15 years ago we were the forerunners in this field , and now other countries are realizing the fruits of our labor , " lamented jürgen hescheler , a leading stem cell biologist at the university of cologne who is a strong proponent of a unified europe-wide law that strikes a balance between respecting human dignity and giving scientists enough latitude to pursue clinical studies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human applications of research done on mice stem-cell biologists such as karim nayernia , an iranian-born german , who has done pioneering work on producing sperm in infertile mice from a blastocyst , is now pursuing research at newcastle university in england instead . " the vast amount of paperwork and approvals needed to comply with german regulations was overwhelming .
furthermore some of the restrictive laws made no sense " , he said . " it is a double standard to allow fertility clinics to destroy embryos in the process of their work , but not to permit the doomed blastocysts to be used for research purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.07.2006 opinion : keep smiling germany , now that it 's over großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's more to life in germany than soccer this summer has had its depressing moments , but that 's no reason for germans to be down in the dumps .
do n't put those flags away , said president köhler : germany has lots of reasons to celebrate . early this morning i pulled up to a stoplight on my bike next to two workmen in a big white van .
the driver rolled down his window and said one word , urlaubsstimmu n g , which means something like " vacation mood . " if it was meant as a pickup line it was a poor one , but more likely he meant it literally .
and his enthusiasm is contagious . why all the frow n s ? it 's been a depressing summer in some ways : dreams of world cup victory were disappointed ; jan ulrich was banned from the tour de france for alleged doping ; bruno the bear is dead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have sundry sauces to smother their sausage when barbequing the start of the bundesliga soccer season in august will be a yawner after the world cup and the german eu presidency starting in january is n't exactly something to do cartwheels over .
so what else do the germans have to get excited about ? plenty , actually . get away - or n ot first of all , the workman in the white van is definitely on to something .
germans have a minimum of 24 vacation days a year - many have more - and now is the perfect time to use them , whether that means hopping on an inexpensive flight to mallorca , taking a car trip to the north sea or just sipping coffee and reading the newspaper on the balcony every morning until noon . those who spend some of their many free days at home will likely make the most of high temperatures and extra long days -lrb- it does n't get dark until after 10 p.m. -rrb- by doing something really german : barbequing .
the ingredients are easy : sausage , steaks , a baguette , some salad - and lots of curry catsup . va n illa is just the begi n n i n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian ice cream is an integration success story in germany speaking of food : summer has just begun , really , and that means that the ice cream shops will be open for several more months .
ice cream can count as a meal here , and it 's a little known fact that germany has the best in the world .
actually , a lot of german ice cream comes from italy , but we do n't want to talk about that after tuesday 's game . korbach , a town of only 20,000 in central germany , has six -lrb- ! -rrb- ice cream parlors in the city center -lrb- four of which are owned by the same italian family -rrb- , but that 's no anomaly .
it 's not uncommon to find multiple eiscafes on the same block - nor is it a rarity to see every second adult with a cone in their hand on hot days .
in some countries , the creamy dessert is considered kids ' food .
i 'm glad i do n't live there ! come to think of it , maybe the germans ' love of ice cream -lrb- and pizza -rrb- will contribute to the rebuilding of italian-german relations following their crushing last-minute 0-2 loss . more black , red a n d gold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said that patriotism in germany can even help integration two days after germany qualified for the losers ' game , the bild newspaper offered its readers 50 reasons why their country is still the best : forward miroslav klose is this world cup 's top scorer , so many german women -lrb- including the chancellor -rrb- now know what off-sides is , and klinsmann 's eleven made it further than brazil , just to name a few . the list also reminded readers that now germans all know their national anthem by heart and everyone 's got a flag at home .
patriotism in the form of painted faces , german flag bikinis , or black-red-and-gold-striped wigs has n't surprised anyone during this marathon soccer month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oktoberfest is not all that far off - we can raise a glass to that !
however , the national pride that has been worn on every sleeve this month seems to have taken root and the stereotypical national pessimism that germans tend to harbor is the real world cup loser . germans have typically been far more cynical about their own country than others looking in , but there 's never been a better time to change that . even president horst köhler encouraged his countrymen and women in an interview with bild to hang on to the patriotism that has been so conspicuous recently . bye-bye summer blues whether it 's the love parade in july , cheap last-minute plane tickets to a sandy beach in august or oktoberfest in september , germans - and visitors to germany - have plenty to pull them out of the doldrums in the coming months . so , grab a cold german beer , a black-red-and-gold flag - and several scoops of italian ice cream - and say " prost ! " to germany . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : opinion : why it 's good that " we " lost july 4 is unlikely to become a german national holiday after italy thwarted the country 's world cup hopes on tuesday .
but maybe it 's a date worth celebrating once the tears have dried , says dw-world.de 's mathis winkler .

the days when you might pop round to neighbour to borrow a cup of sugar - or even marry the girl next door - are long gone .
these days , nearly six people out of ten do n't even know their neighbours ' names all this week on breakfast , david sillito 's looking at how to build stronger neighbourhood ties .
today , he finds out how traffic has bulldozed our communities - and what can be done : jump straight to our e-mail form to let us know what you think ted dewan is a friendly chap but he discovered recently that he had made someone very angry .
a motorist had crashed his 4 x 4 in to his living room and tried to destroy his sofa .
outrageous ?
well , ted had erected his living room in the street .
it was n't blocking the entire street , but it did n't make driving at speed very easy .
it does n't end there .
self-styled " road witch " ted dewan ted goes out of his way to make driving down beechcroft road in oxford an unpredictable experience .
some days he wheels a giant wooden bunny in to the street , he 's built a fake speed camera , there are socks hanging from a washing line over the road to deter high sided vehicles , all to try to make drivers on this little cut-through slow down and take a bit more care .
his ambition is to make the street a bit more sociable by making it feel less like a typical street which is engineered to allow cars to drive at speed .
more traffic equals fewer friends his view reflects a famous study by the american professor , donald appleyard , who said that residents of streets with light traffic have , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as people on streets with heavy traffic .
ted 's creations are certainly eccentric and for motorists a bit alarming but it reflects a growing movement across the world .
a number of traffic engineers are realising that as they make streets safer by fencing off pedestrians , removing visual obstructions , and straightening out bends , they are actually making them easier to speed along .
the giant bunny slows cars down attempts to make streets safer could actually be making them more dangerous .
the government has begun to experiment with these ideas over recent years .
the home zones project changes the design of the street to give pedestrians greater priority in residential neighbourhoods .
cars have to weave through areas of diagonal parking , pavements and roads are built on the same level , and trees and planters are used to create a more relaxed atmosphere .
five roads , one neighbourhood in ealing in west london there is one of the original home zone pilot projects .
the five roads area has seen a big drop in the amount of through traffic -lrb- especially because the road linking them to the nearby supermarket has been blocked off -rrb- and some residents say they now know many more people in the neighbourhood .
these schemes can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds if not millions .
some residents also resent the way the schemes are designed ; moving or reducing the number of parking places can cause years of resentment .
there is also the matter of where the traffic that once moved through has now gone .
some fear they have simply shifted their problems in to other nearby streets .
others said -lrb- quietly -rrb- that they missed being able to drive quickly around the area , the speed bumps and chicanes were a daily irritant .
and finally , the evidence to see if it has allowed children to be more active and neighbourhoods more sociable is not yet conclusive .
some residents we spoke to said the initial ' coming together ' in the neighbourhood had been caused by the creation of the home zone and that as the years had gone by people had begun to drift off again in to their own private worlds .
but if you happen to be driving around oxford and notice a rather tatty looking speed camera and a large wooden bunny . well , you now know what it 's all about .
tomorrow , we 'll look at how the internet is building new communities and bringing people closer together .

self-styled " road witch " ted dewan ted goes out of his way to make driving down beechcroft road in oxford an unpredictable experience .
some days he wheels a giant wooden bunny in to the street , he 's built a fake speed camera , there are socks hanging from a washing line over the road to deter high sided vehicles , all to try to make drivers on this little cut-through slow down and take a bit more care .
his ambition is to make the street a bit more sociable by making it feel less like a typical street which is engineered to allow cars to drive at speed .
more traffic equals fewer friends his view reflects a famous study by the american professor , donald appleyard , who said that residents of streets with light traffic have , on average , three more friends and twice as many acquaintances as people on streets with heavy traffic .
ted 's creations are certainly eccentric and for motorists a bit alarming but it reflects a growing movement across the world .
a number of traffic engineers are realising that as they make streets safer by fencing off pedestrians , removing visual obstructions , and straightening out bends , they are actually making them easier to speed along .
the giant bunny slows cars down attempts to make streets safer could actually be making them more dangerous .
the government has begun to experiment with these ideas over recent years .
the home zones project changes the design of the street to give pedestrians greater priority in residential neighbourhoods .
cars have to weave through areas of diagonal parking , pavements and roads are built on the same level , and trees and planters are used to create a more relaxed atmosphere .
five roads , one neighbourhood in ealing in west london there is one of the original home zone pilot projects .
the five roads area has seen a big drop in the amount of through traffic -lrb- especially because the road linking them to the nearby supermarket has been blocked off -rrb- and some residents say they now know many more people in the neighbourhood .
these schemes can cost hundreds of thousands of pounds if not millions .
some residents also resent the way the schemes are designed ; moving or reducing the number of parking places can cause years of resentment .
there is also the matter of where the traffic that once moved through has now gone .
some fear they have simply shifted their problems in to other nearby streets .
others said -lrb- quietly -rrb- that they missed being able to drive quickly around the area , the speed bumps and chicanes were a daily irritant .
and finally , the evidence to see if it has allowed children to be more active and neighbourhoods more sociable is not yet conclusive .
some residents we spoke to said the initial ' coming together ' in the neighbourhood had been caused by the creation of the home zone and that as the years had gone by people had begun to drift off again in to their own private worlds .
but if you happen to be driving around oxford and notice a rather tatty looking speed camera and a large wooden bunny . well , you now know what it 's all about .
tomorrow , we 'll look at how the internet is building new communities and bringing people closer together .

howsham corn mill in north yorkshire was built in about 1755 .
the building - now vandalised and roofless - was designed for both practical and ornamental purposes as a workplace and a landmark .
redundant since 1947 , the building has recently become a focus for local people , who are looking to create a community space and educational centre .
standing on an island , the square grade ii corn mill was constructed to use the fast-running water of the river derwent , as well as to provide an attractive landscape feature which could be glimpsed from nearby howsham hall .
viewers will be asked to vote for the mill to be short-listed as a candidate for restoration in the new series of the programme , to be broadcast in the next few weeks .
the intention is that it will be self-financing by generating electricity from its own restored water wheel .

it is hoped the world cup win will give italian football a boost yet a sports tribunal set up by the italian football federation , federcalcio , to investigate what has been described here as the biggest match-fixing scandal ever to besmirch italian soccer , is due to deliver later this week in what could be a devastating verdict for four top italian first division clubs : juventus , ac milan , fiorentina and lazio .
the tribunal is sitting in a sparsely furnished temporary courtroom at rome 's olympic football stadium .
five of the six judges are retired high court judges , the sixth is an official of the referees ' association .
the verdict will then be immediately re-examined by an appeals tribunal .
relegation possible match-fixing allegations have shocked the football-loving nation serious allegations of extensive match-fixing and fraud first surfaced last may with the publication of alleged telephone conversations between officials discussing which referees should take charge of matches played by the current first division champions , turin 's juventus .
the scandal mushroomed into a major enquiry into the ethical conduct of the entire football industry .
now the four clubs , including juventus , stand to be relegated to minor divisions of the italian league and / or be stripped of their former championship titles .
six members of italy 's cup winning team have played or are currently playing for juventus .

the clubs could also be thrown out of european competitions .

the federation hopes the world cup win will prove a turning point earlier in the month , about 20,000 juventus fans staged a march through the streets of turin in support of their city 's club , long associated with the agnelli family , founders and major shareholders in the fiat motor company .
the newly-appointed club chairman said juventus may have committed sins but they were minor ones , not major ones .
from berlin , the newly-appointed special commissioner of italy 's football federation guido rossi has made comforting noises saying that italy 's world cup victory lays the basis for a new renaissance of italian football .
" now we have to separate the negative side from the positive , " he added .
also present in berlin was stefano palazzi , the prosecutor who last week asked the tribunal to impose severe sanctions against clubs and officials accused in the match fixing scandal .
the italian federation has a 27 july deadline to communicate to uefa the names of seven italian clubs which will take part in the coming season 's european championships .
relegation would mean that some at least of italy 's new football heroes might be ineligible to take part .

english heritage 's original application was refused by salisbury district council amid fears a rail link would damage the environment .
but after an appeal , planners on monday approved the scheme with conditions .
the development can not start until the government has sanctioned improvements to the nearby a303 , including a tunnel through the wiltshire countryside .
world heritage site councillor mike hewitt said the plans had met with some opposition .
" none of us like the application 100 % , but it is the best we have got at the moment , " he said .
" the current visitor centre is not a good advertisement for the uk .
it is cramped and there is nowhere to shelter from the rain .

from 11 july , microsoft will no longer help users over the phone with any problems they have with the ageing operating system .
the firm will also stop providing security updates for windows 98 from the same date .
support for the software was originally due to end in 2003 , but was extended following customer protests .
shutting down products affected by closing down the support system include windows 98 , windows 98 second edition , and windows me -lrb- millennium edition -rrb- .
analyst firm idc believes that more than 70 million users will be hit by the change .
the majority of these people are likely to be using the operating system at home , as by now most large businesses have phased out machines running the software .
many small firms are also believed to be users of the product .
microsoft ended free support for this trio of products in late 2003 but continued to offer paid support and provide critical security updates .
this too will now stop .
vote results do you still use windows 98 ?
yes 37.45 % no 62.55 % 8728 votes cast results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion the change means that those still using windows 98 and me after 11 july could become more vulnerable to many security risks , as bug fixes for loopholes exploited by hackers will no longer become available .
in a statement microsoft said it was " ending support for these products because they are outdated and these older operating systems can expose customers to security risks " .
mikko hypponen from finnish security firm f-secure said that it was still providing updates for windows 98 users who run its anti-virus package .
" in fact , 98 users are not at that great a risk as people might think : most of the new malware we see simply wo n't run there , " he said .
" nevertheless , if you want to be safe with 98 : do n't go online .
or upgrade to something that is supported with security patches , " he added .
have your say unfortunately , it 's the nature of the industry and windows 98 has had its day simon neale send us your comments according to computer security firm secure science , at least one hi-tech crime gang based in eastern europe specialises in windows 98 and produces viruses that prey on the software 's weaknesses .
this is because users of it tend to have little knowledge of potential dangers - and are older , so are more likely to have substantial financial assets worth stealing .
the launch of windows 98 was a big event users of windows 98 who have problems with the software may find an answer to their query themselves by hunting through the support information collected on the microsoft website .
the software giant said this data will be kept live until " at least 11 july 2007 " .
it urged users to upgrade to a more secure operating system , such as windows xp , as soon as possible .
this could mean buying a new pc for those running a machine bought eight years ago with windows 98 pre-installed .
this is because the hardware specifications for windows 98 fall far short of the minimum required to run windows xp .
it may also mean they have to replace or update any peripherals they use with that ageing machine .
the turn off for windows 98 was originally due to fall in late 2003 .
however , protests from many developing regions of the world where , at that time , the software was widely used prompted microsoft to reverse its decision .

microsoft ended free support for this trio of products in late 2003 but continued to offer paid support and provide critical security updates .
this too will now stop .

yes 37.45 % no 62.55 % 8728 votes cast results are indicative and may not reflect public opinion the change means that those still using windows 98 and me after 11 july could become more vulnerable to many security risks , as bug fixes for loopholes exploited by hackers will no longer become available .

what was it like to use a computer back in 1998 ?
visionary science fiction writer william gibson once wrote : " the future is here .
it 's just not widely distributed yet " .
by that he meant that technologies which re-make our lives tend to appear in small patches before they spread , connect and engulf everyone in a tidal wave of change .
the flipside of his observation is that the past has not entirely departed either .
there are places where it stubbornly persists .
visiting these places gives us a chance to see if predictions about how technology and the world would interact , came true .
time travel a perfect opportunity to visit the past and check our visions of the future has arisen with microsoft 's decision to end support for windows 98 .
by re-installing it on an old pc we can see what the future looked like eight years ago and check our progress .
for this time travelling i used an old gateway pc that has a piii 450 intel chip onboard , 384mb ram and a four gigabyte hard drive .
installing windows 98 was straight-forward and hints of the changes it brought in were evident from the start .
one of the splash screens that popped up while the software was installing said : " with windows 98 you can connect to the internet quickly and easily " , another started : " if you have internet access ... " .
both point up the fact that in 1998 , consumers were only just starting to go online in big numbers .
it was when the dotcom boom was just starting to be heard .
at that time about 36 million web hosts were registered - today there are almost 400 million of them .
although it was possible to use the net with windows 95 , it was in windows 98 that microsoft started to tie the operating system much more closely to its internet explorer browser .
with windows 98 it became possible to view directories as a web page and to navigate between locations using the same keys as you do to go back and forth when browsing the net .
net gains despite microsoft 's claims that windows 98 makes using the net easier , finding a browser that worked with the raw operating system was a challenge .
have your say " unfortunately , it 's the nature of the industry and windows 98 has had its day " simon neale send us your comments internet explorer 4.0 is now obsolete and it proved impossible to download a newer version of the browser from the microsoft site using the old software .
the only browser i could get working straight off was opera - once i had that working updating other components got easier .
but most striking about the windows 98 desktop on a fresh installation was the large floating bar down the right-hand side that brought together links to more than 35 so-called " channels " through which relevant net content was supposed to be piped .
some channels were run by companies such as disney , warner brothers and aol but others were arranged around categories such as news and entertainment .
the idea was that the channel partners would prepare special content that would be " pushed " out to users .
prominent among the list of channel partners is pointcast - one of the bright stars of the early dotcom days but which shut down its " push " system in 1999 due to lack of interest .
clicking on the channels opened up a full screen where the content would be aired .
at the time it was thought that the net was going to become more like tv and viewers / users would tune in to those channels of interest .
now , eight years on , none of the channels are active .
at best clicking on the links to channel partners re-directs to the homepage of the company involved - such as forbes , or zdnet .
at worst clicking crashed the browser .
this vision of content " pushed " to users is one that has not been fulfilled - at least not entirely .
" push " has some parallels with rss with one big difference .
rss is all about you choosing what you want to see rather than have it " pushed " to you whether you want it or not .
and perhaps this reveals the big difference between the visions of 1998 and the reality of today .
back then big players thought they would be in control of the net and dispense it to users .
but now its real power is being revealed in the communities it brings together and the information it gives them so they can make better choices .

what was it like to use a computer back in 1998 ?
visionary science fiction writer william gibson once wrote : " the future is here .
it 's just not widely distributed yet " .
by that he meant that technologies which re-make our lives tend to appear in small patches before they spread , connect and engulf everyone in a tidal wave of change .
the flipside of his observation is that the past has not entirely departed either .
there are places where it stubbornly persists .
visiting these places gives us a chance to see if predictions about how technology and the world would interact , came true .
time travel a perfect opportunity to visit the past and check our visions of the future has arisen with microsoft 's decision to end support for windows 98 .
by re-installing it on an old pc we can see what the future looked like eight years ago and check our progress .
for this time travelling i used an old gateway pc that has a piii 450 intel chip onboard , 384mb ram and a four gigabyte hard drive .
installing windows 98 was straight-forward and hints of the changes it brought in were evident from the start .
launched in 1997 , ie 4.0 is now obsolete one of the splash screens that popped up while the software was installing said : " with windows 98 you can connect to the internet quickly and easily " , another started : " if you have internet access ... " .
both point up the fact that in 1998 , consumers were only just starting to go online in big numbers .
it was when the dotcom boom was just starting to be heard .
at that time about 36 million web hosts were registered - today there are almost 400 million of them .
although it was possible to use the net with windows 95 , it was in windows 98 that microsoft started to tie the operating system much more closely to its internet explorer browser .
with windows 98 it became possible to view directories as a web page and to navigate between locations using the same keys as you do to go back and forth when browsing the net .
net gains despite microsoft 's claims that windows 98 makes using the net easier , finding a browser that worked with the raw operating system was a challenge .
have your say unfortunately , it 's the nature of the industry and windows 98 has had its day simon neale send us your comments internet explorer 4.0 is now obsolete and it proved impossible to download a newer version of the browser from the microsoft site using the old software .
the only browser i could get working straight off was opera - once i had that working updating other components got easier .
but most striking about the windows 98 desktop on a fresh installation was the large floating bar down the right-hand side that brought together links to more than 35 so-called " channels " through which relevant net content was supposed to be piped .
when windows 98 launched , most net users were on dial-up some channels were run by companies such as disney , warner brothers and aol but others were arranged around categories such as news and entertainment .
the idea was that the channel partners would prepare special content that would be " pushed " out to users .
prominent among the list of channel partners is pointcast - one of the bright stars of the early dotcom days but which shut down its " push " system in 1999 due to lack of interest .
clicking on the channels opened up a full screen where the content would be aired .
at the time it was thought that the net was going to become more like tv and viewers / users would tune in to those channels of interest .
now , eight years on , none of the channels are active .
at best clicking on the links to channel partners re-directs to the homepage of the company involved - such as forbes , or zdnet .
at worst clicking crashed the browser .
this vision of content " pushed " to users is one that has not been fulfilled - at least not entirely .
" push " has some parallels with rss with one big difference .
rss is all about you choosing what you want to see rather than have it " pushed " to you whether you want it or not .
and perhaps this reveals the big difference between the visions of 1998 and the reality of today .
back then big players thought they would be in control of the net and dispense it to users .
but now its real power is being revealed in the communities it brings together and the information it gives them so they can make better choices .
and it is william gibson that gives an insight into why this might be .
" the street , " he has written , " finds its own uses for things . "

what was it like to use a computer back in 1998 ?
visionary science fiction writer william gibson once wrote : " the future is here .
it 's just not widely distributed yet " .
by that he meant that technologies which re-make our lives tend to appear in small patches before they spread , connect and engulf everyone in a tidal wave of change .
the flipside of his observation is that the past has not entirely departed either .
there are places where it stubbornly persists .
visiting these places gives us a chance to see if predictions about how technology and the world would interact , came true .
time travel a perfect opportunity to visit the past and check our visions of the future has arisen with microsoft 's decision to end support for windows 98 .
by re-installing it on an old pc we can see what the future looked like eight years ago and check our progress .
for this time travelling i used an old gateway pc that has a piii 450 intel chip onboard , 384mb ram and a four gigabyte hard drive .
installing windows 98 was straight-forward and hints of the changes it brought in were evident from the start .
launched in 1997 , ie 4.0 is now obsolete one of the splash screens that popped up while the software was installing said : " with windows 98 you can connect to the internet quickly and easily " , another started : " if you have internet access ... " .
both point up the fact that in 1998 , consumers were only just starting to go online in big numbers .
it was when the dotcom boom was just starting to be heard .
at that time about 36 million web hosts were registered - today there are almost 400 million of them .
although it was possible to use the net with windows 95 , it was in windows 98 that microsoft started to tie the operating system much more closely to its internet explorer browser .
with windows 98 it became possible to view directories as a web page and to navigate between locations using the same keys as you do to go back and forth when browsing the net .
net gains despite microsoft 's claims that windows 98 makes using the net easier , finding a browser that worked with the raw operating system was a challenge .
have your say unfortunately , it 's the nature of the industry and windows 98 has had its day simon neale send us your comments internet explorer 4.0 is now obsolete and it proved impossible to download a newer version of the browser from the microsoft site using the old software .
the only browser i could get working straight off was opera - once i had that working updating other components got easier .
but most striking about the windows 98 desktop on a fresh installation was the large floating bar down the right-hand side that brought together links to more than 35 so-called " channels " through which relevant net content was supposed to be piped .
when windows 98 launched , most net users were on dial-up some channels were run by companies such as disney , warner brothers and aol but others were arranged around categories such as news and entertainment .
the idea was that the channel partners would prepare special content that would be " pushed " out to users .
prominent among the list of channel partners is pointcast - one of the bright stars of the early dotcom days but which shut down its " push " system in 1999 due to lack of interest .
clicking on the channels opened up a full screen where the content would be aired .
at the time it was thought that the net was going to become more like tv and viewers / users would tune in to those channels of interest .
now , eight years on , none of the channels are active .
at best clicking on the links to channel partners re-directs to the homepage of the company involved - such as forbes , or zdnet .
at worst clicking crashed the browser .
this vision of content " pushed " to users is one that has not been fulfilled - at least not entirely .
" push " has some parallels with rss with one big difference .
rss is all about you choosing what you want to see rather than have it " pushed " to you whether you want it or not .

prominent among the list of channel partners is pointcast - one of the bright stars of the early dotcom days but which shut down its " push " system in 1999 due to lack of interest .
clicking on the channels opened up a full screen where the content would be aired .
at the time it was thought that the net was going to become more like tv and viewers / users would tune in to those channels of interest .
now , eight years on , none of the channels are active .
at best clicking on the links to channel partners re-directs to the homepage of the company involved - such as forbes , or zdnet .
at worst clicking crashed the browser .
this vision of content " pushed " to users is one that has not been fulfilled - at least not entirely .
" push " has some parallels with rss with one big difference .
rss is all about you choosing what you want to see rather than have it " pushed " to you whether you want it or not .
and perhaps this reveals the big difference between the visions of 1998 and the reality of today .
back then big players thought they would be in control of the net and dispense it to users .
but now its real power is being revealed in the communities it brings together and the information it gives them so they can make better choices .
and it is william gibson that gives an insight into why this might be .
" the street , " he has written , " finds its own uses for things . "

the ss nomadic , a rusting relic so nearly sent to the scrapyard , is ready to come home .
the nomadic is to return to belfast weeds grow on its deck , and year after year of recent neglect have taken a heavy toll .
step onboard and you see the enormity of the renovation task .
look hard enough , however , and you do glimpse the potential .
the question is will the millions needed be raised to do the job ?
the british government , who bought the ss nomadic at auction for £ 170,000 in january , has established a trust to raise up to £ 7m to fully restore the vessel and in the process provide a major boost to tourism in belfast .
but if the money is not raised within 18 months , it has threatened to sell the boat for scrap .
that the ss nomadic is still afloat after almost a century is in itself remarkable .
it was built by harland and wolff in belfast for the famous white star line and was used to take first and second class passengers out to titanic at cherbourg in 1912 .
the titanic entered legend when it sank with the loss of more than 1,500 people on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york , but the nomadic 's story continued .
it did service as a troop carrier in both world wars and saw out the end of the century as a floating restaurant beside the eiffel tower in paris before being sent for storage in le havre .
the nomadic no longer has an upper deck or funnel the french titanic society is glad the ss nomadic has a future to look forward to in belfast .
but thierry dufournaud said : " people in belfast need to realise what a big job the renovation will be . "
one of the biggest tasks is replacing the boat 's upper passenger deck and funnel , removed when it left paris .
only some of structure is stored on board , scattered here and there below deck .
the ss nomadic does retain some of its original features like internal doors and decorative ironwork around portholes .
the amount of dark wood is also striking , not just on wall panels but as beams on ceilings .
other artefacts , such as a lifeboat , are in storage but huge sections - like the restaurant area - have been modernised without sympathy .
such is the vessel 's condition that a specialist company has been hired to carry it home on the back of a barge , a journey that begins on tuesday .
jonathan bawden of anchor marine transportation limited said : " we have done this kind of work before but it is great to be involved in nomadic which is part of belfast 's history . "
the homecoming will take a week .
the refurbishment will last years .
bbc newsline will have a specially extended programme on monday 17 july for live coverage of the ship 's return to belfast docks .

the ss nomadic , a rusting relic so nearly sent to the scrapyard , is ready to come home .
the nomadic is to return to belfast weeds grow on its deck , and year after year of recent neglect have taken a heavy toll .
step onboard and you see the enormity of the renovation task .
look hard enough , however , and you do glimpse the potential .
the question is will the millions needed be raised to do the job ?
the british government , who bought the ss nomadic at auction for £ 170,000 in january , has established a trust to raise up to £ 7m to fully restore the vessel and in the process provide a major boost to tourism in belfast .
but if the money is not raised within 18 months , it has threatened to sell the boat for scrap .
that the ss nomadic is still afloat after almost a century is in itself remarkable .
it was built by harland and wolff in belfast for the famous white star line and was used to take first and second class passengers out to titanic at cherbourg in 1912 .
the titanic entered legend when it sank with the loss of more than 1,500 people on its maiden voyage from southampton to new york , but the nomadic 's story continued .
it did service as a troop carrier in both world wars and saw out the end of the century as a floating restaurant beside the eiffel tower in paris before being sent for storage in le havre .
the nomadic no longer has an upper deck or funnel the french titanic society is glad the ss nomadic has a future to look forward to in belfast .
but thierry dufournaud said : " people in belfast need to realise what a big job the renovation will be . "
one of the biggest tasks is replacing the boat 's upper passenger deck and funnel , removed when it left paris .
only some of structure is stored on board , scattered here and there below deck .
the ss nomadic does retain some of its original features like internal doors and decorative ironwork around portholes .
the amount of dark wood is also striking , not just on wall panels but as beams on ceilings .
other artefacts , such as a lifeboat , are in storage but huge sections - like the restaurant area - have been modernised without sympathy .
such is the vessel 's condition that a specialist company has been hired to carry it home on the back of a barge , a journey that begins on tuesday .
jonathan bawden of anchor marine transportation limited said : " we have done this kind of work before but it is great to be involved in nomadic which is part of belfast 's history . "
the homecoming will take a week .
the refurbishment will last years .
bbc newsline will have a specially extended programme on monday 17 july for live coverage of the ship 's return to belfast docks .

the company added that it would be recruiting an extra 4,000 staff to meet demand and help expand its food chain .
like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new stores - were up 8.2 % on last year in the 13 weeks to 1 july .
" we are confident that we can continue to drive the business profitably , " said m & s chief executive stuart rose .
overall sales were up by 10.4 % , with food sales increasing by 9.2 % and general merchandise rising 11.7 % .
mr rose added that while the firm 's performance was encouraging , the growth came against " soft " comparative sales figures from a year ago .
" we ca n't expect the same figures for the second quarter , " said mr rose in a conference call .
the retailer said that the inclusion of easter in the first quarter had increased general merchandise and food sales by about 0.8 % .
mr rose said he would not yet call the latest figures confirmation of a full recovery , and that he would wait until christmas to assess whether the recovery plan had succeeded .
expansion m & s is two years into a three-year recovery scheme .
in may , the retailer reported a 47 % increase in annual profits to £ 745.7m -lrb- $ 1.41bn -rrb- for the year to 1 april . "
the next test will be the store refurbishment programme , but at the moment the market 's relationship with m & s remains heady " richard hunter , hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers in its trading update , m & s said that it would be creating 4,000 new jobs in its stores and it had already begun recruiting , with new staff expected to start in august .
a key reason for the new staff is the growing number of its simply food stores , following its acquisition of 28 outlets from retailer iceland for £ 38m announced in january .
" the next test will be the store refurbishment programme , but at the moment the market 's relationship with m & s remains heady , " said richard hunter of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
mr rose reiterated that despite the latest figures it was " very tough out there " and that " competition had not let up " .
he highlighted that pressure was coming from discount stores , such as primark , as well as the supermarkets .
however , he reiterated that the selling point for m & s was its quality .
in wider terms , higher costs in fuel , rates and rent were all ongoing concerns , mr rose said .
