conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

gazeta wyborcza speculated that marcinkiewicz 's departure " could cause economic turbulence in poland " , and financial analysts concurred .

conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures interviews the stars have their say world cup stars talk to dw-world.de about the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 08.07.2006 world cup final : france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 team hopes to emulate the achievements of the 1998 vintage profiles of the possible starting line-up for the france team for the 2006 world cup final against italy in berlin . fabien barthez position : goalkeeper club : marseille age : 35 caps : 86 flamboyant goalkeeper who has been loved and loathed by french fans throughout a colorful career , which included key roles in the 1998 world cup and euro 2000 victories .
a controversial choice as no.1 keeper ahead of gregory coupet , barthez has looked vulnerable to shots from distance . eric abidal position : fullback club : lyon age : 26 caps : 13 a pacy fullback who likes to get forward in attack , abidal has been a key figure in the lyon side which clinched its fifth successive french championship this season .
back to full fitness after suffering a foot injury late last year , abidal has become a favorite of coach raymond domenech since his debut in 2004 . william gallas position : centre-half club : chelsea age : 26 caps : 46 has been a revelation for france after being given an extended run in his preferred position at the heart of the defense .
skilful on the ball and strong in the tackle , gallas has shown the sort of form which have made him such an invaluable member of chelsea 's english premiership-winning side . lilian thuram position : centre-half club : juventus age : 34 caps : 120 the most capped player in french history , thuram returned to international duty last year after retiring following les bleus dreadful euro 2004 campaign .
has repaid domenech 's faith with some defensive displays that have been right out of the top draw .
man-of-the-match in semi-final win over portugal . willy sagnol position : fullback club : bayern munich age : 29 caps : 44 a long-term understudy to the now retired bixente lizarazu , sagnol was a vocal critic of his treatment by successive french coaches but has now blossomed under domenech .
a skilful defender who started his career as a striker , sagnol is adept at turning defense into attack . claude makelele position : midfield club : chelsea : age : 33 caps : 49 another one of france 's golden oldies who came out of retirement to help the squad qualify for the world cup .
makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .
struggled with a groin injury last season but has played himself back into form at the world cup with two man-of-the-match performances and two goals . florent malouda position : midfield club : lyon age : 26 caps : 18 one of a new generation of french players that domenech has integrated into the old guard , malouda is an elusive winger capable of troubling the meanest defenses with his ability to dribble at pace .
a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .
a dynamic , jack-in-the-box kind of winger , ribery contributed an important goal in the second round win over spain and is a key member of the starting line-up . zinedine zidane position : midfield club : real madrid age : 34 caps : 107 quite simply the finest player of his generation .
the inspiration behind every significant french victory over the past decade , zidane will retire from football after the world cup final .
wonderful ball control , superb vision and a lethal finisher : zidane is the complete footballer . thierry henry position : striker club : arsenal age : 28 caps : 84 has never quite managed to reproduce at international level the mesmerizing form he displays for his club , but henry is without question one of the top three or four players in the world .
has been forced to operate in an unfamiliar lone striker role at the world cup but has still scored three times . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures interviews the stars have their say world cup stars talk to dw-world.de about the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .
this could be , poppe said , something like the question of how islam and christianity approach theater .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 08.07.2006 world cup final : france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 team hopes to emulate the achievements of the 1998 vintage profiles of the possible starting line-up for the france team for the 2006 world cup final against italy in berlin . fabien barthez position : goalkeeper club : marseille age : 35 caps : 86 flamboyant goalkeeper who has been loved and loathed by french fans throughout a colorful career , which included key roles in the 1998 world cup and euro 2000 victories .
a controversial choice as no.1 keeper ahead of gregory coupet , barthez has looked vulnerable to shots from distance . eric abidal position : fullback club : lyon age : 26 caps : 13 a pacy fullback who likes to get forward in attack , abidal has been a key figure in the lyon side which clinched its fifth successive french championship this season .
back to full fitness after suffering a foot injury late last year , abidal has become a favorite of coach raymond domenech since his debut in 2004 . william gallas position : centre-half club : chelsea age : 26 caps : 46 has been a revelation for france after being given an extended run in his preferred position at the heart of the defense .
skilful on the ball and strong in the tackle , gallas has shown the sort of form which have made him such an invaluable member of chelsea 's english premiership-winning side . lilian thuram position : centre-half club : juventus age : 34 caps : 120 the most capped player in french history , thuram returned to international duty last year after retiring following les bleus dreadful euro 2004 campaign .
has repaid domenech 's faith with some defensive displays that have been right out of the top draw .
man-of-the-match in semi-final win over portugal . willy sagnol position : fullback club : bayern munich age : 29 caps : 44 a long-term understudy to the now retired bixente lizarazu , sagnol was a vocal critic of his treatment by successive french coaches but has now blossomed under domenech .
a skilful defender who started his career as a striker , sagnol is adept at turning defense into attack . claude makelele position : midfield club : chelsea : age : 33 caps : 49 another one of france 's golden oldies who came out of retirement to help the squad qualify for the world cup .
makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .
struggled with a groin injury last season but has played himself back into form at the world cup with two man-of-the-match performances and two goals . florent malouda position : midfield club : lyon age : 26 caps : 18 one of a new generation of french players that domenech has integrated into the old guard , malouda is an elusive winger capable of troubling the meanest defenses with his ability to dribble at pace .
a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .
a dynamic , jack-in-the-box kind of winger , ribery contributed an important goal in the second round win over spain and is a key member of the starting line-up . zinedine zidane position : midfield club : real madrid age : 34 caps : 107 quite simply the finest player of his generation .
the inspiration behind every significant french victory over the past decade , zidane will retire from football after the world cup final .
wonderful ball control , superb vision and a lethal finisher : zidane is the complete footballer . thierry henry position : striker club : arsenal age : 28 caps : 84 has never quite managed to reproduce at international level the mesmerizing form he displays for his club , but henry is without question one of the top three or four players in the world .
has been forced to operate in an unfamiliar lone striker role at the world cup but has still scored three times . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup . " katrin jäger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting germany 's language melting pot since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .

too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

jürgen klinsmann will need to dig deep into this bag of motivational tricks to get his downcast germany team up and ready for the third place play-off game against portugal in stuttgart on saturday . klinsmann , still considering his own future after tuesday 's bitter last gasp defeat to italy in the semi-final , will try and eliminate any thoughts that this last game of the hosts ' world cup is a lame duck match and that taking bronze is an achievement worth striving for . traditionally , the third place match is a lethargic affair played out by two emotionally shattered teams who would much rather have their feet up at home enjoying that last days of their summer break while wallowing in what could have been . while germany 's opponents portugal will be downcast after failing to reach their first ever world cup final after losing to a marginally better france team by a single penalty , the home team will have a particularly hard job to lift themselves due to the manner of their own elimination and the effect it had on the entire nation . portugal 's expectations may have been surpassed by making the last four for the first time since 1966 .
but germany 's were crushed despite klinsmann 's own admission that the semi-final was the target for his team . however , as professionals competing for a final position in the tournament in front of their own raucous and intensely proud support , klinsmann 's job of lifting his traumatized players will surely be made easier . " we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate .

germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .

hitler ordered the old venue to be demolished and commissioned a new design by werner march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympiastadion in 1936 despite constant concerns that construction was behind schedule , the stadium and surrounding complex was ready in time for the opening ceremony on aug .
1 , 1936 . hitler ordered a halt to any anti-semitic attacks during the games , so that they would appear to the outside world as a celebration of peace . owens took gold in the 100 meters , 200m , long jump and 4x100m relay , and recalled in his autobiography that he had waved in greeting to hitler , who he said returned the gesture . during world war ii , a bunker was prepared under the stadium to house the nazis ' radio network . somehow , the stadium survived the intense bombing of berlin practically intact .
once germany surrendered , it acted as a headquarters for british troops . efforts were made to erase stadium 's nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated stadium was reopened in july 2004 its name was changed from the reichssportfeld to olympiastadion and it was gradually ' de-nazified ' - emblems of the regime were removed . in 1974 , the stadium was partially roofed to host three matches as west germany staged the world cup , but it had a peripheral role in the tournament and the final was played in munich . the renovated stadium now occupies a central role in the german sports and cultural calendar : it is home to bundesliga club hertha berlin , is used for the german cup final and after the world cup final it will host concerts given by the rolling stones and robbie williams . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

hitler ordered the old venue to be demolished and commissioned a new design by werner march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympiastadion in 1936 despite constant concerns that construction was behind schedule , the stadium and surrounding complex was ready in time for the opening ceremony on aug .
1 , 1936 . hitler ordered a halt to any anti-semitic attacks during the games , so that they would appear to the outside world as a celebration of peace . owens took gold in the 100 meters , 200m , long jump and 4x100m relay , and recalled in his autobiography that he had waved in greeting to hitler , who he said returned the gesture . during world war ii , a bunker was prepared under the stadium to house the nazis ' radio network . somehow , the stadium survived the intense bombing of berlin practically intact .
once germany surrendered , it acted as a headquarters for british troops . efforts were made to erase stadium 's nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated stadium was reopened in july 2004 its name was changed from the reichssportfeld to olympiastadion and it was gradually ' de-nazified ' - emblems of the regime were removed . in 1974 , the stadium was partially roofed to host three matches as west germany staged the world cup , but it had a peripheral role in the tournament and the final was played in munich . the renovated stadium now occupies a central role in the german sports and cultural calendar : it is home to bundesliga club hertha berlin , is used for the german cup final and after the world cup final it will host concerts given by the rolling stones and robbie williams . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .

the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .

" in front of reporters in parliament , the regions party and the communists signed a coalition agreement with the socialists , who in a surprise move had defected from the pro-western " orange " camp the previous day .
the coalition said it was open to other parties . " we 're not closing the doors , " said viktor yanukovych , the leader of regions .
" they are open for other parties or groups of deputies . " the trio , which controls 240 seats in the 450-member upper rada legislature , said it would nominate as its prime minister yanukovych , who lost the bitterly-contested " orange revolution " election contest to president viktor yushchenko in late 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster of yanukovych the coalition said it would forward yanukovych 's nomination to the president later on friday , after which yushchenko will have 15 days to submit it to parliament for confirmation , and would move quickly to form a new cabinet . it was not clear whether yushchenko 's our ukraine party would join the new union to form a so-called " wide coalition " that would unite both pro-western and pro-russian forces . slowi n g nato , but n ot eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-western yushchenko is not ruling out a coalition with his former rival analysts say a wide coalition would slow kiev 's aim to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but would not affect the drive toward membership of the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and would provide stability to push through economic reforms . in a televised interview , yushchenko said that he did not see our ukraine in the role of the opposition , saying its absence from power would " lead to a serious revision of policies . " in earlier remarks to reporters , yushchenko said a wide coalition would be the best option , but admitted that a new majority could exclude his party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 08.07.2006 world cup final : italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy are looking for their first world cup title since 1982 profiles of the possible starting line-up for the italy team for the 2006 world cup final against france in berlin . gianluigi buffon position : goalkeeper club : juventus age : 28 caps : 66 been in imperious form throughout the tournament , seemingly thriving off the external pressures of allegations about his betting on matches , juventus being threatened with demotion for alleged match-fixing and the apparent suicide attempt of former team-mate gianluca pessotto .
conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

jürgen klinsmann will need to dig deep into this bag of motivational tricks to get his downcast germany team up and ready for the third place play-off game against portugal in stuttgart on saturday . klinsmann , still considering his own future after tuesday 's bitter last gasp defeat to italy in the semi-final , will try and eliminate any thoughts that this last game of the hosts ' world cup is a lame duck match and that taking bronze is an achievement worth striving for . traditionally , the third place match is a lethargic affair played out by two emotionally shattered teams who would much rather have their feet up at home enjoying that last days of their summer break while wallowing in what could have been . while germany 's opponents portugal will be downcast after failing to reach their first ever world cup final after losing to a marginally better france team by a single penalty , the home team will have a particularly hard job to lift themselves due to the manner of their own elimination and the effect it had on the entire nation . portugal 's expectations may have been surpassed by making the last four for the first time since 1966 .
but germany 's were crushed despite klinsmann 's own admission that the semi-final was the target for his team . however , as professionals competing for a final position in the tournament in front of their own raucous and intensely proud support , klinsmann 's job of lifting his traumatized players will surely be made easier . " we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate . " we want to give a good performance on saturday to give the supporters something to cheer about it , " klinsmann said .
" we wanted to be in berlin for the big final but we have to settle for this mini final in stuttgart . " top scorer klose a doubt , ballack out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose may not get the chance to add to his five goals there is also the small matter of who finishes as the top scorer in the competition , with germany 's miroslav klose currently out in front in the race for the golden boot with five goals . with thierry henry on three and luca toni on two , klose will hope to extend his lead over the france and italy strikers , who face each other in sunday 's final . klose , however , is battling for fitness and may miss the match with a calf problem .
germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .
we 'll go on to the field with the same dedication we 've shown so far . " portugal lege n d figo bids farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figo will bow out after the third place game portugal 's luis figo is set to bring the curtain down on his glittering international career in stuttgart .
the inter milan winger retired after euro 2004 but came back for one last crack at a major title . on saturday the 33-year-old will win his 127th and final cap and he wants to sign off with a win . " we want to finish off with a win over germany , " figo said .
" it was disappointing to lose the semi-final but we have to try and win this game for the fans . " possible teams : germa n y -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : oliver kahn ; jens nowotny , christoph metzelder , robert huth , philipp lahm ; bernd schneider , sebastian kehl , michael ballack , tim borowski ; lukas podolski , miroslav klose . portugal -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : ricardo ; paulo ferreira , fernando meira , ricardo costa , nuno valente ; costinho , maniche , luis figo , cristiano ronaldo , deco ; pauleta dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two late extra-time goals kill off germany 's world cup dream italy scored two sensational late goals in extra-time to book their place in the world cup final for the first time in 12 years with their 2-0 win crushing the dreams of host nation germany in dortmund on tuesday .

once germany surrendered , it acted as a headquarters for british troops . efforts were made to erase stadium 's nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated stadium was reopened in july 2004 its name was changed from the reichssportfeld to olympiastadion and it was gradually ' de-nazified ' - emblems of the regime were removed . in 1974 , the stadium was partially roofed to host three matches as west germany staged the world cup , but it had a peripheral role in the tournament and the final was played in munich . the renovated stadium now occupies a central role in the german sports and cultural calendar : it is home to bundesliga club hertha berlin , is used for the german cup final and after the world cup final it will host concerts given by the rolling stones and robbie williams . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

a controversial choice as no.1 keeper ahead of gregory coupet , barthez has looked vulnerable to shots from distance . eric abidal position : fullback club : lyon age : 26 caps : 13 a pacy fullback who likes to get forward in attack , abidal has been a key figure in the lyon side which clinched its fifth successive french championship this season .
back to full fitness after suffering a foot injury late last year , abidal has become a favorite of coach raymond domenech since his debut in 2004 . william gallas position : centre-half club : chelsea age : 26 caps : 46 has been a revelation for france after being given an extended run in his preferred position at the heart of the defense .
skilful on the ball and strong in the tackle , gallas has shown the sort of form which have made him such an invaluable member of chelsea 's english premiership-winning side . lilian thuram position : centre-half club : juventus age : 34 caps : 120 the most capped player in french history , thuram returned to international duty last year after retiring following les bleus dreadful euro 2004 campaign .
has repaid domenech 's faith with some defensive displays that have been right out of the top draw .
man-of-the-match in semi-final win over portugal . willy sagnol position : fullback club : bayern munich age : 29 caps : 44 a long-term understudy to the now retired bixente lizarazu , sagnol was a vocal critic of his treatment by successive french coaches but has now blossomed under domenech .
a skilful defender who started his career as a striker , sagnol is adept at turning defense into attack . claude makelele position : midfield club : chelsea : age : 33 caps : 49 another one of france 's golden oldies who came out of retirement to help the squad qualify for the world cup .
makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .
struggled with a groin injury last season but has played himself back into form at the world cup with two man-of-the-match performances and two goals . florent malouda position : midfield club : lyon age : 26 caps : 18 one of a new generation of french players that domenech has integrated into the old guard , malouda is an elusive winger capable of troubling the meanest defenses with his ability to dribble at pace .
a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .
a dynamic , jack-in-the-box kind of winger , ribery contributed an important goal in the second round win over spain and is a key member of the starting line-up . zinedine zidane position : midfield club : real madrid age : 34 caps : 107 quite simply the finest player of his generation .
the inspiration behind every significant french victory over the past decade , zidane will retire from football after the world cup final .
wonderful ball control , superb vision and a lethal finisher : zidane is the complete footballer . thierry henry position : striker club : arsenal age : 28 caps : 84 has never quite managed to reproduce at international level the mesmerizing form he displays for his club , but henry is without question one of the top three or four players in the world .
has been forced to operate in an unfamiliar lone striker role at the world cup but has still scored three times . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures interviews the stars have their say world cup stars talk to dw-world.de about the tournament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup . " katrin jäger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting germany 's language melting pot since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .
half a year later , the so-called " integration courses " are well underway . -lrb- june 19 , 2005 -rrb- german schools trail significantly in immigrant education a newly published pisa study reveals that children of immigrants have fewer chances to succeed in german schools than they do in almost any other industrial state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de match reports -pipe- 08.07.2006 klinsmann rallies team for anti-climactic " mini " final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will klinsmann get to celebrate like this on saturday ?
jürgen klinsmann will need to dig deep into this bag of motivational tricks to get his downcast germany team up and ready for the third place play-off game against portugal in stuttgart on saturday . klinsmann , still considering his own future after tuesday 's bitter last gasp defeat to italy in the semi-final , will try and eliminate any thoughts that this last game of the hosts ' world cup is a lame duck match and that taking bronze is an achievement worth striving for . traditionally , the third place match is a lethargic affair played out by two emotionally shattered teams who would much rather have their feet up at home enjoying that last days of their summer break while wallowing in what could have been . while germany 's opponents portugal will be downcast after failing to reach their first ever world cup final after losing to a marginally better france team by a single penalty , the home team will have a particularly hard job to lift themselves due to the manner of their own elimination and the effect it had on the entire nation . portugal 's expectations may have been surpassed by making the last four for the first time since 1966 .
but germany 's were crushed despite klinsmann 's own admission that the semi-final was the target for his team . however , as professionals competing for a final position in the tournament in front of their own raucous and intensely proud support , klinsmann 's job of lifting his traumatized players will surely be made easier . " we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate . " we want to give a good performance on saturday to give the supporters something to cheer about it , " klinsmann said .
" we wanted to be in berlin for the big final but we have to settle for this mini final in stuttgart . " top scorer klose a doubt , ballack out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose may not get the chance to add to his five goals there is also the small matter of who finishes as the top scorer in the competition , with germany 's miroslav klose currently out in front in the race for the golden boot with five goals . with thierry henry on three and luca toni on two , klose will hope to extend his lead over the france and italy strikers , who face each other in sunday 's final . klose , however , is battling for fitness and may miss the match with a calf problem .
germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .
we 'll go on to the field with the same dedication we 've shown so far . " portugal lege n d figo bids farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figo will bow out after the third place game portugal 's luis figo is set to bring the curtain down on his glittering international career in stuttgart .
the inter milan winger retired after euro 2004 but came back for one last crack at a major title . on saturday the 33-year-old will win his 127th and final cap and he wants to sign off with a win . " we want to finish off with a win over germany , " figo said .
" it was disappointing to lose the semi-final but we have to try and win this game for the fans . " possible teams : germa n y -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : oliver kahn ; jens nowotny , christoph metzelder , robert huth , philipp lahm ; bernd schneider , sebastian kehl , michael ballack , tim borowski ; lukas podolski , miroslav klose . portugal -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : ricardo ; paulo ferreira , fernando meira , ricardo costa , nuno valente ; costinho , maniche , luis figo , cristiano ronaldo , deco ; pauleta dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two late extra-time goals kill off germany 's world cup dream italy scored two sensational late goals in extra-time to book their place in the world cup final for the first time in 12 years with their 2-0 win crushing the dreams of host nation germany in dortmund on tuesday .

jürgen klinsmann will need to dig deep into this bag of motivational tricks to get his downcast germany team up and ready for the third place play-off game against portugal in stuttgart on saturday . klinsmann , still considering his own future after tuesday 's bitter last gasp defeat to italy in the semi-final , will try and eliminate any thoughts that this last game of the hosts ' world cup is a lame duck match and that taking bronze is an achievement worth striving for . traditionally , the third place match is a lethargic affair played out by two emotionally shattered teams who would much rather have their feet up at home enjoying that last days of their summer break while wallowing in what could have been . while germany 's opponents portugal will be downcast after failing to reach their first ever world cup final after losing to a marginally better france team by a single penalty , the home team will have a particularly hard job to lift themselves due to the manner of their own elimination and the effect it had on the entire nation . portugal 's expectations may have been surpassed by making the last four for the first time since 1966 .
but germany 's were crushed despite klinsmann 's own admission that the semi-final was the target for his team . however , as professionals competing for a final position in the tournament in front of their own raucous and intensely proud support , klinsmann 's job of lifting his traumatized players will surely be made easier . " we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate . " we want to give a good performance on saturday to give the supporters something to cheer about it , " klinsmann said .
" we wanted to be in berlin for the big final but we have to settle for this mini final in stuttgart . " top scorer klose a doubt , ballack out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose may not get the chance to add to his five goals there is also the small matter of who finishes as the top scorer in the competition , with germany 's miroslav klose currently out in front in the race for the golden boot with five goals . with thierry henry on three and luca toni on two , klose will hope to extend his lead over the france and italy strikers , who face each other in sunday 's final . klose , however , is battling for fitness and may miss the match with a calf problem .
germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .
we 'll go on to the field with the same dedication we 've shown so far . " portugal lege n d figo bids farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figo will bow out after the third place game portugal 's luis figo is set to bring the curtain down on his glittering international career in stuttgart .
the inter milan winger retired after euro 2004 but came back for one last crack at a major title . on saturday the 33-year-old will win his 127th and final cap and he wants to sign off with a win . " we want to finish off with a win over germany , " figo said .
" it was disappointing to lose the semi-final but we have to try and win this game for the fans . " possible teams : germa n y -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : oliver kahn ; jens nowotny , christoph metzelder , robert huth , philipp lahm ; bernd schneider , sebastian kehl , michael ballack , tim borowski ; lukas podolski , miroslav klose . portugal -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : ricardo ; paulo ferreira , fernando meira , ricardo costa , nuno valente ; costinho , maniche , luis figo , cristiano ronaldo , deco ; pauleta dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two late extra-time goals kill off germany 's world cup dream italy scored two sensational late goals in extra-time to book their place in the world cup final for the first time in 12 years with their 2-0 win crushing the dreams of host nation germany in dortmund on tuesday .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .
-lrb- july 7 , 2006 -rrb- vw owner counts his blessings a 21-year-old who had the good luck of buying a volkswagen whose seats were once warmed by the current pope is suddenly flush with cash .
divine intervention ?
no : ebay .

" in front of reporters in parliament , the regions party and the communists signed a coalition agreement with the socialists , who in a surprise move had defected from the pro-western " orange " camp the previous day .
the coalition said it was open to other parties . " we 're not closing the doors , " said viktor yanukovych , the leader of regions .
" they are open for other parties or groups of deputies . " the trio , which controls 240 seats in the 450-member upper rada legislature , said it would nominate as its prime minister yanukovych , who lost the bitterly-contested " orange revolution " election contest to president viktor yushchenko in late 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster of yanukovych the coalition said it would forward yanukovych 's nomination to the president later on friday , after which yushchenko will have 15 days to submit it to parliament for confirmation , and would move quickly to form a new cabinet . it was not clear whether yushchenko 's our ukraine party would join the new union to form a so-called " wide coalition " that would unite both pro-western and pro-russian forces . slowi n g nato , but n ot eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-western yushchenko is not ruling out a coalition with his former rival analysts say a wide coalition would slow kiev 's aim to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but would not affect the drive toward membership of the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and would provide stability to push through economic reforms . in a televised interview , yushchenko said that he did not see our ukraine in the role of the opposition , saying its absence from power would " lead to a serious revision of policies . " in earlier remarks to reporters , yushchenko said a wide coalition would be the best option , but admitted that a new majority could exclude his party . " it 's not out of the question that we could have a situation where the courses of the president and the parliamentary majority differ , " a gloomy yushchenko told reporters .
" i would really like to avoid such a scenario . " tymoshe n ko wo n ' t cooperate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko would rather see new elections the third member of the " orange " coalition , yulia tymoshenko 's bloc , has ruled out joining a coalition that includes regions , warning that it would lead to a return of the widespread corruption that marked the regime swept aside by the " orange revolution . " " a wide coalition is a wide grave for democracy and ukraine 's sovereignty , " she said in a late-night political talk show .
" we will either be in opposition or , if the constitution allows ... we 'll support the holding of new elections . " yushchenko warned that if a new government is not formed by the end of july he could dissolve government and call new elections . the march 26 parliamentary election did not hand any one party enough seats in the legislature to form a government alone .
at present , regions has 186 seats , tymoshenko 's bloc 129 seats , our ukraine 81 seats , the socialists 33 seats and the communists 21 seats . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-russia forces poised for comeback in key ukraine poll ukrainians went to the polls sunday , with pro-russian forces poised to make a strong comeback in the first electoral test for the nation 's feuding " orange revolution " leadership and its pro-western stance .

conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .
this could be , poppe said , something like the question of how islam and christianity approach theater .

" in front of reporters in parliament , the regions party and the communists signed a coalition agreement with the socialists , who in a surprise move had defected from the pro-western " orange " camp the previous day .
the coalition said it was open to other parties . " we 're not closing the doors , " said viktor yanukovych , the leader of regions .
" they are open for other parties or groups of deputies .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .
this could be , poppe said , something like the question of how islam and christianity approach theater .

" the trio , which controls 240 seats in the 450-member upper rada legislature , said it would nominate as its prime minister yanukovych , who lost the bitterly-contested " orange revolution " election contest to president viktor yushchenko in late 2004 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster of yanukovych the coalition said it would forward yanukovych 's nomination to the president later on friday , after which yushchenko will have 15 days to submit it to parliament for confirmation , and would move quickly to form a new cabinet . it was not clear whether yushchenko 's our ukraine party would join the new union to form a so-called " wide coalition " that would unite both pro-western and pro-russian forces . slowi n g nato , but n ot eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-western yushchenko is not ruling out a coalition with his former rival analysts say a wide coalition would slow kiev 's aim to join the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- , but would not affect the drive toward membership of the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- and would provide stability to push through economic reforms . in a televised interview , yushchenko said that he did not see our ukraine in the role of the opposition , saying its absence from power would " lead to a serious revision of policies . " in earlier remarks to reporters , yushchenko said a wide coalition would be the best option , but admitted that a new majority could exclude his party . " it 's not out of the question that we could have a situation where the courses of the president and the parliamentary majority differ , " a gloomy yushchenko told reporters .

" we will either be in opposition or , if the constitution allows ... we 'll support the holding of new elections . " yushchenko warned that if a new government is not formed by the end of july he could dissolve government and call new elections . the march 26 parliamentary election did not hand any one party enough seats in the legislature to form a government alone .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 08.07.2006 world cup final : italy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy are looking for their first world cup title since 1982 profiles of the possible starting line-up for the italy team for the 2006 world cup final against france in berlin . gianluigi buffon position : goalkeeper club : juventus age : 28 caps : 66 been in imperious form throughout the tournament , seemingly thriving off the external pressures of allegations about his betting on matches , juventus being threatened with demotion for alleged match-fixing and the apparent suicide attempt of former team-mate gianluca pessotto .
conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .

hitler ordered the old venue to be demolished and commissioned a new design by werner march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympiastadion in 1936 despite constant concerns that construction was behind schedule , the stadium and surrounding complex was ready in time for the opening ceremony on aug .
1 , 1936 . hitler ordered a halt to any anti-semitic attacks during the games , so that they would appear to the outside world as a celebration of peace . owens took gold in the 100 meters , 200m , long jump and 4x100m relay , and recalled in his autobiography that he had waved in greeting to hitler , who he said returned the gesture . during world war ii , a bunker was prepared under the stadium to house the nazis ' radio network . somehow , the stadium survived the intense bombing of berlin practically intact .
once germany surrendered , it acted as a headquarters for british troops . efforts were made to erase stadium 's nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated stadium was reopened in july 2004 its name was changed from the reichssportfeld to olympiastadion and it was gradually ' de-nazified ' - emblems of the regime were removed . in 1974 , the stadium was partially roofed to host three matches as west germany staged the world cup , but it had a peripheral role in the tournament and the final was played in munich . the renovated stadium now occupies a central role in the german sports and cultural calendar : it is home to bundesliga club hertha berlin , is used for the german cup final and after the world cup final it will host concerts given by the rolling stones and robbie williams . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .

we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2006 germans sample multilingualism courtesy of world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publisher pons got into the spirit with a multilingual soccer dictionary the world cup did n't just bring international visitors to germany ; it also brought a mix of languages onto the streets .
an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup . " katrin jäger -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de promoting germany 's language melting pot since january 1 , germany 's new immigration law offers foreigners living here publicly subsidized language classes .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .
this could be , poppe said , something like the question of how islam and christianity approach theater .

an exception perhaps , but one that proponents of multilingualism hope will change day-to-day life . even though a fifth of germany 's population grew up with a foreign mother tongue , the dominant language on the streets of german towns and cities remains german .
many politicians - and much of the german population - see the growing diversity of languages taking root here as more of a threat than a benefit , and there are few programs devoted to the spread of multilingualism . immigrants in germany must quickly learn the german language , politicians often stress .
that makes sense , said ingrid gogolin , professor for intercultural education research at hamburg university .
but to really belong , it 's not enough to be able to make oneself understood in german , she added . " more is demanded of people - that they come to regard german , as if it were their mother tongue , " gogolin said .
" much of this has historical , and i would say ideological , reasons .
the idea that a country and its language belong so closely together that one can not bear to see them separated from each other developed during the 19th century .
this is embedded deep within our consciousness , and also in our feelings . " gogolin , on the other hand , sees multilingualism in germany as a form of cultural enrichment .
in her view , it 's important that immigrants , their children and grandchildren continue to use their mother tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans of different ethnic backgrounds were united through the world cup " i see this as an opportunity , " she said .
" as a country in the middle of europe , we have to maintain contact with many different populations with different languages .
i conducted a study with small and medium-sized companies , and many of these businesses have profited from their multilingual employees . " linguist michael clyne from the university of melbourne in australia agreed .
he argues that ability in more than one language aids mutual understanding , especially in an immigration country , where many people from different cultural backgrounds live together . " language is a key to another culture and provides insight into cultural relativity , " clyne said .
" it 's too bad that more germany do n't make use of the linguistic opportunities they have and choose not to participate in a multilingual society . " i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .

" i n australia , a differe n t story in contrast to germany , australia places a high degree of importance on maintaining the some 240 languages spoken on the continent .
radio and television stations broadcast in different languages , interpreters are frequently offered when conducting business over the phone , and more than 40 languages are offered in australian schools . " for languages not offered in schools , there are saturday programs offered by state-run schools , " clyne said .
" it does n't matter whether it 's french , turkish , farsi or ukrainian - all languages are given equal status .
in our country , anyone who can pass a high school exam in a foreign language receives a 10 percent bonus . " those sound like dream conditions to aydan özuguz , spokeswoman for immigration and integration in the hamburg branch of the social democratic party .
in her opinion , not enough german schools teach turkish , for example . " it 's a resource - a lot of kids speak it , and of course they would have a much different motivation to learn it if they could actually use it to get a mark that would be of help to them , " özuguz said . immigra n t childre n at a disadva n tage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany currently offers few programs to help immigrant children with language skills the reality in germany is much different .
proficiency in a mother tongue counts for almost nothing , whereas insufficient knowledge of german results in a disproportionate number of children from immigrant families being slotted into the country 's least challenging educational stream , hauptschule , instead of a path that would lead to higher education . " this is a poor reflection on us , " özuguz said .
" other european countries have reacted faster ; they 've adjusted their school systems , found other ways to support immigrant children .
we 're still having this discussion about what we actually want - is bilingualism or multilingualism even a good thing ? " özuguz and gogolin are among the few people campaigning for multilingualism in germany , but they hope that eventually , more politicians will recognize the benefits of having a more multilingual society . " i 've witnessed the joy during the world cup , and seen how so many people here in germany suddenly found their languages so helpful , " gogolin said .
" i wish that this attitude could extend to everyday life in germany .
maybe this is something we could take with us from the world cup .

" we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate . " we want to give a good performance on saturday to give the supporters something to cheer about it , " klinsmann said .
" we wanted to be in berlin for the big final but we have to settle for this mini final in stuttgart . " top scorer klose a doubt , ballack out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose may not get the chance to add to his five goals there is also the small matter of who finishes as the top scorer in the competition , with germany 's miroslav klose currently out in front in the race for the golden boot with five goals . with thierry henry on three and luca toni on two , klose will hope to extend his lead over the france and italy strikers , who face each other in sunday 's final . klose , however , is battling for fitness and may miss the match with a calf problem .
germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .
we 'll go on to the field with the same dedication we 've shown so far . " portugal lege n d figo bids farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figo will bow out after the third place game portugal 's luis figo is set to bring the curtain down on his glittering international career in stuttgart .
the inter milan winger retired after euro 2004 but came back for one last crack at a major title . on saturday the 33-year-old will win his 127th and final cap and he wants to sign off with a win . " we want to finish off with a win over germany , " figo said .
" it was disappointing to lose the semi-final but we have to try and win this game for the fans . " possible teams : germa n y -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : oliver kahn ; jens nowotny , christoph metzelder , robert huth , philipp lahm ; bernd schneider , sebastian kehl , michael ballack , tim borowski ; lukas podolski , miroslav klose . portugal -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : ricardo ; paulo ferreira , fernando meira , ricardo costa , nuno valente ; costinho , maniche , luis figo , cristiano ronaldo , deco ; pauleta dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two late extra-time goals kill off germany 's world cup dream italy scored two sensational late goals in extra-time to book their place in the world cup final for the first time in 12 years with their 2-0 win crushing the dreams of host nation germany in dortmund on tuesday .

jürgen klinsmann will need to dig deep into this bag of motivational tricks to get his downcast germany team up and ready for the third place play-off game against portugal in stuttgart on saturday . klinsmann , still considering his own future after tuesday 's bitter last gasp defeat to italy in the semi-final , will try and eliminate any thoughts that this last game of the hosts ' world cup is a lame duck match and that taking bronze is an achievement worth striving for . traditionally , the third place match is a lethargic affair played out by two emotionally shattered teams who would much rather have their feet up at home enjoying that last days of their summer break while wallowing in what could have been . while germany 's opponents portugal will be downcast after failing to reach their first ever world cup final after losing to a marginally better france team by a single penalty , the home team will have a particularly hard job to lift themselves due to the manner of their own elimination and the effect it had on the entire nation . portugal 's expectations may have been surpassed by making the last four for the first time since 1966 .
but germany 's were crushed despite klinsmann 's own admission that the semi-final was the target for his team . however , as professionals competing for a final position in the tournament in front of their own raucous and intensely proud support , klinsmann 's job of lifting his traumatized players will surely be made easier . " we definitely want to win the match , " goalkeeper jens lehmann said on friday .
" in the olympics the bronze medal counts for something . " playing the match out in his home town of stuttgart may help the germany coach as well as he strives to motivate his players to finish the campaign in style and give the fans something to celebrate . " we want to give a good performance on saturday to give the supporters something to cheer about it , " klinsmann said .
" we wanted to be in berlin for the big final but we have to settle for this mini final in stuttgart . " top scorer klose a doubt , ballack out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose may not get the chance to add to his five goals there is also the small matter of who finishes as the top scorer in the competition , with germany 's miroslav klose currently out in front in the race for the golden boot with five goals . with thierry henry on three and luca toni on two , klose will hope to extend his lead over the france and italy strikers , who face each other in sunday 's final . klose , however , is battling for fitness and may miss the match with a calf problem .
germany will definitely be without defender per mertesacker , who will have surgery on his foot this week , and right back arne friedrich , who is out with a knee injury . germany captain michael ballack will also miss the match with a knee injury that has stopped him from training . klinsmann is likely to give a number of fringe players at run against portugal while jens lehmann is ready to give number two oliver kahn one last taste of world cup action . coach co n firms kah n 's world cup swa n so n g bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann will pass the gloves to kahn for the portugal game klinsmann confirmed the 37-year-old kahn would start against portugal on saturday in recognition of his service to the national team . " i can confirm that oliver kahn will be in goal , " klinsmann said .
" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .
we 'll go on to the field with the same dedication we 've shown so far . " portugal lege n d figo bids farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : figo will bow out after the third place game portugal 's luis figo is set to bring the curtain down on his glittering international career in stuttgart .
the inter milan winger retired after euro 2004 but came back for one last crack at a major title . on saturday the 33-year-old will win his 127th and final cap and he wants to sign off with a win . " we want to finish off with a win over germany , " figo said .
" it was disappointing to lose the semi-final but we have to try and win this game for the fans . " possible teams : germa n y -lrb- 4-4-2 -rrb- : oliver kahn ; jens nowotny , christoph metzelder , robert huth , philipp lahm ; bernd schneider , sebastian kehl , michael ballack , tim borowski ; lukas podolski , miroslav klose . portugal -lrb- 4-5-1 -rrb- : ricardo ; paulo ferreira , fernando meira , ricardo costa , nuno valente ; costinho , maniche , luis figo , cristiano ronaldo , deco ; pauleta dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de two late extra-time goals kill off germany 's world cup dream italy scored two sensational late goals in extra-time to book their place in the world cup final for the first time in 12 years with their 2-0 win crushing the dreams of host nation germany in dortmund on tuesday .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

" he has played a big role in this team behind the scenes and deserves this match . " portugal also have at least one player missing with defender ricardo carvalho suspended and right back miguel doubtful after limping out of the defeat by france . but coach luiz felipe scolari was upbeat ahead of the game and had his own reasons to think that his players would fight hard for the third place title . " we have to get rid of this melancholy , we still have a target , " said the brazilian .
" third place at the world cup is not to be sniffed at .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de features -pipe- 08.07.2006 world cup final : france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 team hopes to emulate the achievements of the 1998 vintage profiles of the possible starting line-up for the france team for the 2006 world cup final against italy in berlin . fabien barthez position : goalkeeper club : marseille age : 35 caps : 86 flamboyant goalkeeper who has been loved and loathed by french fans throughout a colorful career , which included key roles in the 1998 world cup and euro 2000 victories .
a controversial choice as no.1 keeper ahead of gregory coupet , barthez has looked vulnerable to shots from distance . eric abidal position : fullback club : lyon age : 26 caps : 13 a pacy fullback who likes to get forward in attack , abidal has been a key figure in the lyon side which clinched its fifth successive french championship this season .
back to full fitness after suffering a foot injury late last year , abidal has become a favorite of coach raymond domenech since his debut in 2004 . william gallas position : centre-half club : chelsea age : 26 caps : 46 has been a revelation for france after being given an extended run in his preferred position at the heart of the defense .
skilful on the ball and strong in the tackle , gallas has shown the sort of form which have made him such an invaluable member of chelsea 's english premiership-winning side . lilian thuram position : centre-half club : juventus age : 34 caps : 120 the most capped player in french history , thuram returned to international duty last year after retiring following les bleus dreadful euro 2004 campaign .
has repaid domenech 's faith with some defensive displays that have been right out of the top draw .
man-of-the-match in semi-final win over portugal . willy sagnol position : fullback club : bayern munich age : 29 caps : 44 a long-term understudy to the now retired bixente lizarazu , sagnol was a vocal critic of his treatment by successive french coaches but has now blossomed under domenech .
a skilful defender who started his career as a striker , sagnol is adept at turning defense into attack . claude makelele position : midfield club : chelsea : age : 33 caps : 49 another one of france 's golden oldies who came out of retirement to help the squad qualify for the world cup .
makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .
struggled with a groin injury last season but has played himself back into form at the world cup with two man-of-the-match performances and two goals . florent malouda position : midfield club : lyon age : 26 caps : 18 one of a new generation of french players that domenech has integrated into the old guard , malouda is an elusive winger capable of troubling the meanest defenses with his ability to dribble at pace .
a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .
a dynamic , jack-in-the-box kind of winger , ribery contributed an important goal in the second round win over spain and is a key member of the starting line-up . zinedine zidane position : midfield club : real madrid age : 34 caps : 107 quite simply the finest player of his generation .
the inspiration behind every significant french victory over the past decade , zidane will retire from football after the world cup final .
wonderful ball control , superb vision and a lethal finisher : zidane is the complete footballer . thierry henry position : striker club : arsenal age : 28 caps : 84 has never quite managed to reproduce at international level the mesmerizing form he displays for his club , but henry is without question one of the top three or four players in the world .
has been forced to operate in an unfamiliar lone striker role at the world cup but has still scored three times . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

hold a garage sale as soon as possible .
it could make him millions , it seems . it 's probably safe to say that klinsmann is rather busy at the moment .
later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .
he is able to place craftsmen , sales people and technicians more quickly and easily than other agencies . a success story elizabeth metz is 48 , a bookkeeper , and for six months , someone whose job applications were returned either without comment or with a remark about her age .
krüger and his colleagues managed to set up her first job interview since her employment search began . " up until then , i had been given no chance to introduce myself or even simply to talk to anyone at any company , " she said .
" i find that on paper , employers can tell a lot .
but they ca n't really tell what you can really do or how you might fit . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many applications from older candidates are returned without comment these days , stephan aschenbrenner , her new boss , praises her intuition and knowledge .
during her interview , her age was not brought up at all .
and he does n't understand the prejudices of employers against older workers . " with younger employees , i have completely different issues .
after a year , they always want to know how they are going to advance up the ladder , " he said .
" or it might be that they take maternity leave or fail to show up on mondays because the weekend was too rough . " an incredible moment metz is very comfortable in her new job .
and she can keep it until she retires , according to her contract . " i am the oldest here - the team is very young , " she said .
" i have a 15-year-old son myself and have no problems dealing with older or younger people .
i get along with everyone very well .
it also has n't mattered here either that i am older and has been like that since the first day , when i felt i immediately belonged . " metz is a success story for the agency .
krüger is n't able to find jobs for everyone and he wo n't reveal how many he has unsuccessfully tried to place .
still , he is expanding his business to six other german cities . " when we are able to help , it is an incredible moment , " he said .
" then those who get jobs come through the door , sometimes with flowers or champagne in their hands , and say , ' thank you - i am so happy .

conceded just one goal - an own goal - and cuts a calm and authoritative presence in the area . gianluca zambrotta position : fullback club : juventus age : 29 caps : 57 outstanding at right back and had stunning match against ukraine - scoring a rare goal , clearing off the line twice and setting up luca toni for the third goal .
seemingly inspired by pessotto 's predicament - he and alessandro del piero returned briefly to turin to see him in hospital - and adds valuable pace and an attacking threat . fabio cannavaro position : centre-half club : juventus age : 32 caps : 99 another of the juventus defensive pillars .
has been excellent , earning praise from every opponent as the relatively small central defender has never looked troubled , tackled brilliantly and led by example .
looking to avenge italy 's defeat by france in the 1998 quarter-finals and if he keeps his form for the final then he may well see that come true . marco materazzi position : centre-half club : inter milan age : 32 caps : 31 everton fans may be stunned to see materazzi in a world cup final after a mediocre stay there in 1998/99 , however a return to italy sparked a renaissance in the hard man central defender .
plays the bad cop to cannavaro 's good cop .
not as elegant on the ball as the injured alessandro nesta but effective .
scored in the 2-0 win over the czech republic but was sent off somewhat harshly in the second round match with australia . fabio grosso position : fullback club : palermo age : 28 caps : 22 a late developer who benefited from the form of sicilian club palermo in serie a. previous clubs such as chieti and teramo tell a story of unglamorous progress to the top , but has seized the opportunity and has made decisive contributions .
his fall in the penalty area over an already prostrate lucas neill gave italy an injury-time 1-0 victory over australia while his stunning goal a minute from the end of extra-time spelled game over for germany in the semi-final . andrea pirlo position : midfield club : ac milan age : 27 caps : 30 while grosso was the executioner against germany , pirlo was the orchestrator as his delightful pass set up the defender .
deservedly man of the match for the semi-final , he has also shown he can score , his free-kick sending italy on their way in the opening match against ghana .
the ac milan star is tireless , good in the tackle and has great vision .
stop pirlo and italy may cease to function . gennaro gattuso position : midfield club : ac milan age : 28 caps : 46 where pirlo creates , gattuso destroys .
short and stocky , he is the soul of both the ac milan and italy midfields .
snaps away at the heels of his opponents , sometimes too much for both their and the referee 's liking , but managed to avoid a booking in the 2-0 win over germany .
self-deprecatory and honest about his role , he was nonetheless described by spanish paper el pais as " more emblematic in world football than ronaldinho " .
his clash with claude makelele and patrick vieira promises to be not for the faint-hearted . simone perrotta position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 30 aide de camp to gattuso in putting up the barriers in midfield , although tends to get forward more often than the ac milan dynamo .
the english-born midfielder has had two chances at the international scene , having dropped out after the euro 2004 debacle .
a resurgence of form at as roma persuaded marcello lippi to recall him .
reliable and hard-working . mauro camoranesi position : midfield club : juventus age 29 caps : 25 the argentinean 's initial selection by giovanni trapattoni caused uproar and he has n't helped by not singing the national anthem .
has blown hot and cold here , hinted at doing something outstanding without managing to do so .
the pony tailed wide midfielder has at times played like the journeyman he once was trawling along the south american and mexican leagues .
he is no bruno conti - the winger from the 1982-winning side - but italy will hope he can produce something out of the ordinary . francesco totti position : midfield club : as roma age : 29 caps : 57 which totti will turn up ?
the one that held sway in the first-half of the semi-final with germany or the one that disappeared from sight in the second-half ?
may be appearing on the international stage for the last time so will surely want to bow out in spectacular fashion .
too often he has been more show pony than the dynamic creator-in-chief but has partly answered his critics with the ice-cool penalty against the australians . luca toni position : striker club : fiorentina age : 29 caps : 23 flourished at palermo after years of honest endeavor at unglamorous clubs , earning big money move to fiorentina .
tireless and selfless running alone up front got its reward with two goals against ukraine , but was substituted by the time italy struck twice against germany .
may be second choice behind alberto gilardino for final after latter impressed in the semi-final . alberto gilardino club : ac milan age : 24 caps : 23 one of the younger members of a mature side , his impressive goal scoring record at parma failed to persuade giovanni trapattoni to put him in euro 2004 squad .
marcello lippi was not so hesitant and the smallish striker had a respectable debut season at ac milan with 17 goals in 34 matches .
looked out of his depth early in the tournament but made a vibrant performance when sent on in the semi-final , hitting a post .
more mobile and skilful than workhorse toni . alessandro del piero club : juventus age : 31 caps : 78 as mysterious a performer as totti but earned a special place in italian fans ' hearts with the second goal that killed off germany .
an icon to juventus fans after 13 years there , he is perhaps best used as an impact substitute these days as injuries and age have slowed him .
cast as a villain after underperforming in 2002 world cup and euro 2004 , but perhaps he and totti can cap international careers by lifting the world cup . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 picture gallery daily highlights from the world cup the world cup in pictures interviews the stars have their say world cup stars talk to dw-world.de about the tournament .

back to full fitness after suffering a foot injury late last year , abidal has become a favorite of coach raymond domenech since his debut in 2004 . william gallas position : centre-half club : chelsea age : 26 caps : 46 has been a revelation for france after being given an extended run in his preferred position at the heart of the defense .
skilful on the ball and strong in the tackle , gallas has shown the sort of form which have made him such an invaluable member of chelsea 's english premiership-winning side . lilian thuram position : centre-half club : juventus age : 34 caps : 120 the most capped player in french history , thuram returned to international duty last year after retiring following les bleus dreadful euro 2004 campaign .

a skilful defender who started his career as a striker , sagnol is adept at turning defense into attack . claude makelele position : midfield club : chelsea : age : 33 caps : 49 another one of france 's golden oldies who came out of retirement to help the squad qualify for the world cup .
makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .

a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .

makelele is widely regarded as the finest holding midfield player in the world and has been in superb form during the tournament , protecting the french back four zealously . patrick vieira position : midfield club : juventus age : 30 caps : 93 ferocious in the tackle and creative in attack , the senegal-born vieira is regarded as one of the best all-round midfielders in football today .
struggled with a groin injury last season but has played himself back into form at the world cup with two man-of-the-match performances and two goals . florent malouda position : midfield club : lyon age : 26 caps : 18 one of a new generation of french players that domenech has integrated into the old guard , malouda is an elusive winger capable of troubling the meanest defenses with his ability to dribble at pace .
a useful crosser of the ball , malouda is a vital attacking outlet . franck ribery position : midfield club : marseille age : 23 caps : 9 over-hyped as the next zinedine zidane , ribery has gradually grown in confidence over the course of the tournament .
a dynamic , jack-in-the-box kind of winger , ribery contributed an important goal in the second round win over spain and is a key member of the starting line-up . zinedine zidane position : midfield club : real madrid age : 34 caps : 107 quite simply the finest player of his generation .
the inspiration behind every significant french victory over the past decade , zidane will retire from football after the world cup final .
wonderful ball control , superb vision and a lethal finisher : zidane is the complete footballer . thierry henry position : striker club : arsenal age : 28 caps : 84 has never quite managed to reproduce at international level the mesmerizing form he displays for his club , but henry is without question one of the top three or four players in the world .
has been forced to operate in an unfamiliar lone striker role at the world cup but has still scored three times . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

later on saturday , the german national soccer coach will lead his team into their final game of the 2006 world cup , competing against portugal for third place . besides the game , germany 's new favorite hero probably also has quite a bit of thinking to do about his future .
roughly 397 percent of the german population want him to stay on as national coach , but klinsmann has not - at least officially - made up his mind so far . be that as it may , klinsi might want to consider to go through his closets and storage spaces .
that 's because judging by one current auction on online marketplace ebay , his junk could net him a fortune . an old volkswagen beetle cabrio that klinsmann once owned has been put up for sale and as of saturday afternoon , one bidder was willing to pay at least an unbelievable 301,150 euros -lrb- $ 385,170 -rrb- for the car . the auction 's still open until tuesday evening and the price could sky-rocket should klinsmann 's team deliver a stellar performance in stuttgart .
it might just beat the 563,000 euros someone paid for a beat-up ford escort that once belonged to the late pope john paul ii . speaking of popes - the beetle is already going for a cool 110,000 euros more than a vw golf that used to belong to german-born pope benedict xvi . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : klinsi should head to the usa there are plenty of reasons for germany 's jürgen klinsmann to head for the rumored coaching job waiting for him in the united states , and the coincidence that he lives there is n't the biggest one of them .

at the same time , german unemployment agencies are criticized because they ca n't find work for the unemployed . recently , federal minister for labor and social affairs franz müntefering decided that germans should work longer , upping the retirement age to 67 .
great , say the more than 4 million unemployed germans , but where are the jobs ? above all , it is the unemployed over 40 that find it particularly hard to find a job .
" too old , " say potential employers .
they take too many sick days and are too inflexible , the thiking goes . but dirk uwe krüger of cologne thinks differently .
three years ago , he founded an agency which specializes in placing those over 40 , and called it zeit-sprung -lrb- time leap -rrb- . " these people that we place are truly good , essentially like diamonds in the rough , " said krüger .
" and that they are really great is something that employers are realizing too slowly .
so i will continue to push for them in the near future . " fairy godfather he 's the fairy godfather out of an unemployment fairy tale - because he means what he says . he has 2,000 names in his rolodex - all people over the age of 40 .
and he is on the prowl daily , hunting for new jobs for them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering says that people should put off retirement and continue working until 67 " most have already had training , experience or education in one or two fields over the course of their lives , " he said .
" but it is difficult to find something appropriate for them sometimes .
many of the jobs they trained for do n't exist anymore or have changed so drastically that they wo n't fit . " krüger and his colleagues call potential employers and offer them candidates for their openings .
then it can take a day or more before they are convinced of the advantages of a new employee over 40 - their knowledge , expertise and reliability .

hitler ordered the old venue to be demolished and commissioned a new design by werner march . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the olympiastadion in 1936 despite constant concerns that construction was behind schedule , the stadium and surrounding complex was ready in time for the opening ceremony on aug .
1 , 1936 . hitler ordered a halt to any anti-semitic attacks during the games , so that they would appear to the outside world as a celebration of peace . owens took gold in the 100 meters , 200m , long jump and 4x100m relay , and recalled in his autobiography that he had waved in greeting to hitler , who he said returned the gesture . during world war ii , a bunker was prepared under the stadium to house the nazis ' radio network . somehow , the stadium survived the intense bombing of berlin practically intact .
once germany surrendered , it acted as a headquarters for british troops . efforts were made to erase stadium 's nazi past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the renovated stadium was reopened in july 2004 its name was changed from the reichssportfeld to olympiastadion and it was gradually ' de-nazified ' - emblems of the regime were removed . in 1974 , the stadium was partially roofed to host three matches as west germany staged the world cup , but it had a peripheral role in the tournament and the final was played in munich . the renovated stadium now occupies a central role in the german sports and cultural calendar : it is home to bundesliga club hertha berlin , is used for the german cup final and after the world cup final it will host concerts given by the rolling stones and robbie williams . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nazi sculptures at world cup venue spark protest just days before the start of the world cup , a debate about the nazi-era sculptures that still adorn berlin 's olympic stadium has reignited , with calls for the images to be covered up or removed lest they offend guests .

they will visit the institute for theatre studies at osnabrück 's technical college in northwestern germany . university lecturer and exchange representative at osnabrück , andreas poppe , said that the project initially focused " on technical and scientific exchanges in the field of theater pedagogy . " " that means learning with theatre , " poppe said .
" we want to know about their experiences in iran , how theater is used as a learning tool , what kinds of tools are available both here in germany and in iran , and how the field can be expanded . " excursions and theatre visits on the program the exchange participants will take part in excursions and visits to cultural events in germany , such as the international children 's theatre festival in lingen , near osnabrück . the project developers have also planned a combined tour with the german and iranian participants . poppe said he wants the students to work together on the project and to deal with diverse issues .
one topic that will be included , he said , was respect for women . the project , which is funded by the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , also aims to develop a mutual research project .
this could be , poppe said , something like the question of how islam and christianity approach theater .

vatican-based cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo told a catholic magazine such research was " the same as abortion " .
he said excommunication should apply to " all women , doctors and researchers who eliminate embryos " .
scientists in the uk called his comments outrageous and said they amounted to " religious persecution " . "
this amounts to religious persecution of scientists which has no place in modern liberal societies " professor julian savulescu university of oxford cardinal trujillo , head of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , will open the church 's world meeting of families in valencia , spain , on saturday .
he told famiglia cristiana magazine : " destroying an embryo is the equivalent of abortion .
" even talking about the defence of life and family rights is being treated as a sort of crime against the state in some countries - a form of social disobedience or discrimination against women . "
' god will judge ' but dr stephen minger , leading stem cell expert at kings college london , said : " having been raised a catholic , i found this stance really outrageous .
" are they going to excommunicate ivf doctors , nurses and embryologists who routinely put millions of embryos down the sink every year throughout the world ?
" it is more ethical to use embryos that are going to be destroyed anyway for the general benefit of mankind than simply putting them down the sink . "
professor allan templeton , president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists , in london , called the cardinal 's comments " insensitive and unhelpful " .
he added : " i can not really believe it represents the thinking of the roman catholic church . "
professor julian savulescu , uehiro chair in practical ethics at the university of oxford , warned : " this amounts to religious persecution of scientists which has no place in modern liberal societies .

vatican-based cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo told a catholic magazine such research was " the same as abortion " .
he said excommunication should apply to " all women , doctors and researchers who eliminate embryos " .
scientists in the uk called his comments outrageous and said they amounted to " religious persecution " .
this amounts to religious persecution of scientists which has no place in modern liberal societies professor julian savulescu university of oxford cardinal trujillo , head of the vatican 's pontifical council for the family , will open the church 's world meeting of families in valencia , spain , on saturday .
he told famiglia cristiana magazine : " destroying an embryo is the equivalent of abortion .
" even talking about the defence of life and family rights is being treated as a sort of crime against the state in some countries - a form of social disobedience or discrimination against women . "
' god will judge ' but dr stephen minger , leading stem cell expert at kings college london , said : " having been raised a catholic , i found this stance really outrageous .
" are they going to excommunicate ivf doctors , nurses and embryologists who routinely put millions of embryos down the sink every year throughout the world ?
" it is more ethical to use embryos that are going to be destroyed anyway for the general benefit of mankind than simply putting them down the sink . "
professor allan templeton , president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists , in london , called the cardinal 's comments " insensitive and unhelpful " .
he added : " i can not really believe it represents the thinking of the roman catholic church . "
professor julian savulescu , uehiro chair in practical ethics at the university of oxford , warned : " this amounts to religious persecution of scientists which has no place in modern liberal societies .
" presumably god will be the one to judge the scientists , not church leaders . "

bbc news -pipe- europe -pipe- all eyes on south africa for 2010 bbc news / europe graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 8 july 2006 , 07:25 gmt 08:25 uk all eyes on south africa for 2010 by sam wilson bbc news , berlin attention is beginning to shift to the next world cup extravaganza to be held in south africa in four years ' time .
africa colonised a corner of berlin on friday as the emblem for the 2010 event was unveiled , in the presence of the south african president , thabo mbeki , and the united nations secretary-general kofi annan .
african singers , dancers and percussionists drummed up enthusiasm , while a narrator told us the story behind the emblem .
it began , she disclosed , " in the ancient mists of time " .
the logo was revealed and it did , indeed , seem more inspired than the bland creations usually displayed by sporting tournaments .
it features a player about to perform a bicycle kick , against a background of the african continent , half of which is painted in the colours of the south african flag .
the designer , gaby de abreu , told the bbc news website he had tried " to capture the essence of what the world cup in 2010 is all about ... the flair of african football , with the bicycle kick .
" we had to show it was very celebratory as well , that there 's a lot of emotion there . "
intense scrutiny but the event was not really about the badge - it was an unofficial handover to south africa for the next world cup .
it is south africa which will now face four years of intensifying global scrutiny .
germany has pulled off a highly acclaimed tournament .
now people want to know whether south africa match it ?
it will be , after all , probably the biggest event ever staged in africa , and the first world cup held outside the so-called " first world " for more than two decades .
south african president thabo mbeki gave an unambiguous answer to the questions .
" we said we will host in 2010 the most successful fifa world cup and we will keep that promise , " he declared .
tumi makgabo , the presenter of friday 's ceremony and a member of the 2010 organising committee , played down comparisons with germany 's achievements .
" we 're not trying to put together a german world cup , " she told the bbc news website .
" this is supposed to be a south african experience . "
big challenge but while the organisers want to stress that the next world cup will come with an african flavour , they are at pains to insist that south africa can manage the tournament as well as germany , japan or france .
alongside the african masks on the walls of the tempodrom venue in berlin were phrases like " expanding infrastructure " , " tourism " and " sector investment " .
even the story narrator , while eulogising " magic and beauty " and " ancient wisdoms " , somehow managed to weave in the words " modern technology " .
michael sutcliffe , who runs the civil administration in durban , which is likely to host a semi-final , says : " we 'll bring world-class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt .
" we 'll also bring fashion , and colour and life , and variety and diversity .
as a country we 're full of that vibrancy , and we 'll bring that to the world cup . "
sifiso cele , sports editor of johannesburg 's sunday sun , says that the media will scrutinise how the run-up to the world cup is managed . "
we 'll bring world class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt " michael sutcliffe , head of civil administration in durban , south africa but he is equally convinced that south africa will pull off a great tournament .
" south africa has proved we are able to host mega events , " he says .
the media and trade unions and others have demanded that while huge investment goes into the world cup , essential projects like housing and social welfare are not neglected .
mr cele feels the transport networks in south african cities may be the weak link in the programme .
national pride but he is in no doubt that south africans are behind the project .
" when the announcement was made the whole country jumped , " he says .
it is a feeling echoed by another south african in berlin .
thabo tolo is the assistant choreographer for afrika !
afrika ! , an acclaimed musical and dance extravaganza that aims to present a continent united by art and culture .
he is pleased by south africa 's promise that 2010 will showcase the whole of africa .
he says : " it is a good thing that the world cup is going to the rainbow nation - africa as a whole is going to host the world cup .
" all eyes will be on africa now , and all africans will support south africa . "
the organisers of the next world cup clearly start out with a great deal of confidence and goodwill from the public and media .
mzimasi mgebisa , managing editor of south african broadcaster sabc sport , has no doubts about the management .
" nothing will go wrong , " he asserts .
his biggest concern is not whether the world cup will be an organisational success .
nor is he diverted too long by kofi annan 's praise of the " universal language of football " , or thabo mbeki 's " human solidarity " .
rather , he has the same worry as every other football fan worldwide .
" the issue for me will be how our team performs , " he says .
" we 're not here at 2006 .
" if you go back 10 years we won the african nations cup in 1996 , " he says , adding that the years since then have seen a consistent decline .
" do we have enough time over the next two or three years to put up a team ?
i 'm in doubt of that . "

africa colonised a corner of berlin on friday as the emblem for the 2010 event was unveiled , in the presence of the south african president , thabo mbeki , and the united nations secretary-general kofi annan .
the next world cup will be the first on african soil african singers , dancers and percussionists drummed up enthusiasm , while a narrator told us the story behind the emblem .
it began , she disclosed , " in the ancient mists of time " .
the logo was revealed and it did , indeed , seem more inspired than the bland creations usually displayed by sporting tournaments .
it features a player about to perform a bicycle kick , against a background of the african continent , half of which is painted in the colours of the south african flag .
the designer , gaby de abreu , told the bbc news website he had tried " to capture the essence of what the world cup in 2010 is all about ... the flair of african football , with the bicycle kick .
" we had to show it was very celebratory as well , that there 's a lot of emotion there . "
intense scrutiny but the event was not really about the badge - it was an unofficial handover to south africa for the next world cup .
it is south africa which will now face four years of intensifying global scrutiny .
organisers say the next world cup will come with an african flavour germany has pulled off a highly acclaimed tournament .
now people want to know whether south africa match it ?
it will be , after all , probably the biggest event ever staged in africa , and the first world cup held outside the so-called " first world " for more than two decades .
south african president thabo mbeki gave an unambiguous answer to the questions .
" we said we will host in 2010 the most successful fifa world cup and we will keep that promise , " he declared .
tumi makgabo , the presenter of friday 's ceremony and a member of the 2010 organising committee , played down comparisons with germany 's achievements .
" we 're not trying to put together a german world cup , " she told the bbc news website .
" this is supposed to be a south african experience . "
big challenge but while the organisers want to stress that the next world cup will come with an african flavour , they are at pains to insist that south africa can manage the tournament as well as germany , japan or france .
alongside the african masks on the walls of the tempodrom venue in berlin were phrases like " expanding infrastructure " , " tourism " and " sector investment " .
even the story narrator , while eulogising " magic and beauty " and " ancient wisdoms " , somehow managed to weave in the words " modern technology " .
michael sutcliffe , who runs the civil administration in durban , which is likely to host a semi-final , says : " we 'll bring world-class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt .
" we 'll also bring fashion , and colour and life , and variety and diversity .
as a country we 're full of that vibrancy , and we 'll bring that to the world cup . "
sifiso cele , sports editor of johannesburg 's sunday sun , says that the media will scrutinise how the run-up to the world cup is managed .
we 'll bring world class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt michael sutcliffe , head of civil administration in durban , south africa but he is equally convinced that south africa will pull off a great tournament .
" south africa has proved we are able to host mega events , " he says .
the media and trade unions and others have demanded that while huge investment goes into the world cup , essential projects like housing and social welfare are not neglected .
mr cele feels the transport networks in south african cities may be the weak link in the programme .
national pride but he is in no doubt that south africans are behind the project .
" when the announcement was made the whole country jumped , " he says .
it is a feeling echoed by another south african in berlin .
thabo tolo is the assistant choreographer for afrika !
afrika ! , an acclaimed musical and dance extravaganza that aims to present a continent united by art and culture .
he is pleased by south africa 's promise that 2010 will showcase the whole of africa .
he says : " it is a good thing that the world cup is going to the rainbow nation - africa as a whole is going to host the world cup .
south africa 2010 will benefit from a huge amount of public goodwill " all eyes will be on africa now , and all africans will support south africa . "
the organisers of the next world cup clearly start out with a great deal of confidence and goodwill from the public and media .
mzimasi mgebisa , managing editor of south african broadcaster sabc sport , has no doubts about the management .
" nothing will go wrong , " he asserts .
his biggest concern is not whether the world cup will be an organisational success .
nor is he diverted too long by kofi annan 's praise of the " universal language of football " , or thabo mbeki 's " human solidarity " .
rather , he has the same worry as every other football fan worldwide .
" the issue for me will be how our team performs , " he says .
" we 're not here at 2006 .
" if you go back 10 years we won the african nations cup in 1996 , " he says , adding that the years since then have seen a consistent decline .

it began , she disclosed , " in the ancient mists of time " .
the logo was revealed and it did , indeed , seem more inspired than the bland creations usually displayed by sporting tournaments .
it features a player about to perform a bicycle kick , against a background of the african continent , half of which is painted in the colours of the south african flag .
the designer , gaby de abreu , told the bbc news website he had tried " to capture the essence of what the world cup in 2010 is all about ... the flair of african football , with the bicycle kick .
" we had to show it was very celebratory as well , that there 's a lot of emotion there . "
intense scrutiny but the event was not really about the badge - it was an unofficial handover to south africa for the next world cup .
it is south africa which will now face four years of intensifying global scrutiny .
organisers say the next world cup will come with an african flavour germany has pulled off a highly acclaimed tournament .
now people want to know whether south africa match it ?
it will be , after all , probably the biggest event ever staged in africa , and the first world cup held outside the so-called " first world " for more than two decades .
south african president thabo mbeki gave an unambiguous answer to the questions .
" we said we will host in 2010 the most successful fifa world cup and we will keep that promise , " he declared .
tumi makgabo , the presenter of friday 's ceremony and a member of the 2010 organising committee , played down comparisons with germany 's achievements .
" we 're not trying to put together a german world cup , " she told the bbc news website .
" this is supposed to be a south african experience . "
big challenge but while the organisers want to stress that the next world cup will come with an african flavour , they are at pains to insist that south africa can manage the tournament as well as germany , japan or france .
alongside the african masks on the walls of the tempodrom venue in berlin were phrases like " expanding infrastructure " , " tourism " and " sector investment " .
even the story narrator , while eulogising " magic and beauty " and " ancient wisdoms " , somehow managed to weave in the words " modern technology " .
michael sutcliffe , who runs the civil administration in durban , which is likely to host a semi-final , says : " we 'll bring world-class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt .
" we 'll also bring fashion , and colour and life , and variety and diversity .
as a country we 're full of that vibrancy , and we 'll bring that to the world cup . "
sifiso cele , sports editor of johannesburg 's sunday sun , says that the media will scrutinise how the run-up to the world cup is managed .
we 'll bring world class organisation , of that i 've got no doubt michael sutcliffe , head of civil administration in durban , south africa but he is equally convinced that south africa will pull off a great tournament .
" south africa has proved we are able to host mega events , " he says .
the media and trade unions and others have demanded that while huge investment goes into the world cup , essential projects like housing and social welfare are not neglected .
mr cele feels the transport networks in south african cities may be the weak link in the programme .
national pride but he is in no doubt that south africans are behind the project .
" when the announcement was made the whole country jumped , " he says .
it is a feeling echoed by another south african in berlin .
thabo tolo is the assistant choreographer for afrika !
afrika ! , an acclaimed musical and dance extravaganza that aims to present a continent united by art and culture .
he is pleased by south africa 's promise that 2010 will showcase the whole of africa .
he says : " it is a good thing that the world cup is going to the rainbow nation - africa as a whole is going to host the world cup .
south africa 2010 will benefit from a huge amount of public goodwill " all eyes will be on africa now , and all africans will support south africa . "
the organisers of the next world cup clearly start out with a great deal of confidence and goodwill from the public and media .
mzimasi mgebisa , managing editor of south african broadcaster sabc sport , has no doubts about the management .
" nothing will go wrong , " he asserts .
his biggest concern is not whether the world cup will be an organisational success .
nor is he diverted too long by kofi annan 's praise of the " universal language of football " , or thabo mbeki 's " human solidarity " .
rather , he has the same worry as every other football fan worldwide .
" the issue for me will be how our team performs , " he says .
" we 're not here at 2006 .
" if you go back 10 years we won the african nations cup in 1996 , " he says , adding that the years since then have seen a consistent decline .
" do we have enough time over the next two or three years to put up a team ?
i 'm in doubt of that . "

here an opponent and a supporter give their views .
opponent : sister anne williams , church army one of the main difficulties is that the bishop is the sign of unity within the diocese , and to actually have a woman bishop whose orders can not be recognised by everyone ... that causes great confusion .
sister anne williams said she does not recognise women priests there will be those of us who will not be able to make a loyal declaration to a diocesan who is a woman because we do n't recognise her orders .
i do not accept the ordination of women priests was the rightful way for the church of england to go .
i will work with a woman priest as far as i can , but that can not be anything sacramental because i do not recognise that she has a priestly function .
i myself am a woman in ministry and i can work with them to a certain extent - and have done - but i can not recognise that women can have priestly orders .
i look to our lord when he brought together his 12 disciples at the last supper and said : ' do this in remembrance of me . '
he instituted the mass at this time and he did it with his male disciples around him .
it 's been said that he could n't have had women there , but of course he could because he treated women in a very different way to the way they had been treated .
i think that 's a very clear sign for me that the priesthood ought to remain a male dominion .
supporter : robert key , mp and ecclesiastical committee member we must win the theological argument first and i believe the theological argument is sound .
robert key says the theological argument is sound i think the way that st paul taught , you read it in the gospels - there is a lot of evidence .
imagine the shock for st paul turning up in ephesus and finding that all the chief priests were women .
this was a huge education for him which is why he started rationalising and saying ' keep the basic truth of christ message , but move it on ' .
and then the church of england has to decide whether it is in the great and grand tradition of the church since the reformation - and it is , in my view , very much so .
we really ca n't go on when more than 50 % of the ordinans in the church are women but ca n't be bishops .
sister anne is so fortunate because she has a wonderful vocation , she does a fantastic job , but she does n't wish to be a female priest or bishop .
but there is a lot of angst and pain among women with a real vocation for the priesthood and the episcopate - and we 've said no , which i believe is quite illogical now .
it 's theologically sound , in the tradition of the church of england , and it is time to move on .
in today 's debate it 's not really a question of saying is it right or is it wrong , because in principle we 've said yes and we 've had women priests for a decade .
it 's a question of when should we do it and how should we do it .
the message is that the church carries its message forward - the fundamental truth in different ways to different places at different times .
maybe not by 2010 but by 2020 i would be very surprised if there were n't -lsb- women bishops -rsb- .

this was a huge education for him which is why he started rationalising and saying ' keep the basic truth of christ message , but move it on ' .
and then the church of england has to decide whether it is in the great and grand tradition of the church since the reformation - and it is , in my view , very much so .
we really ca n't go on when more than 50 % of the ordinans in the church are women but ca n't be bishops .
sister anne is so fortunate because she has a wonderful vocation , she does a fantastic job , but she does n't wish to be a female priest or bishop .
but there is a lot of angst and pain among women with a real vocation for the priesthood and the episcopate - and we 've said no , which i believe is quite illogical now .
it 's theologically sound , in the tradition of the church of england , and it is time to move on .
in today 's debate it 's not really a question of saying is it right or is it wrong , because in principle we 've said yes and we 've had women priests for a decade .
it 's a question of when should we do it and how should we do it .
the message is that the church carries its message forward - the fundamental truth in different ways to different places at different times .

i do not accept the ordination of women priests was the rightful way for the church of england to go .

here an opponent and a supporter give their views .
opponent : sister anne williams , church army one of the main difficulties is that the bishop is the sign of unity within the diocese , and to actually have a woman bishop whose orders can not be recognised by everyone ... that causes great confusion .
sister anne williams said she does not recognise women priests there will be those of us who will not be able to make a loyal declaration to a diocesan who is a woman because we do n't recognise her orders .
i do not accept the ordination of women priests was the rightful way for the church of england to go .
i will work with a woman priest as far as i can , but that can not be anything sacramental because i do not recognise that she has a priestly function .
i myself am a woman in ministry and i can work with them to a certain extent - and have done - but i can not recognise that women can have priestly orders .
i look to our lord when he brought together his 12 disciples at the last supper and said : ' do this in remembrance of me . '
he instituted the mass at this time and he did it with his male disciples around him .
it 's been said that he could n't have had women there , but of course he could because he treated women in a very different way to the way they had been treated .
i think that 's a very clear sign for me that the priesthood ought to remain a male dominion .
supporter : robert key , mp and ecclesiastical committee member we must win the theological argument first and i believe the theological argument is sound .
robert key says the theological argument is sound i think the way that st paul taught , you read it in the gospels - there is a lot of evidence .
imagine the shock for st paul turning up in ephesus and finding that all the chief priests were women .
this was a huge education for him which is why he started rationalising and saying ' keep the basic truth of christ message , but move it on ' .
and then the church of england has to decide whether it is in the great and grand tradition of the church since the reformation - and it is , in my view , very much so .
we really ca n't go on when more than 50 % of the ordinans in the church are women but ca n't be bishops .
sister anne is so fortunate because she has a wonderful vocation , she does a fantastic job , but she does n't wish to be a female priest or bishop .
but there is a lot of angst and pain among women with a real vocation for the priesthood and the episcopate - and we 've said no , which i believe is quite illogical now .

the sussex and eastern solent coast is said to be nationally important for shark and ray , with " some of the uk 's most impressive predatory fish " .
but local fishermen have seen a decline in catches and the sussex sea fisheries committee has set out to boost stock .
plans include fishing restrictions and prohibition of removal .
all sharks in the area are harmless to people .
other options in the consultation document include closed periods , and rules on minimum and maximum sizes of fish .
top predators prohibition on removal of specific species would apply to both commercial and recreational anglers under the plans .
marine biologist david harvey said : " many species once regarded abundant are now seriously depleted or absent . "
he said many species were susceptible to over-fishing because they grew slowly , matured late and produced few young .
but he said the top predators were " very important in maintaining marine ecosystems " .

hugh fearnley-whittingstall , host of tv 's river cottage series based in west dorset , is backing a marine conservation society -lrb- mcs -rrb- campaign .
diver-caught lyme bay scallops feature on the chef 's menu , but it is the damaging dredging for the seafood which the mcs want to reduce by 10 % .
dredging across the west dorset and south devon bay has doubled in a year .
" we have always believed that wide scale use of scallop dredging in lyme bay is an inappropriate way to collect scallops , " hugh fearnley-whittingstall said .
" we are particularly concerned about the huge collateral damage this practice causes to other species and the interests of other sustainable fishing practices . "
lyme bay hosts scallop fishing , including dredging , which scours the seabed each week .
a ' win-win scenario ' the mcs and english nature say extensive destruction has occurred in the area .
english nature has proposed a " stop order " to fisheries minister ben bradshaw , which , as well as reducing scallop dredging , would prohibit all fishing in the 10 % of lyme bay where the most important reefs are .
a marine bill , currently being drafted by defra after an extensive public consultation , could also enable the bay to become a marine protected area .
dr bryce beukers-stewart , fishing policies officer at the mcs , said : " marine protected areas have clear conservation benefits , and there is also increasing evidence that they can offer benefits for shellfisheries such as those that target scallops .
" a carefully designated protected area in lyme bay could offer a win-win scenario for fisherman and conservationists alike . "

lord goldsmith said he saw no basis for the serious fraud office to re-consider its decision to leave the ex-natwest bankers ' case to the us authorities .
david bermingham , gary mulgrew and giles darby are accused of a fraud allegedly involving millions of pounds .
the men have said they are innocent and should be tried by a uk jury .
it is alleged that in 2000 they advised their then employer natwest to sell part of an enron company for less than it was worth .
tory warning prosecutors say the trio then left natwest , bought into the firm themselves and sold it off for a much higher fee , pocketing about £ 1.5m -lrb- $ 2.7m -rrb- each in the process .
enron collapsed in 2001 after admitting inflating profits and hiding debts . "
the american case was advanced and it was in the overall interests of justice for it to be dealt with by one court " lord goldsmith attorney general the men deny any criminal conduct and have always insisted any case against them should be tried in england because that is where the allegations arise from .
shadow attorney general dominic grieve wrote to lord goldsmith warning that their threatened extradition risked bringing the criminal justice system into disrepute .
but in a letter to mr grieve , lord goldsmith pointed out that the alleged fraudulent benefit derived from funds paid by enron , a us company .
he said : " investigations had begun in the usa and there had been no complaint by anyone in this country .
" the american case was advanced and it was in the overall interests of justice for it to be dealt with by one court . "
controversial case lord goldsmith said the serious fraud office decided not to launch an investigation because " the main evidence was in the usa " and " the alleged fraud could not have occurred without the complicity of the enron executives " .
the home office minister , baroness scotland , defended the attorney general 's decision . "
the information i have had back from the us lawyers is that the bail bond they are going to have to put up is an enormous sum of money , probably in the region of a million dollars " solicitor mark spragg " there are co-conspirators in america who assert - whether it 's true or not of course we can not be sure until there 's a trial - that the three british citizens were involved in that conspiracy .
" a large part of the evidence is in america and that 's what was discussed in our courts . "
the men 's solicitor , mark spragg , said the attorney general 's decision would " send a shiver down the backs of anybody in corporate finance or in the city , anyone who had anything to do with america " .
he also said it was likely the three british men would have to be held in remand in the us because of the large bail bond that would probably be required .
" the information i have had back from the us lawyers is that the bail bond they are going to have to put up is an enormous sum of money , probably in the region of $ 1m . "
the case has proved controversial because the men are set to be sent to the us under an agreement that allows us courts to secure the extradition of british subjects without providing evidence they have a case to answer .

david bermingham , gary mulgrew and giles darby are accused of a fraud allegedly involving millions of pounds .
the men have said they are innocent and should be tried by a uk jury .
it is alleged that in 2000 they advised their then employer natwest to sell part of an enron company for less than it was worth .
tory warning prosecutors say the trio then left natwest , bought into the firm themselves and sold it off for a much higher fee , pocketing about £ 1.5m -lrb- $ 2.7m -rrb- each in the process .

" a large part of the evidence is in america and that 's what was discussed in our courts . "
the men 's solicitor , mark spragg , said the attorney general 's decision would " send a shiver down the backs of anybody in corporate finance or in the city , anyone who had anything to do with america " .

a chill breeze is whipping in from far out in the arctic sea .
as it reaches land it whistles across the vast , flat and open tundra .
up here , inside the arctic circle , the sun shines for 24 hours a day in midsummer .
but its rays are weak , the air still carries a cold tang .
russia 's far north , is odd , otherworldly , full of contradictions , harsh and fragile , inhospitable but fecund , teeming with life .
nothingness the tundra extends endlessly , all leached out colours , smudgy greens and browns , merging with the sky into a distant grey-blue nothingness .
at this time of year the top 30 centimetres of soil is a boggy mess , beneath it is permafrost , earth frozen all year to a depth of several hundred metres .
it is half land half water , bisected by river channels , dotted with ponds and swamps .
clouds of ravenous mosquitoes descend on any living thing .
they burrow through your hair to feed on your scalp .
if you fly above the tundra you can see vehicle tracks , criss-crossing it .
some are 10 years old , the vegetation is so fragile it takes that long to grow back after a car has passed .
and then more signs of human activity appear .
scars across the landscape where pipelines have been laid .
and finally small settlements , huts , drilling rigs and giant metal tanks clustered together .
they are scattered across the landscape like colonies on a distant planet .
everything built on raised foundations , above the level of the boggy land around .
near each colony a cluster of pipes emerges from the ground into a giant tank .
each tank looks like an insect , squat above the ground , latched on to the skin of a host , feeding on its juices .
these are gas wells , tapping deposits a mile or two below the surface .
russia is moving fast to develop its arctic territories , all part of a strategy to become the world 's dominant energy supplier .
it has the world 's biggest gas deposits and already supplies a quarter of europe 's needs .
but it wants to seize more of the european market , and capture consumers in asia and the united states too .
world prominence having lost its great power status with the collapse of the soviet union , russia 's aim is to return to world prominence not through military or political might , but by its control over energy . "
when the g8 leaders meet in st petersburg president putin will demand russia is again treated as an equal " in charge of one of the gas pumping units i found georgi , a wiry , bearded man in his 40s .
next to us from a vent in a pipeline , gas was being burnt off .
it was like a giant blowtorch , even 50 metres away you could feel the heat .
" why are you burning all this ? "
i asked .
" we do n't need it , it 's the by-product of refining the gas , " was the reply .
" but is n't it a waste , ca n't you use it ? "
i said .
georgi looked perplexed , lost for words .
" i guess we could use it , but we do n't , " he said eventually .
russia has so much gas , it does n't even care how much it wastes .
this nonchalance is born of a sense that russians hold all the cards today because they have the gas deposits the world needs .
when the g8 leaders meet in st petersburg president putin will demand russia is again treated as an equal .
his economy may be far smaller than those in other g8 countries , russia 's commitment to democracy may be questionable but mr putin 's belief is that his energy resources entitle him to a place at the top table .
far to the south-west another set of pipes emerges from the ground close to the border of the european union .
this is ukraine , where much of the gas from the arctic is pumped into europe .
it 's a totally different world .
the carpathian mountains rise nearby , green , forested , lush .
' blackmail ' the pumping station is painted blue and yellow , the colours of the ukrainian flag .
russia has already begun using its power as the world 's energy giant .
when it cut off gas supplies to ukraine earlier this year russia was trying to pressure its neighbour into handing over ownership of these pipelines .
the kremlin wants to control not just the source of europe 's energy , but the transport routes too .
in ukraine 's capital kiev ildar gazizullin , a bespectacled , owlish man , an energy economist , was blunt .
" what russia did to us , turning off the gas , was blackmail , " he said .
so i asked : " if russia wants to control the pipelines , should europe be worried ? "
" yes , " he said .
back in russia 's arctic circle yet more gas workers were arriving by plane .
swarthy , weather-beaten workmen disembark alongside managers clutching laptop computers , briefcases , even copies of the financial times newspaper .
out here , far from the world 's eyes an energy revolution is under way .
and it 's changing the delicate , fragile landscapes of the arctic , and making russia increasingly confident and assertive , demanding a new role for itself on the world stage .

a chill breeze is whipping in from far out in the arctic sea .
traditional lives go on here on the tundra as it reaches land it whistles across the vast , flat and open tundra .
up here , inside the arctic circle , the sun shines for 24 hours a day in midsummer .
but its rays are weak , the air still carries a cold tang .
russia 's far north , is odd , otherworldly , full of contradictions , harsh and fragile , inhospitable but fecund , teeming with life .
nothingness the tundra extends endlessly , all leached out colours , smudgy greens and browns , merging with the sky into a distant grey-blue nothingness .
at this time of year the top 30 centimetres of soil is a boggy mess , beneath it is permafrost , earth frozen all year to a depth of several hundred metres .
it is half land half water , bisected by river channels , dotted with ponds and swamps .
clouds of ravenous mosquitoes descend on any living thing .
they burrow through your hair to feed on your scalp .
if you fly above the tundra you can see vehicle tracks , criss-crossing it .
some are 10 years old , the vegetation is so fragile it takes that long to grow back after a car has passed .
and then more signs of human activity appear .
scars across the landscape where pipelines have been laid .
and finally small settlements , huts , drilling rigs and giant metal tanks clustered together .
they are scattered across the landscape like colonies on a distant planet .
everything built on raised foundations , above the level of the boggy land around .
near each colony a cluster of pipes emerges from the ground into a giant tank .
each tank looks like an insect , squat above the ground , latched on to the skin of a host , feeding on its juices .
these are gas wells , tapping deposits a mile or two below the surface .
russia is moving fast to develop its arctic territories , all part of a strategy to become the world 's dominant energy supplier .
it has the world 's biggest gas deposits and already supplies a quarter of europe 's needs .
but it wants to seize more of the european market , and capture consumers in asia and the united states too .
world prominence having lost its great power status with the collapse of the soviet union , russia 's aim is to return to world prominence not through military or political might , but by its control over energy .
when the g8 leaders meet in st petersburg president putin will demand russia is again treated as an equal in charge of one of the gas pumping units i found georgi , a wiry , bearded man in his 40s .
next to us from a vent in a pipeline , gas was being burnt off .
it was like a giant blowtorch , even 50 metres away you could feel the heat .
" why are you burning all this ? "
i asked .
" we do n't need it , it 's the by-product of refining the gas , " was the reply .
" but is n't it a waste , ca n't you use it ? "
