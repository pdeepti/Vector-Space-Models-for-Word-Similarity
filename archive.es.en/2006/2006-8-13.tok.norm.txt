5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : a deserted hezbollah stronghold in the suburbs of beirut after israeli airstrikes israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres sought to put a positive spin on the war 's outcome despite the failure to stem the hail of hezbollah rockets on the north of the country . " i think that we have finished more or less the victors both militarily and politically , " peres told army radio , predicting that hezbollah would end with " its tail between its legs . " trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday . " i think we will be in a much better situation -lrb- on monday -rrb- than we are today , " general udi adam said .
" assuming that the ceasefire will take effect , we will stop the moment we are told .

13 , 1961 , then-us army first lt. verner n. pike watched the berlin wall go up .
he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .

" it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .

but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .

13 , 1961 , then-us army first lt. verner n. pike watched the berlin wall go up .
he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .
" my machine gun does n't have any ammunition . " aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .
" it was a terrible time for people in the east .
it was a joyous time for us to help people be free .
the more people we could help , the better we felt . " dismay at checkpoi n t charlie today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pike decries today 's " tourist trap " pike finished his tour of duty at checkpoint charlie in october 1962 . now 69 years old , he is a retired colonel and lives in north carolina . he returns to berlin frequently and said the checkpoint charlie museum is an accurate depiction of life at the border .
but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .
this was a place where you could see what it was like to be free , what people will do to be free .
freedom is not cheap . " elisa ung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de researchers confirm 125 berlin wall deaths forty-five years after the berlin wall was built , researchers still can ’ t say for sure how many people were killed trying to cross it .

we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .
my cousin was pro-western , but she grew up and went to school in a different system .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

13 , 1961 , then-us army first lt. verner n. pike watched the berlin wall go up .
he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .
" my machine gun does n't have any ammunition . " aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .
" it was a terrible time for people in the east .
it was a joyous time for us to help people be free .
the more people we could help , the better we felt . " dismay at checkpoi n t charlie today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pike decries today 's " tourist trap " pike finished his tour of duty at checkpoint charlie in october 1962 . now 69 years old , he is a retired colonel and lives in north carolina . he returns to berlin frequently and said the checkpoint charlie museum is an accurate depiction of life at the border .
but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .
this was a place where you could see what it was like to be free , what people will do to be free .

he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ceasefire is expected to go into effect on monday with resolution 1701 , which the un security council adopted on friday , the organization plans to deploy up to 15,000 peacekeepers to lebanon keep the peace between israel and the hezbollah once fighting has stopped .
several weeks ago , merkel expressed skepticism about german participation in a un force , indicating that the bundeswehr 's current deployments in dr congo , the balkans and afghanistan had stretched its capacities .
subsequently , israeli premier ehud olmert explicitly asked that germany send soldiers . germany 's highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , said over the weekend he did n't rule out german participation .
though the military had no more medics available , in other areas there was more room for movement , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .
he fled east germa n y i n august 1966 by swimmi n g through a ca n al .
richter later helped 33 people escape before bei n g caught by east germa n border patrols .
after more tha n five years i n gdr priso n s , west germa n y paid for his release .
a former ship steward , richter n ow lives i n berli n a n d offers tours a n d talks at several memorial sites , i n cludi n g a former gdr secret police priso n a n d the berli n wall memorial . dw-world.de : where were you o n aug .
13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .

i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .
he fled east germa n y i n august 1966 by swimmi n g through a ca n al .
richter later helped 33 people escape before bei n g caught by east germa n border patrols .
after more tha n five years i n gdr priso n s , west germa n y paid for his release .
a former ship steward , richter n ow lives i n berli n a n d offers tours a n d talks at several memorial sites , i n cludi n g a former gdr secret police priso n a n d the berli n wall memorial . dw-world.de : where were you o n aug .
13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .

" it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday .

it would be more than two years before she would be able to meet her and the rest of her family in east berlin again . bor n i n 1949 , elke kielberg has always lived i n a side street of berli n 's ber n auer strasse , which was divided whe n the wall was built .
she used to work as a n urse a n d n ow volu n teers as a custodia n at ber n auer strasse 's chapel of reco n ciliatio n , which was erected i n the former death strip after reu n ificatio n . dw-world.de : where were you o n aug .
13 , 1961 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two east german workers put broken glass atop the wall in august 1961 .
the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .
my cousin was pro-western , but she grew up and went to school in a different system .
but the next generation - her daughters and her grandchildren - that 's where it 's more or less disappeared . mathis winkler interviewed elke kielberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constructing the berlin wall read dw-world.de 's package of articles on the berlin wall , 45 years after its construction .
the east german : " i did n't take it seriously " on aug .
13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : a deserted hezbollah stronghold in the suburbs of beirut after israeli airstrikes israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres sought to put a positive spin on the war 's outcome despite the failure to stem the hail of hezbollah rockets on the north of the country . " i think that we have finished more or less the victors both militarily and politically , " peres told army radio , predicting that hezbollah would end with " its tail between its legs . " trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga season 2006/07 : reports to the winter break werder bremen ahead of schalke on goal difference league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bremen stay top as schalke misfire at nuremberg schalke and bayern split points after bremen draw sports -pipe- 13.08.2006 new season brings no new habits to bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose gets away from hanover 's dariusz zuraw reigning champions bayern munich got their title defense off to a winning start defeating dortmund 2-0 in their curtain raiser , and last year 's runners-up bremen kept the first week close after other top teams stumbled . bayern , the winners of back-to-back league and cup doubles , looked far from their best in pre-season warm-up matches but were still able to overrun borussia dortmund . " dortmund had too many chances and we owed a lot to oliver kahn , " bayern coach felix magath said of his goalkeeper 's performance .
" i said we would take some time to get going after the world cup but we have three points on the board and that is all that matters . " dutch international striker roy makaay opened the scoring for bayern after 24 minutes to go some way to putting his world cup misery behind him with a right-footed shot that curled into the corner to the delight of 69,000 fans in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german star schweinsteiger , right , has been on a roll since the world cup game for third place the 31-year-old makaay was heartbroken after manager marco van basten left him out of the netherlands world cup squad but a free summer has left him fit and sharp and he rattled the post after just 27 seconds . dortmund had been pegged on the back foot for most of the first half but their new strike duo alexander frei and nelson valdez offered hope . " we had chances but did not take them and bayern were just that bit too clever , " admitted dortmund defender christoph metzelder .
" they sat deep and we could not get through . " kahn makes it 500 the 37-year-old kahn made his 500th bundesliga appearance in the season opener and pulled off some good saves to keep a clean sheet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was crucial in munich 's opening win " we put the poor pre-season results behind us and got off to a good start , " said kahn .
" it is great to reach 500 bundesliga games .
now i will concentrate on playing many more . " german international bastian schweinsteiger gave bayern the cushion they craved in the 55th minute drilling a low shot past roman weidenfeller . it was a timely strike from schweinsteiger with new germany coach joachim löw watching from the stands less than a week before germany 's first post-world cup match against sweden . early blow to hamburg , schalke nuremberg will enjoy what is likely to be their only week at the top of the bundesliga table after tallying the first upset of the season on saturday with a 3-0 win against stuttgart . two of the teams often tapped to be among bayern munich 's closest competition , however , had to satisfy themselves with draws against lesser competition .
hamburg , who are still fighting for a spot in this season 's champions league , tied arminia bielefeld 1-1 while eintracht frankfurt surprised schalke by splitting points on a goal each . in more predictable results , all three teams promoted to the german top flight suffered losses in their opening ventures .
leverkusen shut out aachen to win by three goals , energie cottbus lost 2-0 to mönchengladbach despite being the better team on the day , and mainz held off bochum with a 2-1 victory .
werder bremen off to good start werder bremen got their campaign to win the bundesliga off to a winning start on sunday with three late goals to secure a 4-2 victory at hanover 96 .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .
it would be more than two years before she would be able to meet her and the rest of her family in east berlin again .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .

i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .

" it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .

but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga season 2006/07 : reports to the winter break werder bremen ahead of schalke on goal difference league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bremen stay top as schalke misfire at nuremberg schalke and bayern split points after bremen draw sports -pipe- 13.08.2006 new season brings no new habits to bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose gets away from hanover 's dariusz zuraw reigning champions bayern munich got their title defense off to a winning start defeating dortmund 2-0 in their curtain raiser , and last year 's runners-up bremen kept the first week close after other top teams stumbled . bayern , the winners of back-to-back league and cup doubles , looked far from their best in pre-season warm-up matches but were still able to overrun borussia dortmund . " dortmund had too many chances and we owed a lot to oliver kahn , " bayern coach felix magath said of his goalkeeper 's performance .
" i said we would take some time to get going after the world cup but we have three points on the board and that is all that matters . " dutch international striker roy makaay opened the scoring for bayern after 24 minutes to go some way to putting his world cup misery behind him with a right-footed shot that curled into the corner to the delight of 69,000 fans in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german star schweinsteiger , right , has been on a roll since the world cup game for third place the 31-year-old makaay was heartbroken after manager marco van basten left him out of the netherlands world cup squad but a free summer has left him fit and sharp and he rattled the post after just 27 seconds . dortmund had been pegged on the back foot for most of the first half but their new strike duo alexander frei and nelson valdez offered hope . " we had chances but did not take them and bayern were just that bit too clever , " admitted dortmund defender christoph metzelder .
" they sat deep and we could not get through . " kahn makes it 500 the 37-year-old kahn made his 500th bundesliga appearance in the season opener and pulled off some good saves to keep a clean sheet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was crucial in munich 's opening win " we put the poor pre-season results behind us and got off to a good start , " said kahn .
" it is great to reach 500 bundesliga games .
now i will concentrate on playing many more . " german international bastian schweinsteiger gave bayern the cushion they craved in the 55th minute drilling a low shot past roman weidenfeller . it was a timely strike from schweinsteiger with new germany coach joachim löw watching from the stands less than a week before germany 's first post-world cup match against sweden . early blow to hamburg , schalke nuremberg will enjoy what is likely to be their only week at the top of the bundesliga table after tallying the first upset of the season on saturday with a 3-0 win against stuttgart . two of the teams often tapped to be among bayern munich 's closest competition , however , had to satisfy themselves with draws against lesser competition .
hamburg , who are still fighting for a spot in this season 's champions league , tied arminia bielefeld 1-1 while eintracht frankfurt surprised schalke by splitting points on a goal each . in more predictable results , all three teams promoted to the german top flight suffered losses in their opening ventures .
leverkusen shut out aachen to win by three goals , energie cottbus lost 2-0 to mönchengladbach despite being the better team on the day , and mainz held off bochum with a 2-1 victory .
werder bremen off to good start werder bremen got their campaign to win the bundesliga off to a winning start on sunday with three late goals to secure a 4-2 victory at hanover 96 .
bremen , who finished runners-up to bayern last season , needed three late goals to overcome stiff opposition from the home side .
the visitors took the lead in the 18th minute when american international steve cherundolo lost the ball in the area and new signing diego beat goalkeeper robert enke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen want to dethrone the bavarians this season five minutes from the break hanover equalized through jiri stajner , who had been set up with a defense-splitting pass by michael tarnat .

it would be more than two years before she would be able to meet her and the rest of her family in east berlin again . bor n i n 1949 , elke kielberg has always lived i n a side street of berli n 's ber n auer strasse , which was divided whe n the wall was built .
she used to work as a n urse a n d n ow volu n teers as a custodia n at ber n auer strasse 's chapel of reco n ciliatio n , which was erected i n the former death strip after reu n ificatio n . dw-world.de : where were you o n aug .
13 , 1961 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two east german workers put broken glass atop the wall in august 1961 .
the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .
my cousin was pro-western , but she grew up and went to school in a different system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.08.2006 israel approves un text on lebanon but continues offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's cabinet has approved un resolution 1701 israel on sunday approved a un resolution on ending the month-long lebanon war but pressed on with bombing raids . a senior israeli government official told afp that 24 cabinet ministers voted in favor of un security council resolution 1701 and one abstained . the lebanese government , which includes ministers from the hezbollah movement whose militia israeli troops have been fighting for a month , approved the resolution on saturday . un secretary general kofi annan said a ceasefire would come into effect on monday at 0500 gmt , raising hopes of an end to the bloodshed which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 lebanese and some 150 israelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : a deserted hezbollah stronghold in the suburbs of beirut after israeli airstrikes israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres sought to put a positive spin on the war 's outcome despite the failure to stem the hail of hezbollah rockets on the north of the country . " i think that we have finished more or less the victors both militarily and politically , " peres told army radio , predicting that hezbollah would end with " its tail between its legs . " trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday . " i think we will be in a much better situation -lrb- on monday -rrb- than we are today , " general udi adam said .
" assuming that the ceasefire will take effect , we will stop the moment we are told .
if it does n't , we could continue .

he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .

" aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .

but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .

he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .
" my machine gun does n't have any ammunition . " aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .
" it was a terrible time for people in the east .
it was a joyous time for us to help people be free .
the more people we could help , the better we felt . " dismay at checkpoi n t charlie today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pike decries today 's " tourist trap " pike finished his tour of duty at checkpoint charlie in october 1962 . now 69 years old , he is a retired colonel and lives in north carolina . he returns to berlin frequently and said the checkpoint charlie museum is an accurate depiction of life at the border .
but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .
this was a place where you could see what it was like to be free , what people will do to be free .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ceasefire is expected to go into effect on monday with resolution 1701 , which the un security council adopted on friday , the organization plans to deploy up to 15,000 peacekeepers to lebanon keep the peace between israel and the hezbollah once fighting has stopped .
several weeks ago , merkel expressed skepticism about german participation in a un force , indicating that the bundeswehr 's current deployments in dr congo , the balkans and afghanistan had stretched its capacities .
subsequently , israeli premier ehud olmert explicitly asked that germany send soldiers . germany 's highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , said over the weekend he did n't rule out german participation .
though the military had no more medics available , in other areas there was more room for movement , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .

i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .

1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .

" it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday .

like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .

it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .

" dortmund had too many chances and we owed a lot to oliver kahn , " bayern coach felix magath said of his goalkeeper 's performance .
" i said we would take some time to get going after the world cup but we have three points on the board and that is all that matters . " dutch international striker roy makaay opened the scoring for bayern after 24 minutes to go some way to putting his world cup misery behind him with a right-footed shot that curled into the corner to the delight of 69,000 fans in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german star schweinsteiger , right , has been on a roll since the world cup game for third place the 31-year-old makaay was heartbroken after manager marco van basten left him out of the netherlands world cup squad but a free summer has left him fit and sharp and he rattled the post after just 27 seconds . dortmund had been pegged on the back foot for most of the first half but their new strike duo alexander frei and nelson valdez offered hope . " we had chances but did not take them and bayern were just that bit too clever , " admitted dortmund defender christoph metzelder .
" they sat deep and we could not get through . " kahn makes it 500 the 37-year-old kahn made his 500th bundesliga appearance in the season opener and pulled off some good saves to keep a clean sheet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was crucial in munich 's opening win " we put the poor pre-season results behind us and got off to a good start , " said kahn .
" it is great to reach 500 bundesliga games .

" i think the world cup will raise the trainers ' and clubs ' willingness to take risks , " he told sport1.de .
" now they know that fans are not only interested in the result , but also in attractive soccer . " fans have been putting pressure on bundesliga sides to match the national team 's aggressive approach as one of the few leading international teams to play with two strikers . not up to bayern to lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has always insisted on results ahead of style many would expect bayern munich , the german league 's perennial favorite with more titles and top quality international stars to their name than any other bundesliga side , to be among the german leaders when it comes to attractive soccer , but there are a number of factors working against them , according to coach felix magath . he said he would like his side to open its style of play and become more attacking than it has traditionally been in the past , but it can not be up to one team to change a league 's direction , especially when there is no pressure on other teams to do so . " we want to play a more attractive style - the players , the coach and the board all want that , " magath told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the wish for a more attractive style is justified , but it can not be achieved because we play against teams that pack their defense and because the pitch conditions , for instance in january and february , do not allow it . " munich won the last two bundesliga championships and german cups but did so with tight defending rather than offensive brilliance , that 's a style that needs to change , according to karl-heinz rummenigge , head of the team 's board of directors . " soccer is a game that lives from fun and joy , bayern has to learn that too , " he said .
" starting -lrb- this season -rrb- we will convey the fun of soccer in addition to fitness , discipline and order . " top names leaving bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen kept klose despite foreign interest despite a record amount being spent in the transfer market , more of the world 's most creative players left germany than came to it . last season 's playmakers michael ballack , tomas rosicky , dimitar berbatov , jan koller and johan micoud all left the bundesliga and not even bayern munich proved to have the drawing power to convince ruud van nistelrooy to make the move from manchester . only werder bremen , who finished second to munich last season , could be pleased with the comings and goings in their locker room . bremen signed 21-year-old brazilian midfielder diego , capped 14 times for his country , for a club record six million euros from fc porto and in arguably their best piece of business held on to german international attacker miroslav klose - winner of the world cup golden boot and recently voted german player of the year - amid strong interest from abroad . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga clubs miss out in international player market german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ceasefire is expected to go into effect on monday with resolution 1701 , which the un security council adopted on friday , the organization plans to deploy up to 15,000 peacekeepers to lebanon keep the peace between israel and the hezbollah once fighting has stopped .
several weeks ago , merkel expressed skepticism about german participation in a un force , indicating that the bundeswehr 's current deployments in dr congo , the balkans and afghanistan had stretched its capacities .
subsequently , israeli premier ehud olmert explicitly asked that germany send soldiers . germany 's highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , said over the weekend he did n't rule out german participation .
though the military had no more medics available , in other areas there was more room for movement , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
he rejected the argument that the bundeswehr was too overstretched for a middle east deployment . around 7,700 german soldiers are currently deployed in foreign missions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon .

" we want to play a more attractive style - the players , the coach and the board all want that , " magath told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the wish for a more attractive style is justified , but it can not be achieved because we play against teams that pack their defense and because the pitch conditions , for instance in january and february , do not allow it .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ceasefire is expected to go into effect on monday with resolution 1701 , which the un security council adopted on friday , the organization plans to deploy up to 15,000 peacekeepers to lebanon keep the peace between israel and the hezbollah once fighting has stopped .
several weeks ago , merkel expressed skepticism about german participation in a un force , indicating that the bundeswehr 's current deployments in dr congo , the balkans and afghanistan had stretched its capacities .
subsequently , israeli premier ehud olmert explicitly asked that germany send soldiers . germany 's highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , said over the weekend he did n't rule out german participation .
though the military had no more medics available , in other areas there was more room for movement , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
he rejected the argument that the bundeswehr was too overstretched for a middle east deployment . around 7,700 german soldiers are currently deployed in foreign missions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.08.2006 israel approves un text on lebanon but continues offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's cabinet has approved un resolution 1701 israel on sunday approved a un resolution on ending the month-long lebanon war but pressed on with bombing raids . a senior israeli government official told afp that 24 cabinet ministers voted in favor of un security council resolution 1701 and one abstained . the lebanese government , which includes ministers from the hezbollah movement whose militia israeli troops have been fighting for a month , approved the resolution on saturday . un secretary general kofi annan said a ceasefire would come into effect on monday at 0500 gmt , raising hopes of an end to the bloodshed which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 lebanese and some 150 israelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : a deserted hezbollah stronghold in the suburbs of beirut after israeli airstrikes israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres sought to put a positive spin on the war 's outcome despite the failure to stem the hail of hezbollah rockets on the north of the country . " i think that we have finished more or less the victors both militarily and politically , " peres told army radio , predicting that hezbollah would end with " its tail between its legs . " trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday . " i think we will be in a much better situation -lrb- on monday -rrb- than we are today , " general udi adam said .
" assuming that the ceasefire will take effect , we will stop the moment we are told .
if it does n't , we could continue .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .
he fled east germa n y i n august 1966 by swimmi n g through a ca n al .
richter later helped 33 people escape before bei n g caught by east germa n border patrols .
after more tha n five years i n gdr priso n s , west germa n y paid for his release .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.08.2006 israel approves un text on lebanon but continues offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's cabinet has approved un resolution 1701 israel on sunday approved a un resolution on ending the month-long lebanon war but pressed on with bombing raids . a senior israeli government official told afp that 24 cabinet ministers voted in favor of un security council resolution 1701 and one abstained . the lebanese government , which includes ministers from the hezbollah movement whose militia israeli troops have been fighting for a month , approved the resolution on saturday . un secretary general kofi annan said a ceasefire would come into effect on monday at 0500 gmt , raising hopes of an end to the bloodshed which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 lebanese and some 150 israelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .

i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.08.2006 germany debates sending soldiers to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is nervous that its peacekeepers could come into conflict with israelis as a ceasefire to the fighting in lebanon begins to look more likely , the debate over whether germany should take part in international peacekeeping there has divided the country 's politicians . social democratic party chief kurt beck reignited the debate about germany contributing soldiers to a un peacekeeping force in lebanon in an interview with public broadcaster ard .
" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ceasefire is expected to go into effect on monday with resolution 1701 , which the un security council adopted on friday , the organization plans to deploy up to 15,000 peacekeepers to lebanon keep the peace between israel and the hezbollah once fighting has stopped .
several weeks ago , merkel expressed skepticism about german participation in a un force , indicating that the bundeswehr 's current deployments in dr congo , the balkans and afghanistan had stretched its capacities .
subsequently , israeli premier ehud olmert explicitly asked that germany send soldiers . germany 's highest-ranking officer , inspector general wolfgang schneiderhahn , said over the weekend he did n't rule out german participation .
though the military had no more medics available , in other areas there was more room for movement , he told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
he rejected the argument that the bundeswehr was too overstretched for a middle east deployment . around 7,700 german soldiers are currently deployed in foreign missions . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel skeptical about sending german troops to middle east german chancellor angela merkel has said in an interview that at the present time she does not support the idea of german troops being part of a peacekeeping contingent in lebanon .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .

my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .

we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .

it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga season 2006/07 : reports to the winter break werder bremen ahead of schalke on goal difference league leaders stuttgart face champions bayern in stiff test bremen stay top as schalke misfire at nuremberg schalke and bayern split points after bremen draw sports -pipe- 13.08.2006 new season brings no new habits to bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's miroslav klose gets away from hanover 's dariusz zuraw reigning champions bayern munich got their title defense off to a winning start defeating dortmund 2-0 in their curtain raiser , and last year 's runners-up bremen kept the first week close after other top teams stumbled . bayern , the winners of back-to-back league and cup doubles , looked far from their best in pre-season warm-up matches but were still able to overrun borussia dortmund . " dortmund had too many chances and we owed a lot to oliver kahn , " bayern coach felix magath said of his goalkeeper 's performance .
" i said we would take some time to get going after the world cup but we have three points on the board and that is all that matters . " dutch international striker roy makaay opened the scoring for bayern after 24 minutes to go some way to putting his world cup misery behind him with a right-footed shot that curled into the corner to the delight of 69,000 fans in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german star schweinsteiger , right , has been on a roll since the world cup game for third place the 31-year-old makaay was heartbroken after manager marco van basten left him out of the netherlands world cup squad but a free summer has left him fit and sharp and he rattled the post after just 27 seconds . dortmund had been pegged on the back foot for most of the first half but their new strike duo alexander frei and nelson valdez offered hope . " we had chances but did not take them and bayern were just that bit too clever , " admitted dortmund defender christoph metzelder .
" they sat deep and we could not get through . " kahn makes it 500 the 37-year-old kahn made his 500th bundesliga appearance in the season opener and pulled off some good saves to keep a clean sheet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was crucial in munich 's opening win " we put the poor pre-season results behind us and got off to a good start , " said kahn .
" it is great to reach 500 bundesliga games .
now i will concentrate on playing many more .

" dortmund had too many chances and we owed a lot to oliver kahn , " bayern coach felix magath said of his goalkeeper 's performance .
" i said we would take some time to get going after the world cup but we have three points on the board and that is all that matters . " dutch international striker roy makaay opened the scoring for bayern after 24 minutes to go some way to putting his world cup misery behind him with a right-footed shot that curled into the corner to the delight of 69,000 fans in munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german star schweinsteiger , right , has been on a roll since the world cup game for third place the 31-year-old makaay was heartbroken after manager marco van basten left him out of the netherlands world cup squad but a free summer has left him fit and sharp and he rattled the post after just 27 seconds . dortmund had been pegged on the back foot for most of the first half but their new strike duo alexander frei and nelson valdez offered hope . " we had chances but did not take them and bayern were just that bit too clever , " admitted dortmund defender christoph metzelder .
" they sat deep and we could not get through . " kahn makes it 500 the 37-year-old kahn made his 500th bundesliga appearance in the season opener and pulled off some good saves to keep a clean sheet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn was crucial in munich 's opening win " we put the poor pre-season results behind us and got off to a good start , " said kahn .
" it is great to reach 500 bundesliga games .
now i will concentrate on playing many more . " german international bastian schweinsteiger gave bayern the cushion they craved in the 55th minute drilling a low shot past roman weidenfeller . it was a timely strike from schweinsteiger with new germany coach joachim löw watching from the stands less than a week before germany 's first post-world cup match against sweden . early blow to hamburg , schalke nuremberg will enjoy what is likely to be their only week at the top of the bundesliga table after tallying the first upset of the season on saturday with a 3-0 win against stuttgart . two of the teams often tapped to be among bayern munich 's closest competition , however , had to satisfy themselves with draws against lesser competition .
hamburg , who are still fighting for a spot in this season 's champions league , tied arminia bielefeld 1-1 while eintracht frankfurt surprised schalke by splitting points on a goal each . in more predictable results , all three teams promoted to the german top flight suffered losses in their opening ventures .
leverkusen shut out aachen to win by three goals , energie cottbus lost 2-0 to mönchengladbach despite being the better team on the day , and mainz held off bochum with a 2-1 victory .
werder bremen off to good start werder bremen got their campaign to win the bundesliga off to a winning start on sunday with three late goals to secure a 4-2 victory at hanover 96 .
bremen , who finished runners-up to bayern last season , needed three late goals to overcome stiff opposition from the home side .
the visitors took the lead in the 18th minute when american international steve cherundolo lost the ball in the area and new signing diego beat goalkeeper robert enke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen want to dethrone the bavarians this season five minutes from the break hanover equalized through jiri stajner , who had been set up with a defense-splitting pass by michael tarnat .
the visitors then had an opportunity to restore their lead , but tim borowski 's penalty in the 43rd minute was saved by enke .
iranian vahid hashemian put hanover into the lead in the 67th minute after being set up by stayner .
inspired changes by bremen coach thomas schaaf turned things around though , as first portuguese substitute hugo almeida , who had been on the field just three minutes , equalized in the 79th minute .
five minutes later world cup top scorer miroslav klose found the net for the champions league participants after being fed by man-of-the-match diego .
two minutes into injury time diego was again provider for another substitute daniel jensen whose shot from close range put the game beyond hanover 's reach .
the other game on sunday saw vfl wolfsburg play to a goalless draw with hertha berlin .
both sides created several chances , but especially wolfsburg strikers diego klimowicz and mike hanke failed to make the most of their opportunities . dw staff -lrb- sms , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dreams of beating bayern return with bundesliga season bayern have won back-to-back league and cup doubles , leaving many soccer fans to hope for an exciting title race this season .

" i think the world cup will raise the trainers ' and clubs ' willingness to take risks , " he told sport1.de .
" now they know that fans are not only interested in the result , but also in attractive soccer . " fans have been putting pressure on bundesliga sides to match the national team 's aggressive approach as one of the few leading international teams to play with two strikers . not up to bayern to lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has always insisted on results ahead of style many would expect bayern munich , the german league 's perennial favorite with more titles and top quality international stars to their name than any other bundesliga side , to be among the german leaders when it comes to attractive soccer , but there are a number of factors working against them , according to coach felix magath . he said he would like his side to open its style of play and become more attacking than it has traditionally been in the past , but it can not be up to one team to change a league 's direction , especially when there is no pressure on other teams to do so . " we want to play a more attractive style - the players , the coach and the board all want that , " magath told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the wish for a more attractive style is justified , but it can not be achieved because we play against teams that pack their defense and because the pitch conditions , for instance in january and february , do not allow it . " munich won the last two bundesliga championships and german cups but did so with tight defending rather than offensive brilliance , that 's a style that needs to change , according to karl-heinz rummenigge , head of the team 's board of directors . " soccer is a game that lives from fun and joy , bayern has to learn that too , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .
bildunterschrift : a deserted hezbollah stronghold in the suburbs of beirut after israeli airstrikes israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres sought to put a positive spin on the war 's outcome despite the failure to stem the hail of hezbollah rockets on the north of the country . " i think that we have finished more or less the victors both militarily and politically , " peres told army radio , predicting that hezbollah would end with " its tail between its legs . " trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .

he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .

these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .

but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.08.2006 israel approves un text on lebanon but continues offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert 's cabinet has approved un resolution 1701 israel on sunday approved a un resolution on ending the month-long lebanon war but pressed on with bombing raids . a senior israeli government official told afp that 24 cabinet ministers voted in favor of un security council resolution 1701 and one abstained . the lebanese government , which includes ministers from the hezbollah movement whose militia israeli troops have been fighting for a month , approved the resolution on saturday . un secretary general kofi annan said a ceasefire would come into effect on monday at 0500 gmt , raising hopes of an end to the bloodshed which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 lebanese and some 150 israelis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli artillery piece fires at targets in southern lebanon from a position along the border in northern israel on sunday but with hezbollah vowing to fight until the last israeli soldier leaves lebanon and israel stressing that it will respond to any attack on its troops or rocket fire , hopes of complete ceasefire in the immediate future looked dim .
over 1,250 people killed israel pressed on with a massive assault involving 30,000 troops after the killing of 24 soldiers in its highest single-day death toll of the conflict , and troops were clashing with guerrillas near the southern port city of tyre .
in what the media have said is the largest ground operation since the 1973 middle east war , israel is sweeping through south lebanon where hezbollah is rooted - some troops reaching the strategic litani river which runs as far as 30 kilometers -lrb- 19 miles -rrb- from the border .
fighter jets also pounded targets in the south , east and north of lebanon , and at least 11 civilians were killed , including a mother and her three children , lebanese police said . the worst cross-border conflict in a quarter century has killed more than 1,100 people in lebanon , most of them civilians , and at least 151 israelis , most of them soldiers , and laid waste to much of lebanon 's infrastructure .

" trade minister eli yishai also issued a stark warning to lebanon even if the ceasefire comes into force , saying : " if a single stone is thrown at israel from whatever village that happens , it should be turned into a pile of stones . " red cross : civilian casualities unacceptable the international committee of the red cross slammed continuing heavy civilian casualties as unacceptable . " it is unacceptable that after more than 30 days of ongoing military operations , all necessary precautions to spare civilian life and those engaged in medical work have still not been taken , " the agency said . in addition to the heavy death toll in lebanon , more than 900,000 people have been displaced by israeli bombardments that have left much of the country 's infrastructure in ruins . the israeli general in charge of the northern command said he hoped troops involved in the expanded offensive will have secured control of most of south lebanon by monday . " i think we will be in a much better situation -lrb- on monday -rrb- than we are today , " general udi adam said .
" assuming that the ceasefire will take effect , we will stop the moment we are told .
if it does n't , we could continue .

it would be more than two years before she would be able to meet her and the rest of her family in east berlin again . bor n i n 1949 , elke kielberg has always lived i n a side street of berli n 's ber n auer strasse , which was divided whe n the wall was built .
she used to work as a n urse a n d n ow volu n teers as a custodia n at ber n auer strasse 's chapel of reco n ciliatio n , which was erected i n the former death strip after reu n ificatio n . dw-world.de : where were you o n aug .
13 , 1961 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two east german workers put broken glass atop the wall in august 1961 .
the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .
my cousin was pro-western , but she grew up and went to school in a different system .
but the next generation - her daughters and her grandchildren - that 's where it 's more or less disappeared . mathis winkler interviewed elke kielberg send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de constructing the berlin wall read dw-world.de 's package of articles on the berlin wall , 45 years after its construction .

he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere .

13 , 1961 , hartmut richter had planned to go swimming with his cousins .
he did so eventually , but not before becoming an eyewitness to the beginning of the division of east and west berlin . bor n i n 1948 , hartmut richter grew up i n the east germa n tow n of werder southwest of berli n .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .

i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

5 , 2006 .
the interview was conducted in german and translated and authorized by the vatican .
gerhard fuchs -lrb- bayerische rundfunk -rrb- : your next trip will be to bavaria .
during preparations for the trip your personnel said you are nostalgic for your homeland .
what are the issues you 'll be speaking about during the visit and is the concept of " homeland " one of the values you intend touching on , in particular ?
benedict xvi : of course .
the purpose of the visit is precisely because i want to see again the places where i grew up , the people who touched and shaped my life .
i want to thank these people .
naturally i also want to express a message that goes beyond my country , just as my ministry calls me to do .
i simply let the liturgical recurrences suggest the themes to me .
the basic theme is that we have to rediscover god , not just any god , but the god that has a human face , because when we see jesus christ we see god .
starting from this point we must find the way to meet each other in the family , among generations , and then among cultures and peoples as well .
we must find the way to reconciliation and to peaceful coexistence in this world , the ways that lead to the future .
we wo n't find these ways leading to the future if we do n't receive light from above .
so i did n't choose very specific themes , but rather , it is the liturgy that leads me to express the basic message of faith which naturally finds its place in everyday reality where we want to search , above all , for cooperation among peoples and possible ways that can lead us to reconciliation and peace . thomas bellut -lrb- zdf -rrb- : as pope you are responsible for the church throughout the world .
but , clearly , your visit focuses attention on the situation of catholics in germany as well .
all observers say there 's a positive atmosphere , partly thanks to your appointment as pope .
but , obviously , the old problems are still around .
just to quote a few examples : fewer churchgoers , fewer baptisms , and especially less church influence on the life of society .
how do you see the present situation of the catholic church in germany ? i 'd say , first of all , that germany is part of the west , with its own characteristic coloring obviously , and that in the western world today we are experiencing a wave of new and drastic enlightenment or secularization , whatever you like to call it .
it 's become more difficult to believe because the world in which we find ourselves is completely made up of ourselves and god , so to speak , does n't appear directly anymore .
we do n't drink from the source anymore , but from the vessel which is offered to us already full , and so on .
humanity has rebuilt the world by itself and finding god inside this world has become more difficult .
this is not specific to germany : it 's something that 's valid throughout the world , especially in the west .
then again , today the west is being strongly influenced by other cultures in which the original religious element is very powerful .
these cultures are horrified when they experience the west 's coldness towards god .
this " presence of the sacred " in other cultures , even if often veiled , touches the western world again ; it touches us at the crossroads of so many cultures .
the quest for " something bigger " wells up again from the depths of western people and in germany . we see how in young people there 's the search for something " more , " we see how the religious phenomenon is returning , as they say .
even if it 's a search that 's rather indefinite .
but with all this the church is present once more and faith is offered as the answer .
i think that this visit , like the visit to cologne , is an opportunity because we can see that believing is beautiful , that the joy of a huge universal community possesses a transcendental strength , that behind this belief lies something important and that together with the new searching movements there are also new outlets for the faith that lead us from one to the other and that are also positive for society as a whole . eberhard von gemmingen -lrb- vatican radio -rrb- : you were in cologne for world youth day exactly a year ago .
you experienced how amazingly willing youth are to welcome others and you personally were very warmly welcomed .
will you be bringing a special message for young people on this next trip ? first of all , i 'd say that i am very happy there are young people who want to be together , who want to be together in faith and who want to do something good .
the tendency to do good is very strong in young people , just think of the many kinds of volunteer work they do .
the commitment of offering your own personal contribution to help the needy of this world is a great thing .
one idea might be to encourage them in this sphere : go ahead !
look for opportunities to do good !
the world needs this desire to do good , it needs this commitment !
then another message might be this : the courage to make definitive decisions !
young people are very generous but when they face the risk of a life-long commitment , be it marriage or a priestly vocation , they are afraid .
the world is moving dramatically : nowadays i can continually do whatever i want with my life with all its unpredictable future events .
by making a definitive decision am i myself not tying up my personal freedom and depriving myself of freedom of movement ?
reawaken the courage to make definitive decisions : they are really the only ones that allow us to grow , to move ahead and to reach something great in life .
they are the only decisions that do not destroy our freedom but offer to point us in the right direction .
risk making this leap , so to speak , towards the definitive and so embrace life fully : this is something i 'd be happy to communicate to them . christoph lanz -lrb- deutsche welle -rrb- : a question about the situation regarding foreign politics .
hopes for peace in the middle east have been dwindling over the past weeks : what do you see as the holy see 's role in relationship to the present situation ?
what positive influences can you have on the situation , on developments in the middle east ? of course we have no political influence and we do n't want any political power .
but we do want to appeal to all christians and to all those who feel touched by the words of the holy see , to help mobilize all the forces that recognize how war is the worst solution for all sides .
it brings no good to anyone , not even to the apparent victors .
we understand this very well in europe , after the two world wars .
everyone needs peace .
there 's a strong christian community in lebanon , there are christians among the arabs , there are christians in israel .
christians throughout the world are committed to helping these countries that are dear to all of us .
there are moral forces at work that are ready to help people understand how the only solution is for all of us to live together .
these are the forces we want to mobilize : it 's up to politicians to find a way to let this happen as soon as possible and , especially , to make it last . fuchs : as bishop of rome you are the successor of st peter .
how can the ministry of peter manifest itself fittingly in today 's world ?
and how do you see the tensions and equilibrium between the primacy of the pope , on one hand , and the collegiality of the bishops , on the other ? of course there is a relationship of tension and equilibrium and , we say , that 's the way it has to be .
multiplicity and unity must always find their reciprocal rapport and this relationship must insert itself in ever new ways into the changing situations in the world .
we have a new polyphony of cultures nowadays in which europe is no longer the determining factor .
christians on the various continents are starting to have their own importance , their own characteristics .
we must keep learning about this fusion of the different components .
we 've developed various instruments to help us : the so-called " ad limina visits " of the bishops , which have always taken place .
now they are used much more in order to speak sincerely with all the offices of the holy see and with me .
i speak personally to each bishop .
i 've already spoken to nearly all the bishops of africa and with many of the bishops from asia .
now it 's the turn of central europe , germany , switzerland .
in these encounters in which the center and the periphery come together in an open exchange of views , i think that the correct reciprocal exchange in this balanced tension grows .
we also have other instruments like the synod , the consistory , which i shall be holding regularly and which i would like to develop .
without having a long agenda we can discuss current problems together and look for solutions .
everyone knows that the pope is not an absolute monarch but that he has to personify , you might say , the totality that comes together to listen to christ .
there 's a strong awareness that we need a unifying figure that can guarantee independence from political powers and that christians do n't identify too much with nationalism .
there 's an awareness of the need for a higher and broader figure that can create unity in the dynamic integration of all parties and that can embrace and promote multiplicity .
so i believe there 's a close bond between the petrine ministry which is expressed in the desire to develop it further so that it responds both to the lord 's will and to the needs of the times . bellut : as the land of the reformation , germany is especially marked by the relationships between the different religious confessions .
ecumenical relations is a sensitive area that constantly encounters new problems .
what chances do you see of improving relations with the evangelical church or what difficulties do you foresee in this relationship ? maybe it 's important to say , first of all , that there are marked differences within the evangelical church .
if i 'm not mistaken , in germany we have three important communities : lutherans , reformed , and prussian union .
there are also several free churches -lrb- freikirchen -rrb- and within the traditional churches there are movements like the " confessional church " , and so on .
it 's a collection of many voices , therefore , with which we have to enter in dialogue searching for unity while respecting the multiplicity of the voices with which we want to collaborate .
i believe that the first thing we need to do is to concern ourselves with clarifying , establishing and putting into practice important ethical directives in society , thus guaranteeing a social ethical consistency without which society can not fulfill its political ends , namely , justice for all , living together in a positive way , and peace .
in this sense , i think a lot is already achieved , that we already agree on the common christian basics before the great moral challenges .
of course , then we have to witness to god in a world that has problems finding him , as we said , and to make god visible in the human face of jesus christ , to offer people access to the source without which our morale becomes sterile and loses its point of reference , to give joy as well because we are not alone in this world .
only in this way joy is born before the greatness of humanity : humanity is not an evolutionary product that turned out badly .
we are the image of god .
we have to move on these two levels , so to speak : the level of important ethical points of reference and the level that manifests the presence of god , a concrete god , starting from within and working towards them .
if we do this and , especially , if in all our single communities we try not to live the faith in a specific fashion but always start from its deepest basics , then maybe we still wo n't reach external manifestations of unity quickly , but we will mature towards an interior unity that , god willing , one day will bring with it an exterior form of unity too . gemmingen : the issue of the family .
a month ago you were in valencia for the world meeting of families .
anyone who was listening carefully , as we tried to do at radio vatican , noticed how you never mentioned the words " homosexual marriage , " you never spoke about abortion , or about contraception .
careful observers thought that was very interesting .
clearly your idea is to go around the world preaching the faith rather than as an " apostle of morality . "
what are your comments ? obviously , yes .
actually i should say i had only two opportunities to speak for 20 minutes .
and when you have so little time you ca n't say everything you want to say about " no . "
firstly you have to know what we really want , right ?
christianity , catholicism , is n't a collection of prohibitions : it 's a positive option .
it 's very important that we look at it again because this idea has almost completely disappeared today .
we 've heard so much about what is not allowed that now it 's time to say : we have a positive idea to offer , that man and woman are made for each other , that the scale of sexuality , eros , agape , indicates the level of love and it 's in this way that marriage develops , first of all , as a joyful and blessing-filled encounter between a man and a woman , and then the family , that guarantees continuity among generations and through which generations are reconciled to each other and even cultures can meet .
so , firstly it 's important to stress what we want .
secondly , we can also see why we do n't want something .
i believe we need to see and reflect on the fact that it 's not a catholic invention that man and woman are made for each other , so that humanity can go on living : all cultures know this .
as far as abortion is concerned , it 's part of the fifth , not the sixth , commandment : " thou shalt not kill ! "
we have to presume this is obvious and always stress that the human person begins in the mother 's womb and remains a human person until his or her last breath .
the human person must always be respected as a human person .
but all this is clearer if you say it first in a positive way . lan z : my questio n is linked to that of father von gemmingen .
throughout the world believers are waiting for the catholic church to answer the most urgent global problems , like aids and overpopulation .
why does the catholic church pay so much attention to moral issues rather than suggesting concrete solutions to these problems that are so crucial to humanity , in africa , for example ? so that 's the problem : do we really pay so much attention to moral issues ?
i think - i am more and more convinced after my conversations with the african bishops - that the basic question , if we want to move ahead in this field , is about education , formation .
progress becomes true progress only if it serves the human person and if the human person grows : not only in terms of his or her technical power , but also in his or her moral awareness .
i believe that the real problem of our historical moment lies in the imbalance between the incredibly fast growth of our technical power and that of our moral capacity , which has not grown in proportion .
that 's why the formation of the human person is the true recipe , the key to it all , i would say , and this is what the church proposes .
briefly speaking , this formation has a dual dimension : of course we have to learn , acquire knowledge , ability , know-how , as they say .
in this sense europe , and in the last decades america , have done a lot , and that 's important .
but if we only teach know-how , if we only teach how to build and to use machines , and how to use contraceptives , then we should n't be surprised when we find ourselves facing wars and aids epidemics .
because we need two dimensions : simultaneously we need the formation of the heart , if i can express myself in this way , with which the human person acquires points of reference and learns how to use the techniques correctly .
and that 's what we try to do .
throughout africa and in many countries in asia , we have a vast network of every level of school where people can learn , form a true conscience and acquire professional ability which gives them autonomy and freedom .
but in these schools we try to communicate more than know-how , rather to form human beings capable of reconciliation , who know that we must build and not destroy and who have the necessary references to be able to live together .
in much of africa , relations between christians and muslims are exemplary .
the bishops have formed common commissions together with the muslims to try and create peace in situations of conflict .
this schools network , dedicated to human learning and formation , is very important .
it 's completed by a network of hospitals and assistance centers that reach even the most remote villages .
in many areas , following the destruction of war , the church is the only structure that remains intact .
this is a fact !
we offer treatment , treatment to aids victims too , and we offer education , helping to establish good relationships with others .
so i think we should correct that image that sees the church as spreading severe " no 's . "
we work a lot in africa so that the various dimensions of formation can be integrated and so that it becomes possible to overcome violence and epidemics , that includes malaria and tuberculosis as well . fuchs : christia nity has spread around the world starting from europe .
now many people think that the future of the church is to be found in other continents .
is that true ?
or , in other words , what is the future of christianity in europe , where it looks like it 's being reduced to the private affair of a minority ? i 'd like to introduce a few subtleties .
it 's true , as we know , that christianity began in the near east .
and for a long time its main development continued there .
then it spread in asia , much more than what we think today after the changes brought about by islam .
precisely for this reason its axis moved noticeably towards the west and europe .
europe - we 're proud and pleased to say so - further developed christianity in its broader intellectual and cultural dimensions .
but i think it 's important to remind ourselves about the eastern christians because there 's the present danger of them emigrating , these christians who have always been an important minority living in a fruitful relationship with the surrounding reality .
there 's a great danger that these places where christianity had its origins will be left without christians .
i think we need to help them a lot so that they can stay .
but getting back to your question : europe definitely became the center of christianity and its missionary movement .
today , other continents and other cultures play with equal importance in the concert of world history .
in this way the number of voices in the church grows , and this is a good thing .
it 's good that different temperaments can express themselves , the special gifts of africa , asia and america , latin america in particular .
of course , they are all touched not only by the word of christianity , but by the secular message of this world that carries to other continents the disruptive forces we have already experienced .
all the bishops from different parts of the world say : we still need europe , even if europe is only a part of a greater whole .
we still carry the responsibility that come from our experiences , from the science and technology that was developed here , from our liturgical experience , to our traditions , the ecumenical experiences we have accumulated : all this is very important for the other continents too .
so it 's important that today we do n't give up , feeling sorry for ourselves and saying : " look at us , we just a minority , let 's at least try and preserve our small number ! "
we have to keep our dynamism alive , open relationships of exchange , so that new strength for us comes from there .
today there are indian and african priests in europe , even in canada , where many african priests work in a very interesting way .
there 's this reciprocal give and take .
but if we receive more in the future we also need to continue giving with courage and with growing dynamism . bellut : this is a subject that 's already bee n touched partially .
when it comes to important political or scientific decisions , modern society does n't base itself on christian values and the church , according to research , is considered as simply a warning voice or a controlling voice .
should n't the church come out of this defensive position and assume a more positive attitude with regard to the building of the future ? i 'd say that , in any case , we have to stress better what we want that is positive .
and we need to do this , above all , in dialogue with cultures and religions because , as i think i 've already said , the african continent , the african spirit and the asian spirit too , are horrified by the coldness of our rationality .
it 's important for them to see that 's not all we are .
on the other hand , it 's important that our secular world comes to understand that the christian faith is not an impediment but a bridge for dialogue with other worlds .
it 's not right to think that a purely rational culture has an easier approach to other religions just because it 's tolerant .
to a large extent what 's missing is a " religious center-piece " which can act as point of departure and arrival for those who want to enter into a relationship .
that 's why we must , and we can , show that , precisely because of the new intercultural environment in which we live , pure rationality separated from god is insufficient .
we need a wider rationality that sees god in harmony with reason and is aware that the christian faith that developed in europe is also a means to bring together reason and culture and to integrate them with action in a single and comprehensive vision .
in this sense i believe we have an important task , namely to show that this word which we possess , is n't part of the trash of history , so to speak , but it 's necessary today . gemmingen : let 's talk about your travels .
you live in the vatican and maybe it hurts you to be far from people and separated from the world , even in the beautiful surroundings of castelgandolfo .
you 'll be turning 80 soon .
do you think that , with god 's grace , you 'll be able to make many more trips ?
do you have any idea of where you 'd like to go ?
to the holy land , or brazil ?
do you know already ? to tell the truth i 'm not that lonely .
of course there are , you may say , the walls that make it more difficult to get in , but there 's also a " pontifical family , " lots of visitors every day , especially when i 'm in rome .
the bishops come and other people , there are state visits .
there are also personalities who want to talk to me personally , and not just about political issues .
in this sense there are all kinds of encounters that , thank god , i have continually .
and it 's also important that the seat of the successor of peter be a place of encounter , do n't you think ?
from the time of john xxiii onwards , the pendulum began to swing in the other direction too : the popes started going out to visit others .
i have to say that i 've never felt strong enough to plan many long trips .
but where such a trip allows me to communicate a message or where , shall i say , it 's in response to a sincere request , i 'd like to go - in the " measure " that 's possible for me .
some are already planned : next year there 's the meeting of celam , the latin american episcopal council , in brazil , and i think that being there is an important step in the context of what latin america is living so intensely , to strengthen the hope that 's so alive in that part of the world .
then i 'd like to visit the holy land , and i hope to visit it in a time of peace .
for the rest , we 'll see what providence has in store for me . gemmingen : austrians also speak german and they are waiting for you at mariazell . yes , it 's been agreed .
quite simply i promised them , a little imprudently .
i really liked that place and i said : yes , i 'll come back to the magna mater austriae .
of course , this became a promise that i will keep , that i will keep happily . gemmingen : i admire you every wednesday when you hold your general audience .
50,000 people come .
it must be very tiring .
how do you manage to hold out ? yes , the good lord gives me the necessary strength .
when you see the warm welcome , you 're obviously encouraged . lanz : you 've just said you made a rather imprudent promise .
does that mean that , despite your ministry , despite the many protocols and limitations , you have n't lost your spontaneity ? i try , in any case .
as much as things are fixed , i 'd like to keep doing some things that are purely personal . fuchs : women are very active in many different areas of the catholic church .
should n't their contribution become more clearly visible , even in positions of higher responsibility in the church ? we reflect a lot about this subject , of course .
as you know , we believe that our faith and the constitution of the college of the apostles , obliges us and does n't allow us to confer priestly ordination on women .
but we should n't think either that the only role one can have in the church is that of being a priest .
there are lots of tasks and functions in the history of the church - starting with the sisters of the fathers of the church , up to the middle ages when great women played fundamental roles , up until modern times .
think about hildegard of bingen who protested strongly before the bishops and the pope , of catherine of siena and brigit of sweden .
in our own time too women , and we with them , must look for their right place , so to speak .
today they are very present in the departments of the holy see .
but there 's a juridical problem : according to canon law the power to take legally binding decisions is limited to sacred orders .
so there are limitations from this point of view but i believe that women themselves , with their energy and strength , with their superiority , with what i 'd call their " spiritual power , " will know how to make their own space .
and we will have to try and listen to god so as not to stand in their way but , on the contrary , to rejoice when the female element achieves the fully effective place in the church best suited to her , starting with the mother of god and with mary magdalene . fuchs : recently there 's been talk of a new fascination with catholicism .
what is the attraction and the future of this ancient institution ? i 'd say that the entire pontificate of john paul ii drew people 's attention and brought them together .
what happened at the time of his death remains something historically very special : how hundreds of thousands of people flowed towards st peter 's square in an orderly fashion , stood for hours , and while they should have collapsed , they resisted as if moved by an inner strength .
then we relived the experience on the occasion of the inauguration of my pontificate and again in cologne .
it 's very beautiful when the experience of community becomes an experience of faith at the same time .
when the experience of community does n't happen just anywhere but that this experience becomes more alive and gives to catholicism its luminous intensity right there in the places of the faith .
of course , this has to continue in everyday life .
the two must go together .
on one hand , the great moments during which one feels how good it is to be there , that the lord is present and that we form a great community reconciled beyond all boundaries .
from here we get the impetus to resist during the tiring pilgrimage of everyday existence , to live starting from these bright points and turning towards them , knowing how to invite others to join our pilgrim community .
i 'd like to take this opportunity to say : i blush when i think of all the preparations that are made for my visit , for everything that people do .
my house was freshly painted , a professional school redid the fence .
the evangelical professor helped to do the fence .
and these are just small details but they 're a sign of the many things that are done .
i find all of this extraordinary , and i do n't think it 's for me , but rather a sign of wanting to be part of this faith community and to serve one another .
demonstrating this solidarity means letting ourselves be inspired by the lord .
it 's something that touches me and i 'd like to express my gratitude with all my heart . lanz : you spoke about the experience of community .
you 'll be coming to germany for the second time following your election .
after world youth day and , for different reasons , after the world soccer championships , the atmosphere seems to have changed .
the impression is that germans have become more open to the world , more tolerant and more joyful .
what would you still like from us germans ? i 'd say that from the end of the second world war german society began an inner transformation .
the german way of thinking too , which was further reinforced after reunification .
we have become more deeply part of world society and , naturally , we have been changed by its mentality .
aspects of the german character which others were n't aware of before , have come to light .
perhaps we were always depicted too much as always very disciplined and reserved , which has some basis in truth .
but if we now see better that which everyone is seeing , i think it 's lovely : germans are n't just reserved , punctual and disciplined , they are also spontaneous , happy and hospitable .
this is very lovely .
this is my hope : that these virtues may continue to grow and that they may last and may receive added impetus from the christian faith . gemmingen : your predecessor beatified and canonized a huge number of christians .
some people say even too many .
this is my question : beatifications and canonizations only bring something new to the church when these people are seen as true models .
germany produces relatively few saints and blessed in comparison with other countries .
can anything be done to develop this pastoral sphere so that beatifications and canonizations can give real pastoral fruit ? in the beginning i also thought that the large number of beatifications was almost overwhelming and that perhaps we needed to be more selective ; choosing figures that entered our consciousness more clearly .
meanwhile , i decentralized the beatifications in order to make these figures more visible in the specific places they came from .
perhaps a saint from guatemala does n't interest us in germany and vice versa , someone from altötting is of no interest in los angeles , and so on , right ?
i also think that this decentralization is more in keeping with the collegiality of the episcopate , with its collegial structures , and that it 's suitable for stressing how different countries have their own personalities and these are especially effective in these countries .
i 've also seen how these beatifications in different places touch vast numbers of people and that people say : " at last , this one is one of us ! "
they pray to him and are inspired .
the blessed soul belongs to them and we 're happy there are lots of them .
and if , gradually , with the development of a global society , we too get to know them , that 's wonderful .
but it 's especially important that multiplicity exists in this field also because it 's important that we too in germany get to know our own figures and are happy for them .
besides this issue there 's that of the canonization of greater figures who are examples for the whole church .
i 'd say that the individual episcopal conferences ought to choose , ought to decide what 's best for them , what this person is saying to us , and they should give visibility to people who leave a profound impression , but not too many of them .
they can do it through catechesis , preaching , or through the presentation of a film , perhaps .
i can imagine some wonderful films .
of course , i only know well the church fathers : a film about augustine , or one on gregory nazianzen who was very special , how he continually fled the ever greater responsibilities he was given , and so on .
we need to study : there are not only the awful situations we depict in many of our films , there are also wonderful historical figures who are not at all boring and who are very contemporary .
we must try not to overload people too much but to give visibility to many figures who are topical and inspirational . fuchs : stories with humor in them too ?
in 1989 in munich you were given the karl valentin award .
what role does humor play in the life of a pope ? i 'm not a man who constantly thinks up jokes .
but i think it 's very important to be able to see the funny side of life and its joyful dimension and not to take everything too tragically .
i 'd also say it 's necessary for my ministry .
a writer once said that angels can fly because they do n't take themselves too seriously .
maybe we could also fly a bit if we did n't think we were so important . lanz : when you have an important job like yours , holy father , you are much observed .
other people talk about you .
i was reading and i was struck by what many observers say : that pope benedict is different from cardinal ratzinger .
how do you see yourself , if i may be so bold as to ask ? i 've been taken apart various times : in my first phase as professor and in the intermediate phase , during my first phase as cardinal and in the successive phase .
now comes a new division .
of course circumstances and situations and even people influence you because you take on different responsibilities .
let 's say that my basic personality and even my basic vision have grown , but in everything that is essential i have remained identical .
i 'm happy that certain aspects that were n't noticed at first are now coming into the open . bellut : would you say that you like what you do , that it is n't a burden for you ? that would be saying a bit too much , because it really is tiring .
but in any case , i try to find joy here too . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world youth day 2005 read about the pope 's visit to germany for world youth day in this dw-world.de dossier .

" i think the world cup will raise the trainers ' and clubs ' willingness to take risks , " he told sport1.de .

" we want to play a more attractive style - the players , the coach and the board all want that , " magath told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the wish for a more attractive style is justified , but it can not be achieved because we play against teams that pack their defense and because the pitch conditions , for instance in january and february , do not allow it . " munich won the last two bundesliga championships and german cups but did so with tight defending rather than offensive brilliance , that 's a style that needs to change , according to karl-heinz rummenigge , head of the team 's board of directors . " soccer is a game that lives from fun and joy , bayern has to learn that too , " he said .

" fans have been putting pressure on bundesliga sides to match the national team 's aggressive approach as one of the few leading international teams to play with two strikers . not up to bayern to lead the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has always insisted on results ahead of style many would expect bayern munich , the german league 's perennial favorite with more titles and top quality international stars to their name than any other bundesliga side , to be among the german leaders when it comes to attractive soccer , but there are a number of factors working against them , according to coach felix magath . he said he would like his side to open its style of play and become more attacking than it has traditionally been in the past , but it can not be up to one team to change a league 's direction , especially when there is no pressure on other teams to do so . " we want to play a more attractive style - the players , the coach and the board all want that , " magath told the passauer neue presse newspaper .
" the wish for a more attractive style is justified , but it can not be achieved because we play against teams that pack their defense and because the pitch conditions , for instance in january and february , do not allow it . " munich won the last two bundesliga championships and german cups but did so with tight defending rather than offensive brilliance , that 's a style that needs to change , according to karl-heinz rummenigge , head of the team 's board of directors . " soccer is a game that lives from fun and joy , bayern has to learn that too , " he said .
" starting -lrb- this season -rrb- we will convey the fun of soccer in addition to fitness , discipline and order . " top names leaving bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen kept klose despite foreign interest despite a record amount being spent in the transfer market , more of the world 's most creative players left germany than came to it . last season 's playmakers michael ballack , tomas rosicky , dimitar berbatov , jan koller and johan micoud all left the bundesliga and not even bayern munich proved to have the drawing power to convince ruud van nistelrooy to make the move from manchester . only werder bremen , who finished second to munich last season , could be pleased with the comings and goings in their locker room . bremen signed 21-year-old brazilian midfielder diego , capped 14 times for his country , for a club record six million euros from fc porto and in arguably their best piece of business held on to german international attacker miroslav klose - winner of the world cup golden boot and recently voted german player of the year - amid strong interest from abroad . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga clubs miss out in international player market german soccer clubs have reported mixed results in attempts to recruit foreign talent for the upcoming 2006-2007 season .

" there certainly wo n't be a ' no ' , " said beck , whose party is a partner to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in germany 's ruling coalition . beck suggested germany could help secure the sea or the border to syria , which he said would prevent german soldiers from coming into conflict with israeli troops .
he was the first high-ranking politician from the coalition parties to suggest berlin could deploy troops to the middle east . his comments were met with sharp disagreement from political opponents . " i 'm telling you in all clarity , other nations are called upon , " bavarian premier edmund stoiber , who heads the chancellor 's sister party , the csu , told public broadcaster zdf .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 7,700 german soldiers are currently involved in foreign missions cdu secretary general ronald pofalla said beck 's push was premature .
" anyone who speaks of a bundeswehr deployment must know that the capacities for further foreign deployments of german troops have largely been exhausted , " he commented in the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . the opposition free democratic party also ruled out a german deployment .
if israel does n't mind … foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier laid out the government 's position , telling newsmagazine der spiegel that the israeli government and large parts of israeli society " apparently see no problem in german participation , " the cabinet and bundestag should take that into account when they make a decision , he added . both peter struck , head of the social democrats parliamentary group , and his cdu counterpart volker kauder pointed out that the time had not yet come for such a decision to be made .

13 , 1961 , then-us army first lt. verner n. pike watched the berlin wall go up .
he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .
" my machine gun does n't have any ammunition . " aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .
" it was a terrible time for people in the east .
it was a joyous time for us to help people be free .
the more people we could help , the better we felt .

but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .

" said his wife , alexandra .
" he had a similar experience , struggling against inhumanity in the nazi time . " hildebrandt began helping rescuers who smuggled people into west berlin .
many grateful east germans then donated their tools for historical preservation , and hildebrandt organized them into an exhibit " to show people the truth about the wall , " said alexandra hildebrandt , now the museum 's director . a year later the museum opened next to the famous checkpoint charlie crossing , one of only three border crossings along the berlin wall . it became a place of refugee for escapees and a historical documentation of what one east german general called " the best border security system in the world . " from an activist center to a tourist attraction hildebrandt died in 2004 .
many of the exhibits are his originals , and his wife said there were no plans to modernize them . about 800,000 people a year now visit the museum , which has broadened over the years with art depicting a divided berlin and exhibits on world religions and non-violent protests . outside , a new exhibit set up by berlin officials lays out a timeline of the wall from its 1961 building to the demonstrations that ultimately forced guards to open the wall in 1989 . tourists can also see remnants of the wall , or walk along cobblestones that mark the border where berlin was once divided . elisa ung send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de museum takes controversial look at mundane east germany a new , private berlin museum focuses on everyday life in east germany .

13 , 1961 , then-us army first lt. verner n. pike watched the berlin wall go up .
he talked to dw-world.de about overseeing checkpoint charlie and sneaking east berliners over the border . it was about 1 a.m. on the warm summer night and pike was working the midnight shift , patrolling berlin 's american sector .
he was shocked to see workers digging holes near friedrichstrasse , erecting cement posts and stringing barbed wire between them . over the next few days , " astonishment turned to anger " as he watched east germans fortify the newborn barrier with cinderblocks and fill the streets with traffic obstacles . once the checkpoint charlie border crossing was established , pike was put in charge , giving him a front-row view of pivotal cold war events . during the famous 1961 face-off between soviet and american tanks , pike was the us soldier in charge of initially determining whether the tanks might have been east german . pike remembers that the east berliners working on the new wall were surprised that the american soldiers did not try to interfere . " lieutenant , what are you waiting for ? " one engineer asked pike as he put up cinderblocks .
" i 'm working as slow as i can . " an east german police officer also seemed to hope that the american would stop the wall 's construction . " what are you waiting for ? " he asked , according to pike .
" my machine gun does n't have any ammunition . " aidi n g escapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the famous border sign at checkpoint charlie despite the us government 's vow to accept the wall , pike and his comrades were quietly defiant . in october 1961 , pike took some new soldiers on duty for an orientation in east berlin . " it was ugly , horrible , " he said .
" it was like living in a prison .
these east berliners would come up and beg us , ' take us to west berlin . " ' the soldiers decided to help one young couple .
they concealed them in duffel bags and hid them in the back of their bus .
when an east german guard stopped them at the border , pike demanded to see a soviet officer .
after waiting for 15 minutes with none in sight , the officers defied the east german guard and drove over the border . once in west berlin , " we stopped the bus and opened the back , " pike said . " the couple hugged us and kissed us and kissed the ground .
and they took off running . " pike and his fellow officers repeated this several times , but he wo n't say exactly how many . " the amount of people i personally brought over , my government never knew , " he said .
" i would have been relieved of my duty and probably sent home . " he is proud of his actions . " i was an ally !
i was an american ! " he said .
" it was a terrible time for people in the east .
it was a joyous time for us to help people be free .
the more people we could help , the better we felt . " dismay at checkpoi n t charlie today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pike decries today 's " tourist trap " pike finished his tour of duty at checkpoint charlie in october 1962 . now 69 years old , he is a retired colonel and lives in north carolina . he returns to berlin frequently and said the checkpoint charlie museum is an accurate depiction of life at the border .
but outside the museum , he said he is dismayed at the frenetic tourist activity around the reconstructed checkpoint . " this is a tourist trap , " said pike , gesturing to the souvenir-hawkers at today 's replica of checkpoint charlie .
" i wish it was a memorial .
they are all here to make money and put on a show .
this to me is a sacred place . " " i think the memory of what happened in these years is something that ca n't be put aside .

13 , 1961 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two east german workers put broken glass atop the wall in august 1961 .
the church behind them was later blown up and is now the site of the chapel of reconciliation elke kielberg : i was at home .
like every sunday , my mother had gone to buy the newspaper on bernauer strasse and came back in an agitated state to tell us what was happening - that the streets had been blocked with rolls of barbed wire .
after breakfast , we went down to the train station to meet my great aunt , who lived in east berlin and was meant to come for a visit .
she was standing behind the barricades and we were standing on the western side and the only thing we could do was wave at each other .
it was a horrible shock for us .
my cousin , who grew up in the east , had been like a sibling to me , because somehow we were always together .
we knew east berlin and went there regularly - to the family grave at st. elisabeth cemetery or to take a walk near the märche n bru n n e n -lrb- a fountain -rrb- in friedrichshain park .
we always wanted to do that again , but it was n't possible anymore . what was it like to live so close to the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remains of the wall people are prone to becoming indifferent .
you walked past it and did n't see it any more .
it was there , we knew it divided the east and the west , but you really only noticed it consciously again when state visitors such as lyndon b. johnson and robert kennedy and john f. kennedy were brought to bernauer strasse .
in the beginning , you could still see people jumping out of windows . how did that make you feel ? as a teenager , i was euphoric .
i ran upstairs and talked about how an old lady was dragged from above and pulled from below and thought that it was great that she managed to escape . what was it like to see the wall fall i n 1989 ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two teenagers check out the former death strip through holes in the secondary wall at the bernauer strasse memorial i was still working in the hospital and had a late shift .
i did n't realize what was going on .
i first thought that it was n't possible , that i was crazy .
the next couple of days , i had to walk to work because public transportation was so crowded and when i tried to get money at the bank there were endless lines of people waiting to receive their " welcome money " -lrb- ed . : every gdr citizen was entitled to 100 deutsche marks -rrb- .
that 's when it hit me - and , of course , when my cousin was standing at our door , with her family . do you thi n k there 's still a divisio n betwee n east a n d west ? it 's still present in a lot of heads and i do n't think that 's going to change in our generation .
my cousin was pro-western , but she grew up and went to school in a different system .

13 , 1961 ? hartmut richter : i was spending my vacation with relatives in west berlin 's wedding district .
i remember the day well , it was a sunday , it was hot and we were planning to go swimming just like we had done on previous days .
we were eating breakfast and my uncle came into the kitchen all confused and told us to come look .
" kids , they 're closing the border , " he said .
no one was talking about a wall at the time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in west berlin peek across the wall in aug .
1961 i remember the pictures from the west berlin side , the border patrols , i saw people jumping out of windows .
some smoke-balls were flying and thrown back across the barricades - i was fascinated by that .
my uncle probably felt it was getting too dangerous , because he told us : " kids , go swimming , maybe this is all gone again by tonight . " we did n't think about it any more .
i was 13 and thought that the gdr was the better german state .
i did n't take it seriously .
the only problem was getting back home .
my parents could n't come and get me , so a red cross car picked me up .
i said good-bye just like i always did and wanted to come back during the fall vacation .
i saw my relatives again at easter 1963 .
we met at the zoo in east berlin . how did you feel about the wall ? i was torn .
on the one hand , i had been told that socialism could not be stopped .
on the other hand , half of my classmates were gone because they had left with their parents .
the wall was the " anti-fascist protective barrier , " that 's what they told us in school .
of course it takes time to realize that people were on the wrong path and that i would either have to conform or try and escape .
i saw things like that by the time i was 15 or 16 .
from that point , i planned on leaving this country . bildunterschrift : the bernauer strasse memorial seen from western side : first comes the primary wall , followed by the death strip and the secondary wall on the eastern side . did you n otice the wall ? of course .
i had always looked forward to my trips to west berlin .
but people in the gdr did n't think that this was going to last long . how did you experie n ce the fall of the wall ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a torn cable box still sits inside the death strip at the memorial i 'll never forget that .
i experienced the fall of the wall at the checkpoint at berlin 's invalidenstrasse .
even the soldiers had tears in their eyes .
it was unbelievable . has the wall completely disappeared ? well , people still talk about the wall in people 's heads , and that 's probably how it will stay for my generation .
i 'm more angry about attempts to romanticize things similar to how it happened after the third reich .
i think one should draw lessons from history . mathis winkler interviewed hartmut richter send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : the west berliner : " it was a horrible shock for us " on the day the berlin wall was built , elke kielberg waved at her great aunt across the barricades .

flour prices are set to increase among the biggest bread makers , leading to a rise of two to four pence per loaf .
rank hovis , which owns eight mills and adm milling , which has nine , are both pushing up the price per tonne .
the uk 's recent heatwave in the south east has been blamed for causing poor wheat harvests this year , coupled with the high costs of fuel among producers .
adm milling - which is pushing up flour prices by £ 28.75 per tonne - said its price hikes were an " essential reaction " to rising energy , fuel and wheat costs .
rank hovis is increasing its flour prices by an average £ 29 per tonne next month .
small bakeries hit the two companies together are the biggest millers in the uk .
adm managing director ian pinner said : " this is the third year that we have had to accept increased energy costs which are now 30 % higher than in november 2005 .
" in addition global wheat markets have moved up sharply in reaction to supply and demand figures showing world stocks to be the lowest for 25 years . "
experts said this would mean price hikes of around 15 % to 20 % for major flour users .
the national association of master bakers , which represents around 1,000 small uk bakeries , expects bread to go up by two to four pence per loaf .
chief executive gill brooks said : " the small craft baker will be hit particularly hard . "
gordon polson , director of the federation of bakers , told trade magazine the grocer that bakers were also being directly affected by rising fuel costs .
a spokesman for rank hovis - which owns the hovis brand and supplies own-brand bread to other stores - said the price of its bread was being kept under review .

expulsion has been a tool of many politicians , exhibition organisers say the aim of the organisers of the exhibition at the kronprinzenpalais on berlin 's unter den linden avenue is ambitious - to explore the plight of millions of people who were forced to flee their homes in europe during the 20th century .
there are dozens of examples of civilians who were expelled in europe , ranging from the mass killing of armenians from 1915-16 , the holocaust , to refugees in cyprus and the former yugoslavia .
there are many objects on display , including suitcases , photo albums and other personal belongings which the refugees took with them into exile .
but , controversially , the exhibition also focuses on the suffering of germans who were expelled from poland and eastern europe after world war ll .
german victims the exhibition has been organised by a foundation closely linked to the federation of the expelled , which represents 12 to 14 million ethnic germans , and their descendants , who were forced from their homes .
" it 's clear that expulsion in the 20th century was a common instrument of politicians who did not pay any regard to the fate of humans , " said erika steinbach , president of the centre against expulsions foundation .
the struggle against totalitarianism , nazism and communism ... were the most important parts of 20th century history .
the expulsion , especially of germans , was only a consequence of that slawomir tryc polish embassy official for ms steinbach , who is a christian democrat politician , this exhibition is seen as the first step towards setting up a permanent centre in berlin to remember the millions of germans who were expelled after wwll .
but that is highly controversial , and many politicians and other groups in germany are opposed to the idea .
the organisers are hoping that the exhibition will focus attention on the plight of ethnic germans who were driven from their homes , but also the plight of many other europeans .
" it 's probably not well-known outside germany that at the end of world war ll , around 12 million germans had to leave their homes in the former eastern german provinces and elsewhere , " said wilfried rogasch , the curator of the exhibition .
" it was the largest forced migration in the history of modern europe .
we show this in european context . "
but the exhibition has angered many people in poland and several dozen poles staged a demonstration outside the gallery in berlin on the opening night .
' re-writing history ' polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski has condemned the exhibition as a " very bad , worrying and sad event , " as it " relativised the history of the world war ll " .
the acting mayor of warsaw , kazimierz marcinkiewicz , has cancelled a trip to berlin , saying he could not visit the city while the exhibition was running .
the exhibition is straining ties between germany and poland " my visit to berlin could be misinterpreted and abused under these circumstances , " he said .
critics argue that the exhibition is an attempt to re-write history , claiming that germans are portrayed mostly as victims and the role of the nazi regime is overlooked .
" we think that the struggle against totalitarianism , nazism and communism , and the resistance movements , were the most important parts of 20th century history .
the expulsion , especially of germans , was only a consequence of that , " said slawomir tryc from the polish embassy in berlin .
but the exhibition 's curator says germans should be able to explore all aspects of history .
" i think it 's significant to show that germans were victims after world war ll , " said mr rogasch .
" we know that germans committed many crimes , and that 's well documented .
more than 60 years after the end of the war , we can start to focus on the fate of 12 million germans who were expelled .
this is an important part of our national history . "
relations between berlin and warsaw are strained , and given the reaction to this exhibition from the polish government , it is likely to deepen the mistrust between the neighbouring countries .

mike tomlinson said his wife jane , who is attempting to cycle 4,200 miles across america , is suffering severe pain in her back , hip and pelvis .
her weight has plummeted during the first 2,500 miles of the trip , he said .
but messages of support from other cancer patients were helping the leeds mum get back in the saddle each day .
the mother of three said : " my disease is causing me a considerable amount of pain in my lower back which is making the cycling increasingly more difficult .
" this week there have been some sharp , severe climbs which has put stress on places where i am in the most discomfort . "
this ride is now a matter of how far her indomitable spirit will take her mike tomlinson mrs tomlinson has now passed the mississippi river and route 66 , and is aiming to reach new york by 1 september .
she plans to stop immediately if that does not happen .
she said : " the futility of the trip is not lessening with the miles that have gone , especially knowing that i 've another 1,500 to do in the next three weeks .
" i often wonder why i 'm here , what good it can possibly be doing putting myself through this , not being sure that we are raising enough money to make a difference to people 's lives .
" then this week , at the lowest moments , there have been numerous messages from fellow cancer patients saying what we are doing is helping them stay alive , or live their lives , so i know getting on the bike each day is the right decision . "
she and fellow cyclists ryan bowd , 27 , and martyn hollingworth , 40 , plan to reach cincinnati , ohio , by friday .

portsmouth hospitals nhs trust fears flowers sitting in dirty water could contribute to diseases and may damage expensive bed-side equipment if spilt .
a trust spokeswoman said there was no outright ban on flowers but individual wards could ban them .
the move follows a recent ban by southampton university hospital nhs trust on visitors sitting on beds .
' common sense ' pat forsyth , spokeswoman for the trust , which manages st mary 's and queen alexandra hospitals , said : " this is all about common sense .
" the water gets smelly and that is n't very healthy .
often the flowers are quite highly pollinated , which can upset other patients . "
" also there 's a lot of high-tech equipment , which can be ruined if the vases are knocked over and the vases add to the difficulty of cleaning the bedside area in the fight against infection . "
under new rules in southampton 's hospitals to combat the spread of infections , bedside visitors must sit on chairs and children are only permitted with the ward manager 's approval .

the aim was to raise £ 100,000 for charity despite overcast weather he managed to cross the river in less time than he expected .
he set off just before 0800 bst and arrived on the opposite side of the river , near liverpool 's john lennon airport , just over an hour later .

he walked two miles from ince banks near ellesmere port to oglet shore near liverpool airport .
at low tide on sunday morning there was a narrow channel of water for mr boanas to cross .
the aim was to raise £ 100,000 for charity despite overcast weather he managed to cross the river in less time than he expected .
he set off just before 0800 bst and arrived on the opposite side of the river , near liverpool 's john lennon airport , just over an hour later .
the father-of-two said : " the hardest part is trudging through the sand and mud , it 's exhausting .
" you just have to keep moving all the time and go for it .
it 's unbelievably difficult as the currents are quite strong in the mersey .
" but i 've been training hard in the gym to make sure i was in the best condition .
he added : " i saw a programme about children with eb and i just wanted to help .
" i came up with the idea of walking across rivers , i just wanted to do something different to raise lots of money for them . "

the oilfield 's western side will keep running as pipe repairs and " enhanced surveillance " get under way , the company said .
the move will allow bp to supply up to half of the oilfield 's usual output , which accounts for 8 % of us production .
the site 's eastern half had been shut down after pipes were found to be corroded following a small spillage .
pipe inspection " with greatly enhanced surveillance and response capability , i am confident we can continue to safely operate the line , " said bob malone , bp america chairman .

" right now , i have n't seen any data that suggests we would need to order a shutdown , -lsb- of the western line -rsb- , " said tom barrett , pipeline administrator for the us department of transportation .
the oil giant is also examining ways to enable the eastern side to operate partially , with federal regulators ' permission .
bp has said it will replace 16 miles of pipeline at the site after corrosion was discovered on an oil transit line .
rising prices repairing and substituting corroded pipes could cost around $ 170m -lrb- £ 89m -rrb- , said bp spokesman neil chapman .
it is unclear how this cost would be shared between bp - which owns a quarter of prudhoe 's output - and conocophillips and exxonmobil , which own the rest .
prudhoe bay , which produces around 400,000 barrels per day -lrb- bpd -rrb- , is the largest us oilfield .
the threat to this supply comes as conflict in the middle east and worries over supplies from nigeria have prompted oil prices to hit record highs recently .
on friday brent crude closed at $ 75.83 , but this was some $ 3 below the record high induced by the prudhoe bay leak .
us light , sweet crude reached $ 74.45 .
